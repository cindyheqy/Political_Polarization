Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1063) designating room H–226 of the United States Capitol as the ‘‘Lincoln Room’’. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 1063 Whereas Abraham Lincoln was elected to the House of Representatives in 1846 to represent the 7th Congressional District of Illinois in the Thirtieth Congress from March 1847 to March 1849; Whereas Abraham Lincoln served the people for 15 years as a State Legislator, Member of Congress, and President of the United States; Whereas Abraham Lincoln was a member of the Illinois General Assembly for four terms and was respected as an effective leader of his party and a popular campaigner; Whereas during Congressman Lincoln’s tenure, the room now designated as room H– 226 of the United States Capitol was used as the post office of the House, where he spent almost every morning exchanging stories near the fireplace; Whereas the old post office space was just steps away from Congressman Lincoln’s desk, where he worked and voted and is now marked by a gold plaque on the floor of Statuary Hall; Whereas Congressman Lincoln was known to be the champion storyteller of the Capitol, having an endless repertoire of tales; Whereas Abraham Lincoln was one of America’s greatest presidents, whose life was a story of adversity, perseverance, and leadership; and Whereas when the United States was at its darkest hour, Abraham Lincoln fought to end slavery and brought the country back together: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That room H–226 of the United States Capitol is designated as the ‘‘Lincoln Room’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 1063. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1036 designates the room H–226 of the U.S. Capitol as the Lincoln Room. I appreciate my colleagues’ work on this and find it an appropriate honor for such a distinguished leader of our country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also support H. Res. 1063. This bipartisan bill designates room H–226 in the U.S. Capitol as the Lincoln Room. As we all know, President Abraham Lincoln is commonly considered one of the greatest President’s in the history of the United States. But what you might not know is that President Lincoln, at one point in his career, was a Member of the House of Representatives from the Seventh Congressional District of Illinois. President Lincoln served one term in Congress, from 1847 to 1849, and was known for his opposition to the institution of slavery and the MexicanAmerican war. During his short time in Congress, President Lincoln spent a significant amount of his leisure time in the U.S. Capitol room now known as H– 226. This resolution, which names the room for President Lincoln, is an appropriate honor for a former Member of this distinguished body who led our country in one of its darkest hours. So I support the resolution and urge my colleagues to support it as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 1063. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
AMENDING FEDERAL ASSETS SALE AND TRANSFER ACT OF 2016 TO ENSURE ADEQUATE TIME FOR PUBLIC BUILDINGS REFORM BOARD Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7318) to amend the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 to ensure that the Public Buildings Reform Board has adequate time to carry out the responsibilities of the Board, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 7318 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 7318. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7318 amends the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 to align the timeline for the sale of unneeded properties with the appointment of the Public Buildings Reform Board. This bill will result in more savings for the taxpayer by providing the Board with sufficient time to identify properties to be sold or redeveloped. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also support H.R. 7318. This bill that is under consideration this morning addresses an outstanding issue that has emerged since Congress originally passed the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act, known as FASTA, back in 2016. 
FASTA authorized an independent Board to make recommendations on real estate actions designed to dispose of unneeded Federal real estate and redevelop underutilized property. This bill amends FASTA and aligns the dates of the termination of the Public Buildings Reform Board created by FASTA with the appointment of those Board members. I have worked closely with Chairman BARLETTA during his tenure as chairman of the Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management Subcommittee, and I appreciate his leadership in making the management of real estate more efficient. I also look forward to continuing his work to help the General Services Administration scrutinize the real estate decisions of the Federal Government in order to find savings, promote energy efficiency, and ensure transparency. Towards that end, I look forward to conducting vigorous oversight of the GSA in the next Congress to ensure that the American taxpayers are receiving full value for their dollars that are being invested in Federal real estate. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7318. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
AMENDING FEDERAL ASSETS SALE AND TRANSFER ACT OF 2016 WITH RESPECT TO LEASEBACK OF CERTAIN FEDERAL PROPERTY Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7319) to amend the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 to provide flexibility with respect to the leaseback of certain Federal real property, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7319 amends the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 to provide leaseback flexibility in certain circumstances to facilitate the sale of property and maximize the return to the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 7319. This bill addresses an issue which has come up since the enactment of FASTA in the last Congress. The change allows the Federal Government to temporarily lease back a piece of Federal property in order to facilitate the sale of that property. Ultimately, the goal of this provision is to allow the government to more readily dispose of underutilized property. I look forward to working with the Public Buildings Reform Board, as I mentioned, once all of its members are appointed, and I urge Members of this body to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7319. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

This bill makes technical corrections to the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, which was signed into law on December 4, 2018. It corrects certain dates and updates membership on a Coast Guard advisory committee. Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise also in support of this noncontroversial legislation that makes technical changes to the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act, which was just recently signed into law. I agree that it makes sense to enact these technical corrections at this time to ensure that the amendments contained in Public Law 115–282 are enacted and codified as accurately as possible. I commend the sponsor for his initiative in introducing this legislation, and I urge its adoption. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MAST.

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REPORTS HARMONIZATION ACT Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3367) to amend certain transportation related reporting requirements to improve congressional oversight, reduce reporting burdens, and promote transparency, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3367 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Department of Transportation Reports Harmonization Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 3367. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 3367 enhances transparency for certain Department of Transportation reports, eliminates or sunsets certain advisory boards, and makes technical amendments to the rail improvement grants. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill makes changes to reporting requirements for the Department of Transportation, requiring various agencies to be more transparent to the public by making some of these reports available on DOT’s website. Those would include the Northeast Corridor Safety Committee report and some Federal environmental reviews. The bill also requires that any changes in fees or charges for attending the Merchant Marine Academy be posted publicly online as well. The bill makes the results of State performance targets set in the State highway safety plans publicly available and directs GAO to review States’ progress in achieving these performance targets, including how States are utilizing grants and problems that may be encountered in achieving their targets. The review will be important to Congress when considering the next reauthorization of the surface transportation bill. Finally, this bill sunsets the Northeast Corridor Safety Committee and the National Rail Cooperative Research Program Oversight Committee upon full completion of positive train control along the Northeast Corridor, and it makes technical changes in reorganizing the rail improvement grant section under title 49. It does a lot of good things to improve transparency, both for the public and for Congress. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

LOUISE AND BOB SLAUGHTER POST OFFICE Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7293) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 770 Ayrault Road in Fairport, New York, as the ‘‘Louise and Bob Slaughter Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7293 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill honors the late Congresswoman Louise Slaughter’s 30 years of service to this country. The bill has bipartisan support. I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in considering H.R. 7293, which will designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 770 Ayrault Road in Fairport, New York, as the Louise and Bob Slaughter Post Office. Representative Slaughter was a pioneering, ebullient, and groundbreaking Member of this body whose energetic service on the Rules Committee changed the dynamics and the culture of the House of Representatives. She served here for 31 years, was the first woman ever to chair the Rules Committee, and coauthored the landmark Violence Against Women Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. MORELLE ) for a further brief statement on her remarkable life and career. Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize someone we all know well, a true American patriot, the Honorable Louise M. Slaughter. It is truly a privilege to have introduced H.R. 7293 honoring Louise and her husband, Bob Slaughter. It is particularly fitting to do so in the 115th Congress, with so many colleagues who worked side by side with this remarkable woman. Louise loved Monroe County and everyone who called it home. Through her dedicated work in public service, she made immeasurable contributions to our region, our State, and our Nation. That is why I am proud to sponsor this legislation to dedicate the United States Post Office located at 770 Ayrault Road in Fairport to Louise Slaughter and her devoted husband, Bob Slaughter. The new Louise and Bob Slaughter Post Office Building, located in their hometown just blocks from their house, will be a fitting tribute to a truly remarkable couple. On a personal note, it was Louise Slaughter who counseled me at a young age and encouraged me to run for public office. Louise, Bob, and their family remained dear friends for nearly 40 years. Our entire community grieves her loss and misses her dearly, but Louise left behind an incredible legacy that everyone in this room witnessed firsthand. She was the first and only woman to chair the Rules Committee of the House. Louise was not only a fierce and influential legislator but a true champion for those in our Nation in real need of champions. From landmark healthcare legislation to education and infrastructure projects that have strengthened our local and national economy, Louise was a trailblazer who, with every success, shattered glass ceilings. She was a friend, a colleague, a mentor, and a role model for so many people, both in this room and in my community back home in Rochester, New York. She and Bob Slaughter are more than deserving of this honor, and I look forward to the day when the Louise and Bob Slaughter Post Office is open for business to serve Fairport residents and honor their memory. I am grateful to my colleagues in the New York delegation who have joined me in cosponsoring this legislation. Its widespread bipartisan support is a testament to the profound impact Louise Slaughter has had on all of us and will have on us all for many years to come. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, as the former majority leader of the New York Assembly, Representative MORELLE is a fitting and worthy successor to Representative Slaughter, whom we all miss. I thank the gentleman for bringing this legislation forward. I urge passage of H.R. 7293. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7293. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
FOUNDATIONS FOR EVIDENCE BASED POLICYMAKING ACT OF 2017 Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 4174) to amend titles 5 and 44, United States Code, to require Federal evaluation activities, improve Federal data management, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary Government Data Act’’ or the ‘‘OPEN Government Data Act’’.

To the extent practicable, the head of each agency shall use existing procedures and systems to carry out agency requirements and shall select existing employees for appointments under this Act and the amendments made by this Act. 
Except as otherwise provided, this Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act sponsored by Speaker RYANwould improve government data collection and transparency, while bolstering privacy protections, to better inform policymaking. This bill previously passed the House on suspension. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The Foundations of EvidenceBased Policymaking Act, as amended, would establish a framework to support greater access and use of government data. I thank Speaker RYAN, Senator M URRAY, and Representative K ILMER for their constructive and collaborative bipartisan work on this issue. The goal of the bill is to ensure that Congress and the executive branch are able to make important policy decisions based on evidence, facts, and science. 
We are in very strong support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 4174. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

GOOD ACCOUNTING OBLIGATION IN GOVERNMENT ACT Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2276) to require agencies to submit reports on outstanding recommendations in the annual budget justification submitted to Congress. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2276 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act’’ or the ‘‘GAO–IG Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Good Accounting Obligation in Government, or GAOIG, Act would improve transparency and oversight of the executive branch. This bill enjoys bipartisan support. I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, which is designed to promote the transparency and accountability of Federal agencies. It would require agencies to include in their budget justifications to Congress a summary of the recommendations made by GAO or the agency’s inspector general in the prior year. Agencies also would be required to explain what steps they are actually taking to address these recommendations by GAO or their IG or, if they disagree with those recommendations, why. The GAO and inspectors general provide critical oversight of the executive branch of government and provide Congress with invaluable assistance in helping hold any Presidential administration accountable for its actions and policies. Knowing what agencies are doing or not doing to address GAO and IG recommendations will definitely assist us in Congress in conducting our constitutional oversight responsibilities. This is a commonsense measure that all Members should support. I am delighted to advance it on a bipartisan basis. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2276. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
FEDERAL PERSONAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2018 Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3031) to amend chapter 5 of title 40, United States Code, to improve the management of Federal personal property. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3031 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal Personal Property Management Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Personal Property Management Act of 2018 would improve inventories and accounting of Federal Government property bought with taxpayer dollars. This bill has bipartisan support. I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am rising in support of the Federal Personal Property Management Act, which would improve the accountability of unneeded equipment, furniture, and information technology resources at Federal agencies. It may be an appropriate time for us to take up this bill, given all the furniture strewn throughout the floors of the House of Representatives. The GAO recently found that most agencies do not have procedures in place to identify unneeded personal property on a regular basis. The GSA has issued regulations establishing a governmentwide excess property disposal process, but it lacks the authority to tell agencies how or when to identify excess property. As a result, agencies retain unneeded property that could be used elsewhere in the Federal Government, at State or local governments, or in the private sector. b0930 The report also found there is a wide variation in how Federal agencies classify according to value, which makes it difficult to measure the total value of the government’s personal property holdings. The Federal Personal Property Management Act would direct Federal agencies to assess and inventory more valuable property assets once a year and assets of lower value on a regular basis, according to guidance issued by GSA. Requiring agencies to regularly inventory their excess property should spur agencies to declare excess property more often, allowing for its disposal. The bill also would give the GSA authority to establish a uniform standard for how agencies assess their most valuable property, allowing for a better understanding and use of its value. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3031. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
PERMISSION TO REDUCE TIME FOR ELECTRONIC VOTING DURING PROCEEDINGS TODAY Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during further proceedings today in the House, the Chair be authorized to reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for electronic voting on any question that otherwise could be subjected to 5minute voting under clause 8 or 9 of rule XX. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. f 
CIVIL RIGHTS COLD CASE RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 2018 Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3191) to provide for the expeditious disclosure of records related to civil rights cold cases, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3191 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018’’. 
Until such time as funds are appropriated to carry out this Act, the President shall use such sums as are available for discretionary use to carry out this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 would ensure the integrity of records of civil rights cold cases and ultimately allow public access to them. This important legislation has bipartisan support. I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I support S. 3191, the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act, which represents an important step toward finally solving more than 100 unresolved court cases in the civil rights field. The bill will establish a new civil rights cold case records collection and review board, so the public can review records related to these unsolved cases, with appropriate security and privacy safeguards. The bill will allow the expertise of outside investigators to help bring justice to the families and descendants and victims of these crimes. The bill also will provide a role for Congress in the appointments to this review board, to ensure proper expertise and accountability in the process. It is imperative that Congress appropriate sufficient funding to the National Archives and other agencies to carry out the important mission of this legislation. I urge all Members to support this bill and future funding measures for this endeavor. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3191, the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018. I was delighted when Senator Jones introduced companion legislation to my bill, H.R. 1272, and I am even more excited to see that his bill has passed the Senate by unanimous consent and is now before the House. Mr. Speaker, with the passage of this legislation, families and communities that have waited too long for answers about the loss of loved ones during the tumultuous Civil Rights Era may finally have the chance for closure. Mr. Speaker, this bill came to fruition because of the hard work of a group of students from Hightstown High School in New Jersey and their teacher, Mr. Stuart Wexler. These dedicated students learned firsthand the legislative process, from drafting to markup, to where we stand today, floor passage. I thank them for their dedication to this cause and applaud them for their diligence. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3191. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF WORLD WAR II COMMEMORATION ACT Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3661) to provide for a program of the Department of Defense to commemorate the 75th anniversary of World War II, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3661 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘75th Anniversary of World War II Commemoration Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert in the RECORD extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Missouri? There was no objection. Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill is going to ensure that the Federal Government plays a constructive role in helping to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe and over Japan. In 2020, we expect a number of events and activities, including a flyover of The National Mall, to honor the sacrifices made by many to preserve the freedoms that we continue to enjoy today. The planning for these efforts is already underway, and having the Congress recognize the importance of these activities not only will send a message to the rest of the Federal Government, but, more importantly, to our veterans who have given everything to maintain our freedom. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of this legislation to establish a commemorative program to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. This was fundamentally a war for freedom and human rights. The victory of the Allies in the war and the contributions of America’s Armed Forces must never be forgotten. That is why commemorating this anniversary should be done in an extraordinary way. Commemorating this critical event in history will also allow us to recognize our World War II veterans who are still living. We must listen and learn from their stories while we are still able. I fear that knowledge of history is continuing to decline in our Nation. We must do all we can to make sure Americans never forget the lessons of World War II and all the sacrifices that were made to preserve freedom in the world. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill so we can preserve the memory of the American effort in World War II. I want to thank Mr. GRAVES for introducing this legislation, which is very important for remembering World War II and commemorating it on its 75th anniversary. I thank him for his work. I wish him a merry Christmas and look forward to working with him next Congress. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for all his hard work on this. This is an easy bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3661, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
FREDERICK DOUGLASS TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PREVENTION AND PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 2200) to reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: 
Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. 
TERMS .—The terms ‘elementary school’, ‘local educational agency’, ‘other staff’, and ‘secondary school’ have the meanings given the terms in section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801). ‘‘(ii) HIGHINTENSITY CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING  
Any curriculum, including any continuing education curriculum, for the acquisition workforce used by the Federal Acquisition Institute established under section 1201 of title 41, United States Code, shall include at least 1 course, lasting at least 30 minutes, regarding the law and regulations relating to human trafficking and contracting with the Federal Government.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Senate unanimously passed this amendment version of H.R. 2200, the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, which the House originally passed back in July. It is part of a bipartisan, bicameral package of bills to reauthorize and to strengthen our Nation’s effort to combat human trafficking. It deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. The measure before us reauthorizes the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to make protection for survivors more effective, improve the way we prevent this crime, and ensure that we are prosecuting those responsible. This bipartisan bill passed the Senate unanimously. A very similar version passed the House by voice vote in July of 2017. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me and the chairman in supporting it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, as prime author of the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), it is an honor to present the new Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act. This bipartisan bill—and I thank KAREN BASS for her cosponsorship and strong support—is a comprehensive, reauthorization and expansion of key elements of the TVPA and related policies. In the fight to end modern day slavery, my new bill honors the extraordinary legacy of one of the greatest Americans who ever lived. Born a slave in 1818—we celebrated the 200th anniversary of his birth this year—Frederick Douglass escaped slavery when he was 20 and dedicated his entire life to abolishing slavery and after emancipation, to ending Jim Crow laws, all the while struggling for full equality. A gifted orator, author, editor, statesman (and Republican), he died in 1895. The Frederick Douglass bill before us today authorizes over $430 million over 4 years to prevent human trafficking, protect victims, and beef up prosecution of those involved in this nefarious trade both at home and abroad. It provides: $18 million over three years to the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State to fund the International Megan’s Law $78 million over four years to the Department of Health and Human Services $20 million over four years to the Department of Labor $315 million over four years to the Department of State Additional funding to train airport personnel, flight attendants, and pilots to recognize and report to law enforcement potential trafficking victims in transit Specifically, the new bill significantly expands our efforts to combat trafficking by: Ensuring vulnerable children, throughout the United States, are educated to avoid traffickers; Encouraging job training for trafficking survivors, especially those who were exploited in sex trafficking as children; Preferring in government travel contracts airlines and hotels that have in place antitrafficking training and reporting policies for their employees; Keeping goods made by child trafficking victims out of the United States by ensuring funding for and enhancing Department of Labor reports on slavemade goods; Encouraging enforcement of the Tariff Act of 1930’s prohibition on the importation of goods made with forced labor; Helping survivors get back on their feet by treating civil damages they win from their traffickers the same as criminal restitution; Designating one prosecutor in each of the Department of Justice’s focus districts to investigate and prosecute labor trafficking cases; Preventing abuse of domestic servants in embassies and diplomatic homes in the United States; Encouraging credible and effective use of the trafficking tier ranking system by the U.S. Department of State in the annual Trafficking in Persons Report; and Strengthening implementation of all U.S. laws and regulations in place to prevent U.S. government purchases from putting money in the hands of traffickers and encouraging accountability for U.S. government contractors involved in human trafficking; Empowering trafficking survivors to be more involved in the development of human trafficking policy; and Integrating the fight against human trafficking into U.S. foreign assistance more fully. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2200. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1580 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Girls’ Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act’’. 
ANDCIVILSOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS .—The Sec retary and the Administrator are authorized to work with private sector and civil society organizations to promote safe primary and secondary education for displaced children. 
The Secretary and the Administrator shall include in the report required under section 7 of the READ Act (division A of Public Law 115–56; 22 U.S.C. 2151c note) a description of any primary or secondary educational services supported by programs for natural or manmade disaster relief or response that specifically address the needs of displaced girls. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 1580, Protecting Girls’ Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act, passed the Senate unanimously. It is the Senate version of H.R. 2408, which this body passed last October. Again, this is a very important bipartisan, bicameral bill that will prioritize ongoing efforts to promote access to education for refugee children, especially girls. It deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. The Protecting Girls’ Access to Education Act is a good bill that works to improve access for education for displaced children, especially girls. This bipartisan bill is the Senate version of H.R. 2408, which passed the House by voice vote in October of 2017. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me supporting it, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1580. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1862) to amend the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 to modify the criteria for determining whether countries are meeting the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 1862 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 1862, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, passed the Senate unanimously. It is part of a package of bipartisan bills negotiated between the House and the Senate to reauthorize, reform, and strengthen our Nation’s efforts to combat human trafficking. Mr. Speaker, it deserves our unanimous support, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. This is another good measure to strengthen our government’s response to the horrific practice of human trafficking. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1862. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3247) to improve programs and activities relating to women’s entrepreneurship and economic empowerment that are carried out by the United States Agency for International Development, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3247 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act of 2018’’. 
MICROENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT CREDITS ’’ and inserting ‘‘DEVELOPMENT CREDITS FOR MICRO , 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 3247, the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, passed the Senate unanimously. It is the Senate version of H.R. 5480, my bill, which this body passed on July 17 of this year. It is an important bipartisan, bicameral bill that would expand women’s access to finance and inclusion in the formal economy in emerging markets around this globe. I thank Jessica Kelch, Andy Taylor, and Meghan Gallagher for their expert contributions to this bill and on this issue. Mr. Speaker, this bill deserves our unanimous support, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. This is a bipartisan bill that aims to empower women economically by targeting United States development assistance to womenowned small and mediumsized businesses. As the gentleman from California pointed out, he is the sponsor of the companion bill in the House. This legislation passed the Senate unanimously, and is the companion of H.R. 5480. I urge Members to join me in supporting it. Before I yield back, Mr. Speaker, I just want to say something, since this is probably the last time we will have a chance to debate, the chairman and myself, in this Congress. I have served as ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for the past 6 years, and in the new Congress will become the chairman of the committee. The gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) has served as the chairman for 6 years. I can tell you that there is no better role model than EDROYCE . The bipartisan work we have done together has really made a difference in people’s lives all around the globe. Mr. ROYCE has been a chairman extraordinaire. We have always operated under the premise that, when it comes to foreign policy, partisanship should stop at the water’s edge. And that is what we have really tried to do. I want all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to know that I could not be more effusive in praise of the chairman, the gentleman from California. It has been an honor and a pleasure serving with the gentleman and being his friend. I cannot think of anyone doing a better job than he has done for the past 6 years. I hope he will come back and visit. Whenever I have a question to think about what I will do as chairman in the next Congress, I would think about what my friend, EDROYCE , would do. Then I know I can’t go wrong. Mr. ROYCE of California. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. ENGEL. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. ENGEL of New York for his friendship for over 20 years on the committee, but also for his shared leadership over the last 6 years on this committee. I would also like to thank him for his commitment over the years and for his focus on American values and spreading those values around the globe. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I wish the gentleman Godspeed. I know we will be in touch. We have been a good team. It has been great. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3247. 
The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION AND MODERNIZATION ACT Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 512) to modernize the regulation of nuclear energy. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 512 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to Congress a report describing the status of addressing and implementing the recommendations contained in the memorandum of the Executive Director of Operations of the Commission entitled ‘‘Tasking in Response to the Assessment of the Considerations Identified in a ‘Study of Reprisal and Chilling Effect for Raising MissionRelated Concerns and Differing Views at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’’’ and dated June 19, 2018 (ADAMS Accession No.: ML18165A296). TITLE II—URANIUM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. 
Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 512 makes targeted, commonsense reforms to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s fee structure. The current fee structure threatens to unnecessarily increase the Nation’s nuclear fleet, including the four plants I am so proud to represent in Illinois. This bipartisan bill will ensure transparency, predictability, and fairness in the regulatory process, which will help keep the United States as the global leader of clean, safe, and reliable nuclear power. This bill reflects thoughtful bipartisan and bicameral consensus on what is needed for a robust nuclear industry going forward, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to enact these important reforms into law. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak about S. 512, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act. This legislation contains language from H.R. 1320, the Nuclear Utilization of Keynote Energy Act, or NUKE Act, that I introduced in the House with my colleague, Representative ADAM KINZINGER . The NUKE Act passed the House in September, and I am glad to see that the Senate has also supported these important priorities for the nuclear industry. I would like to thank Senators Barrasso and Whitehouse for introducing this legislation in the Senate, and I want to thank my friend, Representative KINZINGER , for working together to advance the NUKE Act in the House. This legislation is very timely, as the nuclear industry is facing pressure from a variety of factors. Ensuring clarity and reliability for the industry will be an important step, and I believe this legislation accomplishes those goals. Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I would like note that my colleague, Representative GENEGREEN , a cosponsor of the NUKE Act is retiring at the end of this Congress. I want to commend Mr. GREEN for his service to the people of Texas, and I want to wish him the best in his retirement. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. ISSA). Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Energy and Commerce Committee for giving me an opportunity to, one, speak in support of this bill; and, two, take just a couple of minutes to say what is wrong with this body on one bill that you won’t see here today. Back in January, 2 years ago, H.R. 170, one of the first bills to be dropped, was put into the hopper. It was a bipartisan bill that came from the previous Congress and was dropped on the first day. H.R. 170 would reform, after more than two decades, the H1B immigration system, which is broken. Today, more people come in under H1B who are not necessary, not qualified, and not, in fact, in short supply any more than any other nanny, housekeeper, or person just to do basic work. The system has been hijacked because it has not been reformed. More than two decades ago, exemptions were placed in if you paid $60,000. b1115 Mr. Speaker, $60,000 was a lot of money in the 1990s, probably not enough for the highest hightech worker, but pretty good for a brandnew graduate with a master’s degree in the STEM field. Today, we find ourselves, again and again and again, seeing stories about organizations like the University of CaliforniaSan Francisco, Abbott Labs, and Southern California Edison that hire people who come from other countries, almost exclusively from India, and take away American jobs. We see time and time again the Americans having to train them, because they don’t actually know how to do the jobs. And, yes, they are making $60,001. This needed to be fixed, and I commend the members of the Judiciary Committee, both majority and minority, because we worked together on a bipartisan bill and passed it unanimously nearly a year ago. And for a year, we asked for a suspension vote. In these last days, perhaps the last day that I will stand on the floor, I have watched more than 20 bills come across. Some of them are pretty important and noncontroversial; some of them are postal namings and room namings. The fact is that House leadership on my side of the aisle is responsible for holding back a bill that was needed, that the President would have gladly signed, that he even spoke about to the tech community while he was running for office, that was worked out in a situation in which many companies weren’t thrilled with the reform, but they knew it was needed. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to vote for the bill that is before us, but H.R. 170 will not see the light of day from my Republican colleagues. Rather, I will call on the new Democratic majority to do what Republicans were not allowed to do. Let there be no doubt: It would have passed overwhelmingly, perhaps unanimously, on the floor. But if it is not brought up by a new Member and brought to the floor in the first few days, we as a body will be further diminished for having something we know is needed, having something we know was desired and worked out, and, because of some silent force, my own House majority, some Member or Members of the leadership, managed to spike it. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, as my last words on the House floor, to be told by each and every member of the leadership, including the whip, the leader, and the Speaker, that they have no problem with this bill, and they know of no reason not to bring it up, to watch it not be brought up and each week be told maybe it will be there next week under suspension, I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, this is what I will remember as our least fine hour, an example of why Americans don’t trust Congress. Because, even when we agree on something, virtually unanimously, often a silent force manages to keep something that is noncontroversial from happening. Mr. Speaker, as I yield back for the last time in my time on the Hill, I want to tell you that it has been a great honor to serve here. It has been the greatest honor of my life. I wish I could go out not saying to my Democratic colleagues, the new majority: Do in the next Congress H1– B reform, that which you agreed to and which my side failed to do. Mr. Speaker, with that, I thank the leadership. Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I ask my colleagues in the House to support this bill. I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their hard work, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 512. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
ALASKA REMOTE GENERATOR RELIABILITY AND PROTECTION ACT Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1934) to prevent catastrophic failure or shutdown of remote diesel power engines due to emission control devices, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1934 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Alaska Remote Generator Reliability and Protection Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a targeted exemption for remote villages in Alaska from EPA’s most recent emissions rules on diesel generators. EPA and State officials have found that diesel generators compliant with the most recent standards do not work reliably in harsh, cold winter conditions. To preserve the health and safety of the people relying on diesel generators, these are less strict but actually workable standards. Our colleagues in the Senate passed this bill with unanimous consent. It is reasonable legislation that deserves our support. I see Senators WHITEHOUSE and C ARPER were supportive of this bill. It comes out of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. Speaker, I ask our colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S. 1934, which would roll back public health standards under the Clean Air Act for dirty diesel generating units in remote areas of Alaska. This legislation would undermine protections for human health, protections for the environment, and protections for our climate. Adding insult to injury, this bill is being brought up under suspension of the rules at the last minute, over the objections of Democrats. The Committee on Energy and Commerce, which has jurisdiction over the Clean Air Act and where I serve as the Environment Subcommittee ranking member, held no hearings on this subject nor considered any legislation relating to this matter. EPA already gives special considerations for diesel generators in remote areas of Alaska. These special considerations allow remote areas to use stationary diesel generators that are certified to marine engine standards rather than more stringent landbased, nonroad engines. However, all diesel generators in these areas that are model year 2014 or later, and not for emergency use, must be certified to meet EPA’s tier 4 emission standards. If they cannot meet tier 4 standards, then they must meet certain alternative requirements for particulate matter or install an emission control device that reduces PM emissions. S. 1934 directs the EPA Administrator to revise downward the existing New Source Performance Standards for diesel generators, so that these units would have to meet only EPA’s tier 3 standards rather than the more protective tier 4 criteria. Certainly, it is legitimate for Congress to consider assisting these remote areas with unique power needs and pollution problems. However, we should be looking to help these areas obtain cleaner, healthier air, not rolling back standards and pretending that the pollution and associated health and environmental problems don’t exist. Further, I note that the bill directs the EPA, in consultation with the Department of Energy, to submit a report assessing options for the Federal Government to meet the energy needs of remote areas in the State of Alaska in an affordable and reliable manner while addressing air emissions. That study is the right first step, and I would be happy to support it and then work with my colleagues to find ways to help these areas, based on the results of that particular study. Unfortunately, this bill takes the backward approach of rolling back standards and then studying the problem. Perhaps if our Republican colleagues had come to us sooner than this week, we might have been able to find a way to come together on legislation. Unfortunately, Republicans have chosen to take this up without consultation, at the last minute, over our objections. They have left us no option other than to fight. I wish it were otherwise. For the past 2 years, the Trump administration has engaged in a consistent effort to undermine the Clean Air Act and its protections for everything from mercury and hazardous air pollutants to smog and particulate matter. We have seen the Trump administration walk away from the Paris climate agreement, undo the Clean Power Plan, and gut fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles. We must continue to stand firm against these actions that endanger public health, our continued economic well being, and most certainly our planet. Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge my colleagues to stand up for our public health, for our climate, and against those continued rollbacks of our Nation’s most successful environmental statute, the Clean Air Act. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote a strong ‘‘no’’ on S. 1934, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ), the only House Member from Alaska and the dean of the House. (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing this up. This is not a Trump bill. This is a bill that affects one area: Alaska. This bill was asked for by the people who live in Alaska, not New Yorkers, by people who need power, that have not had power. It has been put in, in the past, they can’t meet these standards imposed by the EPA. It doesn’t work in the cold climate. They do not have the money to buy new generators. Some say we have to protect their health. The gentleman from New York is going to shut down the clinics, the schools, and individual homes that cannot be heated, because there will be no electricity. There are no roads. I am talking about small villages, 60 people, 25 people. They all have generators now that are outdated, but that is the only thing they can afford. You know, we hear a lot from that side of the aisle, and sometimes this 
side, about how we are protecting the people. Well, let’s see how you are protecting them when they don’t have healthcare, and they don’t have schools. You really are helping them out. As usual, the other side of this aisle, unfortunately, stands on this House floor and says what is best for people when they haven’t the slightest idea. You know, I don’t wish bad luck on anybody, but maybe we want to have a blackout in New York and see how you would feel in a snowstorm. Maybe we would have some people understand that you are affecting people’s lives directly by not supporting this bill. This is a Senate bill that passed unanimously, supported by TOMCARPER, supported by E DMARKEY , supported by, I think, every Senator. It doesn’t have opposition on the House floor. Unfortunately, this is under suspension, and you will probably have enough votes to defeat this bill. Go home and feel good, say: I did the Lord’s work. I kept the air clean. I protected the people. And you are full of it, really full of it. You are hurting the people, hurting my Alaskans, my rural Alaskans. I stand on this floor and watch this time and time again. Why would you oppose something that is going to help people? Impose an unfunded mandate on these villages is what, very frankly, the EPA has done. The new ones, I might see, but the ones that are established there, I would suggest, respectfully, we ought to let them use that, so they could have heat in their houses, not airconditioning. They can keep their food frozen. They can have their clinics take care of their people. And their schools can stay open. These rural communities of my Alaska Natives, that is who you are hurting. I hear it all the time: We are going to help the impoverished. We are going to help the poor. You are not helping them. You are hurting them. When you go to sleep tonight in your nice, warm house, and you fly in your nice plane, and you get in your nice car and feel good about helping the poor people, I say you are hurting them. Mr. SHIMKUS. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, just to help clarify the argument, obviously, I have a few questions. Define an isolated village. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. A village has, probably, no roads, only an airport, small, fuel has to be shipped in by air or by boat. Mr. SHIMKUS. How long would that flight be? Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. It depends. In some areas, it is 3 hours, and you are having to fly in the fuel. They have had this generator. They had enough money to buy it maybe 10, 15 years ago, and now they will have to put on a socalled air cleaner. They don’t have the knowledge to run it, and it doesn’t work. Mr. SHIMKUS. How many people are in an isolated village? Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Oh, 25, 50, 100. My village that I live in has got 550. That is all. To give you an idea, if the gentleman would yield to me for a second: If you took Alaska, all the land east of the Mississippi River, to the Atlantic Ocean, to the tip of Maine, to the tip of Florida, that is part of Alaska. In that area that I am talking about, Maine to Florida, there are 253 Congressmen and 52 Senators. Think about that. b1130 Think about that. Why I say that, there are no roads, and you are going to punish those people who finally got enough money to buy an older generator by the EPA, an unfunded mandate, and say you are helping them. Mr. SHIMKUS. If the gentleman will continue to yield for a last question, I hear that these new generators cost around $66,000 to $75,000? Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. More than that. Usually, in that area, probably about $150,000, if. Mr. SHIMKUS. So if you have 60 people, that is $1,000 each. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. By the way, there is no income. This is a poverty subsistencestyle life. They do have a school trying to improve their lot. They do have a clinic trying to help their health. But you are going take the power away because you want to keep the air pure? Shame on you. Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague for yielding. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I respect and I share the gentleman’s concern for the people of Alaska. I am talking about a bill that is drafted incorrectly. While it may be specific to Alaska, it is not specific to remote areas. So we can share compassion for the people. I am just saying, if we had done this in regular order and exchanged dialogue with one another, perhaps the outcome would have been stronger. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I spent about a year in Alaska going to college, have been back a number of times, and it is, as the gentleman from Alaska describes, a very unique area. It is unlike anywhere else in America. When you get out into these remote villages, you may fly in in a small Cessna airplane, land on a gravel strip, as I have done, and get out, and there may only be 25 or 50 people there. That is it. By the way, in the winter, it can be— what?—50, 60 below. I have seen that. And I have seen it in spring at break where we had to try to take off three different times on a runway because it had begun to soften up. The snow had begun to soften up, and we had to get out of the plane, turn it around, get back in. Eventually, we had to leave one guy behind in order to get off the ground. This is a very unique place. The poverty that the gentleman from Alaska describes is very real. So, yes, of course, I wish we had had more time to work this out. And to my colleague from New York, he and I have worked out most of these things along the way quite well. This bill came to us late, and, frankly, we didn’t have time to deal with all of the finite pieces. Perhaps we could go back in the next session and do that, but this is before us today. The problem is before us today. I believe this is a reasonable solution and that we should pass it. So, Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to approve this bill and send it to the President. I commit to work to make it even better next year. I won’t be the chairman, I understand that, but Mr. TONKO , Mr. Speaker, will be, I think, the chairman of the Environment Subcommittee, and I would work with him and the gentleman from Alaska. But this is the time, as we know, when things finally get done, and they may not be perfect, but in this case, I would err on the side of passing this bill and then finetweak it later if we have to. This is a real serious issue in these tiny, remote, impoverished villages. I would defer to the gentleman from Alaska, who knows it better than any of us, and encourage passage of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I also want to pay tribute, in closing, to our chief counsel on the committee, Karen Christian, who will be leaving us at the end of this Congress. She has been a remarkable member of the staff, engaged in the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee for years, doing incredible work, and is going off to greener pastures. After 13 years in the committee, I just want to say to Karen: Thank you for your service. Thank you for your leadership. We are going to miss you. Good luck to you and your family. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I’m convinced we have the best members in Congress and the best staff. In her thirteen years with the Committee, Karen Christian has been one of our finest. At the end of this Congress, Karen will move on, and while we are sad to see her do, we wish her well. Karen joined the Committee in 2006 as a counsel on our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. She’s served as both the deputy chief counsel and chief counsel of that subcommittee, and for the last four years she 
has served as general counsel of the Committee. As deputy chief counsel, Karen led several major Committee investigations, including investigations into the Department of Energy’s management of the Loan Guarantee Program, including a failed loan guarantee to Solyndra; the stimulus bill, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; cyber security and critical infrastructure, including an investigation of Huawei Technologies; and the Federal Communications Commission’s handling of a license application from LightSquared. As chief counsel, she led the Committee’s investigations into General Motors ignition switch safety failures; the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including the failure of HealthCare.gov; the fungal meningitis outbreak due to contaminated drugs; mental health care and treatment, including federal programs related mental health and serious mental illness; the opioid addiction epidemic; and the Environmental Protection Agency’s consideration of carbon capture technologies in developing greenhouse gas emissions standards for new power plants. And as general counsel, Karen has been responsible for overseeing and managing the legislative process for the entire Committee— that includes a 27hour, marathon markup in March 2017 and regularly battling to preserve the Committee’s jurisdiction. By every measure, Karen’s time at the Committee has been a complete success. While we are sad to lose our friend, we look forward to seeing her next accomplishments. Karen, we wish you and your family—Dave, Christian, Andrew, and Charlotte the very best. We thank you for your service, your hard work, your guidance, and most of all your friendship. Your work made a difference . . . America is better because of your efforts. Thank you and remember—at Energy and Commerce, the fun never stops. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, to Karen, from this side of the aisle, I wish her well, too. It was enjoyable working with her, and I look forward to working with the Members of the other side of the aisle in the 116th Congress on this issue and others. Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, so I will close saying that I am concerned about the loosely defined language in this bill. I am concerned about the attacks on the Clean Air Act that are so important to all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I will just continue to respond to what the chairman said. I think if we are going to err, we ought to err on the health and safety of Alaskans. I hope my colleagues will join us. I look forward to working with them in the next Congress? Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 1934, a bill that would roll back standards under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for diesel generating units in ‘‘remote areas’’ of Alaska. I understand the motivation behind this bill, but it could set a precedent for weakening existing New Source Performance Standards for diesel generators not just in Alaska, but across the United States. I am committed to finding ways to help Alaskans in remote areas have affordable electricity while maintain health protections. Congress should tackle this issue with an open debate through regular order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1934. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
NATHANIEL P. REED HOBE SOUND NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3456) to redesignate Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge as the Nathaniel P. Reed Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3456 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REDESIGNATION OF THE HOBE SOUND NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 3456 would rename the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge, located in southeast Florida, after Nathaniel P. Reed, who passed away on July 11, 2018, at the age of 84. Nathaniel P. Reed was a prominent conservationist who served as an Assistant Secretary of the Interior from 1971 to 1977 and later returned to Florida to form an advocacy group to help preserve and restore the Everglades. He also joined forces with former Senator Bob Graham to launch the Florida Conservation Coalition. Renaming the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge, which is located near his home in Florida, in honor of Nathaniel P. Reed is a tribute to his legacy of conservation and public land stewardship. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill redesignates the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge in southern Florida as Nathaniel P. Reed Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge. We concur with the gentleman, the majority, Mr. MCCLINTOCK , on this issue. I ask all Members to please vote in favor of the resolution. It is a fitting tribute to a former Interior Department official who helped develop the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. It is a fitting tribute, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3456. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
SPACE FRONTIER ACT OF 2019 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3277) to reduce regulatory burdens and streamline processes related to commercial space activities, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3277 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (51 U.S.C. 60121 note). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE  JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on S. 3277, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Space Frontier Act is a missed opportunity, despite months of negotiations. The House successfully added some positive provisions to the bill, including: Increased the stature of the Department of Commerce Office of Space Commerce to a Bureau of Space Commerce, led by a Senateconfirmed Assistant Secretary of Commerce; Reduced from 120 to 90 days a determination for remote sensing applications; Remote sensing applications cannot be denied if a product will be commercially available within 3 years; Enhanced deadline enforcement for remote sensing applications; Included a lowEarth orbit commercialization program authorized at the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee’s NASA reauthorization level of $150 million. This bill contains some improvements over current commercial space law, but many bold reforms in the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act, which passed the House unanimously, were not included in this package. We have not done enough to encourage commercial space activity, which has the potential to transform research, development, discovery, and access to space. While remote sensing reform is marginally improved over current law in the original version of the Space Frontier Act, it doesn’t go far enough. We set out to change how we think about remote sensing, a growing, constantly advancing, and increasingly commonplace industry that should be free to act unless there is a good reason to prevent that. Instead, this bill only tinkers around the edge of a threedecade outofdate law. This legislation will keep the government in strict control of American companies’ space access and actions, discouraging businesses, and damaging American competitiveness and leadership in space. Meanwhile, other countries are encouraging technology development in an effort to overtake us and grab market share from American companies. This represents a missed opportunity for American businesses that is being stifled by parochial government interests. In the bill before us, there is still room for government employees to ignore the deadline enforcement mechanisms and drag out decisions indefinitely. The bill also doesn’t guarantee that remote sensing companies will be given all relevant information explaining why their applications were not approved. There is also less of an assumption of approval for a remote sensing license application than was included in my bill. Who knows what capability will be quashed because we didn’t fully empower private industry. Congress must remain vigilant in its oversight of remote sensing licensing, and any abuse of the approval process should be challenged. My biggest disappointment is that this bill does not establish a selfcertification regime for private space missions. American space companies are moving overseas because current laws here don’t enable them to conduct business. The Housepassed bill intentionally made it easier to approve private space missions. Regrettably, the Senate killed these provisions. The Bureau of Space Commerce created in this bill needs to use its authority to the maximum extent possible to 
promote, support, and approve private space missions. Mr. Speaker, there is much work left to be done to bolster American competitiveness and foster innovation, and I hope Congress will act next year to continue our leadership in space. With this hope and expectation, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant support of S. 3277, the Space Frontier Act of 2019. I say ‘‘reluctant’’ because the process that brought us to this point is extremely disappointing. Many of the provisions of this bill have not been seriously vetted by the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. I doubt very much whether they were at all vetted by anyone in the Senate. And this bill makes some potentially significant changes to space policy in the United States. b1145 This is no way to legislate. However, there are some good things in the bill. I very much appreciate that the end date for the International Space Station is pushed back to 2030. Now, I don’t know if that date is the proper one, but I do know that the arbitrary decision made by the Trump administration to end the International Space Station by 2024 was wrong. As we move into the next Congress, this is something that I hope to be looking into. I am also glad to see commercial remote sensing language that will help the industry grow, while still considering the government’s legitimate security interests. In short, I will be voting for this bill, in part, because I support the development of commercial space activities and want them to flourish, while still protecting the public interest. However, as the presumptive chair of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee in the next Congress, I certainly will be revisiting some of the other items in the bill. For instance, this bill creates a $150 million office at NASA and doesn’t specify where the money is to come from within NASA, or provide any real specifics to how it will be spent. I would also note that NASA’s vital education programs receive less money than that, so this is a major new initiative and it is something that requires review. I could go on, but, unfortunately, it is clear that there is not going to be time today for a thoughtful discussion of any concerns with the bill or any opportunity to address them. That will have to wait until we have a new Congress. I plan to submit a longer statement in the RECORD which will highlight some of my concerns. For now, it is enough to say that I support NASA’s mission and a robust U.S. space industry and, for that reason, I support this bill, in spite of the awful process that got us here. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have no other requests for time on this side, so I am prepared to yield back if the gentlewoman from Texas is prepared to yield back. Before I do, I just want to thank the ranking member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas, who is, obviously, a Texas colleague and a longtime friend, for all of her good work on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee while I have been chairman of that committee. She has been instrumental in our taking to the House floor and having passed on the House floor 35 bills. Of those 35 bills, 33 have been bipartisan, and that is largely due to her contributions and her efforts to try to make those bills bipartisan. So I do appreciate having worked with her for the last 6 years. I wish her well next year, and I want to congratulate her on being the next chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. But I would like to say, on behalf of my retiring chair, that it has been a challenge. I have learned a lot. I respect and like him. I wish him well for his future, and I hope that he will visit us now and then to see that we will have a little bit of a change in the committee. I hope that we will pass this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3277. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM COMPETITION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2018 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7388) to extend the National Flood Insurance Program, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 7388 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Flood Insurance Program Competition and Extension Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE  WATERS ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the National Flood Insurance Program is a program that has a number of challenges, but it is also a vital program for Americans who live in floodprone areas. The challenges in the program are wellknown. Regrettably, it is going bankrupt. Regrettably, it incents people to live in areas that are repeatedly flooded. Regrettably, it is a program that protects a government monopoly; that is why the House, earlier this year, acted with a comprehensive reform bill. Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the Capitol have yet to act. We do not wish to have the current program lapse; thus, we are on the floor at this very moment. This is a very simple bill. It would provide a temporary, shortterm authorization through the end of May of 2019, regrettably, I believe now, the ninth extension since the House has acted. And it also ensures that we provide certainty, certainty to the market of what the policies of the National Flood Insurance Program are. I was there in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. And one of the great tragedies—there were many tragedies, but one of the great tragedies was how few people actually had flood insurance. So what we want is a system that, hopefully, will see more people have flood coverage written into their homeowners’ insurance policy. So the NFIP wisely had moved in the direction of what they call allowing insurance companies to not have to have a noncompete. This is a current policy of the program, but too many insurance companies don’t believe that policy will stay. So we will ensure that that policy stays through this bill, so that more people in a tragic situation will be covered by flood insurance. So, again, this ensures that current policy is at least extended through May of 2019. It adds certainty to current policy. I know in discussions with the ranking member—who has a lot of expertise in the subject of flood—we negotiated in good faith. We didn’t quite get there on the comprehensive bill, but she agrees that we need this bill, right now, to ensure that current policy is extended, at least through May of 2019. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, allow me to try and explain exactly what is happening with this proposal by my chairman, Mr. HENSARLING . Mr. H ENSARLING came to me and indicated that he wanted to add language to the reauthorization, the shortterm reauthorization of the flood insurance program. I explained to him that I had an agreement with Mr. SCALISE , and our agreement was that this would be a shortterm reauthorization that was clean; that it would be added to the continuing resolution; and that we would see to it that the flood insurance program would not lapse. So Mr. HENSARLING went to Mr. S CALISE and Mr. S CALISE agreed to it and, because he agreed to it, Mr. HENSARLING moved forward. Following that, staff members pointed out that if the language is added that Mr. HENSARLING would like to add, it was going to create a problem. It was going to create a confrontation; that we would endanger the ability to have shortterm reauthorization and, if we do that, homeowners are going to be disadvantaged because they would not have access to the insurance that they need to satisfy the mortgages that they were trying to get. So we have had a long discussion and a long debate about what the Senate is going to do and, of course, our understanding now is that the Senate will not support the language that is going to be put in that is headed by Mr. HENSARLING ; and this was going to endanger the ability for us to get the short term reauthorization. So, given all of that, and understanding all of that, yes, I made an agreement with Mr. HENSARLING that, if Mr. SCALISE agreed, that I would agree, but I want—and I have said to Mr. HENSARLING , as we had a long discussion on the floor with some of the leadership, et cetera, that one of the things we want is, we want this short term reauthorization until May, until we can get to work on longterm reauthorization for the National Flood Insurance Program. Yes, Mr. HENSARLING is correct that we do have the possibility now for private insurers who write insurance for the national flood insurance, to do both, to be able to write insurance. But we do know that even if they are able to do it now, we are not saying that we should do anything to codify that in existing law. They are saying you should not do anything to codify that in existing law, simply because it endangers the ability for the support for the National Flood Insurance Program to be reauthorized through the short term. So it is complicated and it presents a dilemma for everybody. But in the final analysis, no matter what, the real question becomes: Is it important for a shortterm reauthorization of the national flood insurance; or do we allow it to get caught up in these agreements so that we don’t have it, and then the real estate market is going to go crazy; homeowners who are trying to purchase insurance, because they can’t get a mortgage without it, all of this will be absolutely undermined. And that is the essence of what is going on. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I would just point out again, all this bill does is extend for 6 months the current policies of the NFIP. Not one single policy of the NFIP is changed in this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE ), the distinguished majority whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding time to talk about this important program. I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her consistent commitment to making sure that the National Flood Insurance Program is there for families who need it, families all around the country, not just families, by the way, Mr. Speaker, in coastal areas. This is a program that affects every community in our country. It is a program that affects millions of people throughout the country, hundreds of thousands in my home State of Louisiana, but people from all around. It is an important program. Mr. Speaker, I would love for this to be a private program, where there were great options all around for people to buy private flood insurance. Unfortunately, today there aren’t; and so because there aren’t those private options, the only game in town is NFIP. So it is incumbent upon us to make sure that this program works. And it has got to be a program that is fair for ratepayers and fair for taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, over the years, we have had many different longterm and shortterm reauthorizations. It is well documented. It has been one of the frustrations of trying to get consistency in the program, but, in the meantime, it is important that this program move forward. Too many people are counting on NFIP to be there for them that have a closing on a home this week; maybe somebody’s buying a new house for Christmas and they have to have flood insurance. We need to make sure that that program is there for them. So it is important that we continue to keep this going, while negotiations will go on to see if we can get a long term solution. The House came together and figured out a way to get a 5 year reauthorization, but the Senate wasn’t able to put it together. I have no doubt in the future we are going to have those negotiations and find a way to get a longterm reauthorization for the program. I appreciate all the efforts that are being made. But, in the meantime, people know that you can’t just have this program expire as those negotiations go on. So, with that said, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all the parties involved who are negotiating in good faith to try to get this done. Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her continued efforts to make sure that people, millions of people all across this country have that program. 
I want to thank the chairman for his years of service. It has been a long time. We have worked together, both former chairmen of the RSC, and I know he is going to have brighter days ahead. I am sure he is glad that he will have a few more days to live out his current career, but I appreciate the gentleman from Texas’ service over these years to our country in Congress. b1200 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I think that what Mr. SCALISE said is the significant question about this issue, and that is: What do we do today to make sure that we have shortterm reauthorization? If we have thoughts other than that, are we reexamining those thoughts in any way, or do we understand the danger that may be imposed upon our ability to get shortterm reauthorization with any efforts that we are making to codify or place into law the ability for private insurers to participate in the program, along with the way that they participate for the National Flood Insurance Program? I think the significant question is what Mr. SCALISE has said: Will we be able to support shortterm reauthorization with whatever we do today? That becomes the question. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority whip for his kind words and our ability to work together to put together a product that we are both proud of and that the House passed. Again, we regret that those on the other side of the Capitol have not seen the wisdom to put forth any plan. What we have before us is something that is quite simple. If you believe that you want to create at least 6 months of certainty for the market, for the real estate market, residential market, particularly in floodprone areas, then you will pass this bill, because this is the one that creates certainty that every single current policy of the NFIP is extended for 6 months. That is what it does. It codifies one particular policy of the NFIP, and this creates more certainty. This is what people have come to the floor to say they want. Again, I lament the fact we are not doing a 5year reauthorization. I lament the fact we are not dealing with many of the challenges that I mentioned earlier, but at least, today, we can create certainty for 6 months as negotiations continue in the next Congress. Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this lastditch effort to attach harmful policy riders to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) reauthorization. While H.R. 7388 reauthorizes the NFIP through May 31, 2019, House Republicans have attached controversial policy reforms that have been rejected several times by the House and Senate to a bill that would keep the NFIP’s doors open. This harmful policy change was recently implemented administratively by the Trump administration. This policy reverses the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) ‘‘Write Your Own’’ noncompete clause and would allow private insurance companies partnering with and servicing NFIP policies to sell their own competing private policies to unsuspecting consumers. We should not allow private insurers to cherrypick the best risk policies for their own private businesses and force taxpayers to pick up the rest. The Senate has already unanimously passed a clean extension that does not include this toxic rider. The House should ensure that flood insurance remains available to millions of homeowners, businesses, and renters across the country that rely on it and pass a clean extension. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7388. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1536 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ) at 3 o’clock and 36 minutes p.m. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
9/11 MEMORIAL ACT Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 6287) to provide competitive grants for the operation, security, and maintenance of certain memorials to victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: 
On page 2, lines 9 and 10, strike ‘‘, the Pentagon, and United Airlines Flight 93’’ and insert ‘‘and the Pentagon’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6287, sponsored by Congressman TOMMACARTHUR , authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to award grants through a competitive process to nonprofit organizations to operate, provide security, maintain, and increase visitation at U.S. memorials to the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This bill passed the House by voice vote on September 12. Throughout our Nation’s history, Congress has supported publicprivate partnerships with nongovernmental organizations for the operation and maintenance of memorials and museums of national significance. Such partnerships exist at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, for example. The Senate has amended the bill to remove the Flight 93 site in Pennsylvania from the program at the supporting foundation’s request. This bill will ensure that our Nation’s other 9/11 memorials are maintained and preserved for future generations to visit, learn, and reflect. May we never forget the nearly 3,000 Americans we lost that fateful day. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6287 would provide grant funding for the operation, security, and maintenance of the memorials honoring those men and women who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. We concur with the Senate amendment that modifies the term ‘‘covered memorial.’’ We urge our colleagues to support this amendment one more time. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I urge concurrence in the Senate amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 6287. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
DIRECTING THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE CERTAIN CORRECTIONS IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 4174 Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 149) directing the Clerk of the House of Representatives to make certain corrections in the enrollment of H.R. 4174. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this concurrent resolution would correct the enrollment of H.R. 4174, the Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act, sponsored by Speaker RYAN. This important resolution has bipartisan support. I urge all Members to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us would change the enrollment of H.R. 4174 to make several corrections to the bill. Concerns were raised earlier today about the impact H.R. 4174 would have on independent agencies, particularly financial regulators. The changes would make clear that the bill should not apply to monetary policy. It would also make clear that title 1 of the bill applies only to the 24 largest Federal agencies.

b1723 Messrs. GOSAR and DUNCAN of South Carolina changed their vote from ‘‘aye’’ to ‘‘no.’’ So the motion was agreed to. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unfinished business is the question on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, which the Chair will put de novo. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule to come. Mr. Speaker, let me just preface it: I know all of our Members are concerned. I know the majority leader, having spoken to him, is very concerned about what we are doing and when we are doing it. Members, obviously, Christmas is coming, and they want to know what they can do. I am pleased that the majority leader agreed to have this colloquy to give us a sense of the schedule as he sees it. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), my friend, the majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Let me bring clarification. I know there is frustration. I am frustrated as well. I know we would like to be home with our family, but there is work still to be done. Wait. There is still good news. Because the flood bill went down on suspension, we do not want to leave and have that lying out there. So, after the colloquy is done, we will debate the Senate bill on flood. It will take about 30 minutes, and we will come back for another vote series. I don’t want to say anything, but if the bill passed, we would not be back. After that, tomorrow, there are no votes scheduled. We are waiting on action in the Senate. When the Senate has action, I will notify everybody, giving them ample time to come for that vote. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the majority leader agreed to have a colloquy on the schedule. He has given us the schedule. Obviously, there are still a lot of questions, but I understand, and I appreciate the majority leader bringing us as much up to date as he can. Will the flood vote later this afternoon or this evening be the last vote that the gentleman would perceive? Mr. MCCARTHY. For today, yes. I don’t foresee more votes until the Senate acts, if that helps clarify for everyone. Mr. HOYER. I think the Senate vote is still open. Is that accurate? Mr. MCCARTHY. The Senate vote is still open. There is talk. We have our bill over there. I hope they take action. I hope they find that we can find compromise, and then we would all come back together and solve this problem. Mr. HOYER. Well, I hope that can happen. We certainly, on this side—I am sure on your side—hope that can happen as well so that we can get home to our families and celebrate Christmas. The gentleman does not expect any further votes after the flood vote; is that correct? Mr. MCCARTHY. The gentleman is correct. The only votes further will be on flood, and, after that, the only vote I see coming forward would be on funding of the government. When the Senate acts, I will give ample time for Members to be able to have that vote. Mr. HOYER. I understand the angst continues. We all have that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
b1730 NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM EXTENSION ACT Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3628) to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3628 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Flood Insurance Program Extension Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MAC ARTHUR ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is an unfortunate day where we are once again extending the National Flood Program for—I don’t know how many times we have done this. We have been unable to get to the basic reforms that this program demands. But, Mr. Speaker, there are 140 million Americans who live in coastal counties, millions of whom depend on this program to protect them from flood risk. Without this program, they cannot buy or sell homes. If their policies lapse because we allow the program to lapse, they will not be able to buy a new policy, and if, God forbid, a storm like Sandy or like the storms that ravaged the Southeast recently, if one of those storms comes along during that lapse, those people will have no coverage. We simply cannot allow our failure to so negatively affect so many millions of Americans. So, today, we are here to extend the program for another 6 months to give a new Congress time to get to some reasonable bipartisan reforms that will put this program on a solid footing for the future. I am asking that we pass this bill, this extension. It is not perfect, obviously, but it is better than the alternative, and we need to get this done before this Congress recesses. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of this legislation, S. 3628, and the gentleman, TOMMACARTHUR , is absolutely correct. We have to do a shortterm reauthorization. And because of the previous vote, some people are a little bit confused, but they do not have to worry. The previous bill that we voted on was one where Chairman HENSARLING  was attempting to add some language. That failed. So now we have a clean bill before us with one little correction in it, and I would simply ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote so that we can get on with ensuring we have shortterm reauthorization. And I am pleased to say that we have the support on both sides of the aisle to begin to work on a longterm reauthorization, and I think we are going to have good agreement on that. So I would simply ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote today and get this out of the way so that we can move on. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I agree with everything the ranking member said except she turned me into an Irishman. It is ‘‘MacArthur’’ like the general, not ‘‘McCarthy’’ like the majority leader. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ), who has been keenly focused on this issue. b1745 Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I just want to quickly say that I also regret that we are in a situation where we have to once again do a temporary extension, but it is important that we do not let this program lapse. Whether it is Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Harvey, Irma, Maria, or many other disasters we have had, Mr. Speaker, we have flood victims that are trying to rebuild their homes, that are trying to get their lives back in order, and to not have a flood insurance program that gives them the confidence and security that they can reinvest back in their homes and businesses is a dangerous thing for us to do, especially right now during this Christmas season. Mr. Speaker, I also want to say, at a 50,000foot level, we have been myopically focused on flood insurance and only flood insurance policy. Thinking about the fiscal irresponsibility of continuing to allow this program to run the debt that it has, while completely ignoring the fact, Mr. Speaker, that we have spent $1.5 trillion on 220 disasters since 1980, ignoring the fact that thousands and thousands of lives have been lost as a result of our lack of bringing an offense to the table and actually bringing resilient projects to the table, and just focusing solely on flood insurance, which is a reactive policy, it is fiscally irresponsible. We need to bring an offense and a defense to the table. This program needs fundamental reform, but we cannot do it just by cutting checks to people every time there is a disaster. We have got to bring the resiliency measures to the table as part of a package deal here. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption. Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MACARTHUR ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3628. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
DIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE TO MAKE A CORRECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF S. 3628 Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 148) directing the Secretary of the Senate to make a correction in the enrollment of the bill S. 3628. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
H. C ON. RES. 148 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That in the enrollment of the bill S. 3628, the Secretary of the Senate shall make the following correction: Strike ‘‘November 30, 2018’’ each place such term appears and insert ‘‘December 7, 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MACARTHUR ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is a simple technical correction to fix a date error in the suspension bill that we just debated. I don’t think it requires any discussion, other than if we want that bill to pass and have effect, we need to change the date, and that is what this bill accomplishes. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, Mr. TOMMACARTHUR is absolutely correct. I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MACARTHUR ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 148. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on the motion to suspend the rules will be followed by a 5minute vote on the motion to suspend the rules and pass S. 3628.
