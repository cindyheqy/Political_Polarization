Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Bob Allison for his outstanding career in Michigan broadcast media and com-munity activism. For the past 55 years, Mr. Al-lison has brought joy to countless households through his ‘‘Ask Your Neighbor’’ radio pro-gram and work in the Detroit community. In February 1962, Mr. Allison launched his ‘‘Ask Your Neighbor’’ program on WWJ–AM in Detroit, Michigan, and the program quickly be-came a staple of southeast Michigan culture. A light and conversational radio program, ‘‘Ask Your Neighbor’’ is a two-hour call-in show fea-turing area residents sharing recipes, helpful tips and community news moderated by Mr. Allison. The program is well-known as a civil forum that brings listeners together, with Mr. Allison receiving acclaim for his polite and ge-nial rapport with callers. In addition, Mr. Allison also hosted ‘‘Bowling for Dollars’’, a popular game show in the 1970s that awarded prizes based on contestants’ performance in a game of bowling. He is also known for his work and involvement with charitable causes in the De-troit community. An accomplished pianist, Mr. Allison has performed at local service club meetings, weddings and other events. He and his wife, Maggie, have also generously under-written many charitable endeavors and non-profits, including donations to Wayne State University’s Department of Dance and local healthcare organizations. Mr. Allison’s career and work have helped shape the direction of Detroit culture and played an important role in the city’s develop-ment. His kind demeanor and involvement with local organizations have made him be-loved figure, and he is well-known among the community for his philanthropic work. He con-tinues to serve as a host of ‘‘Ask Your Neigh-bor’’, which remains popular among Detroit- area listeners. He has been a strong voice for the city and its residents, it is my hope that he remains engaged in the community in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Bob Allison for his career in media and involvement with Detroit-area non-profit and charitable organizations. Mr. Allison has impacted countless lives through his work. IN RECOGNITION OF UPPER MERION SENIOR SERVICE CEN-TER ON THEIR 20TH ANNIVER-SARY HON. PATRICK MEEHAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 22, 2017 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recog-nize the Upper Merion Senior Service Center of King of Prussia, PA for its twentieth anni-versary. Caring for our senior citizens is a challenging yet immensely rewarding experi-ence to which those at UMSSC have dedi-cated their lives. The Center enables seniors in the Seventh District to live life to the fullest. They facilitate activities that allow seniors to engage in phys-ical, educational, and recreational activities. This social environment and steadfast care helps seniors enjoy their retirement and stay healthy. I hope UMSSC continues to provide their services for many years to come. The senior citizens of our district deserve the best care we can provide and UMSSC is a treasured place that does just that. I congratulate UMSSC for their twenty years of service to our community, and I wish them well in their efforts to provide top quality care for Upper Merion area seniors.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 22, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Phillip L. Ferrell for his 25 years as Pastor of the Mt. Hermon Baptist Church in Belleville, Michigan. Pastor Ferrell has provided important spiritual leadership and community assistance during his decades of service. A lifelong resident of southeast Michigan, Pastor Ferrell has been a strong voice for jus-tice and recognized leader in the community. He gave his first sermon in 1990 and served under Rev. Garther Roberson Jr. in the Mount Olive Baptist Church in Ypsilanti, Michigan, as an Associate Pastor until 1992. In June 1992, Pastor Ferrell was named as Pastor of the Mt.

In addition to serving as a spiritual leader through his work with the church, Pastor Ferrell has been in-volved with nonprofits as a member of the Washtenaw County Literacy Council, which provides tutoring and books for needy chil-dren, as well as the local branch of the NAACP.

He is well regarded among his peers, having served as President of the Min-isters’ Alliance of Ypsilanti, Ann Arbor and Vi-cinity. In this position, Pastor Ferrell helped promote unity and social justice by leading a group of ministers based in southeast Michi-gan in coordinating their outreach and efforts to address issues facing the region. He cur-rently serves as Treasurer for the organization and continues to remain active in a number of other charitable causes and religious groups.

HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 22, 2017 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, Sarah Barton Murphy Chapter, as they celebrate their 62nd Anniversary in Farmington, Missouri. The chapter is an incredible asset to the community, especially as they commemorate the 130th Anniversary of U.S. Constitution Week, September 17 through 23, 2017. To help preserve our American heritage through this national observance, the Sarah Barton Murphy Chapter encourages 5th grade students in St. Francois County to participate in ‘‘Ring Bells for Freedom.’’ They promote county library displays and books on Colonial founders to help residents retrace the Amer-ican story. The Chapter asks all residents of St. Fran-cois County to study our nation’s birth through the events that led to the drafting of the Con-stitution and its signing on September 17, 1787. The Sarah Barton Murphy Chapter of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution works tirelessly to keep their communities aware of America’s amazing heritage. I am honored to recognize the chap-ter today before the United States House of Representatives.
