Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and say farewell to a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce staff who has dedicated more than 20 years of public service to the people’s House. Ed Gilroy began his congressional career on the staff of former Congressman Rod Chandler of Washington, but most of us know him for his nearly 16 years of service as the committee’s Director of Workforce Policy. Ed led our efforts to expand access to affordable healthcare for smallbusiness employees, provide moms and dads more flexibility in the workplace, and protect the rights of workers and employers. When we think about the passage of the bipartisan Pension Protection Act in 2006 and the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, we have to think of Ed. Ed Gilroy has been a trusted adviser, dedicated public servant, distinguished colleague, and an invaluable member of our committee family. We are deeply grateful for his many years of service to the American people and the U.S. House of Representatives, and we wish him all the best in the years ahead. 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST CHARTER  
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, something monumental occurred for students and families who were seeking a new way to pursue a highquality education. Twentyfive years ago, our Nation’s first charter school, the City Academy, opened its doors in St. Paul, Minnesota. City Academy began a new era for school choice and provided families with an alternative option to the traditional public school system. Today, over 3 million students are enrolled in charter schools, and more than 6,800 have opened in over 40 States. Charter schools are not only growing as an option for students, but these schools are also getting results. Innovative charter schools are providing thousands of students and families with the hope and opportunity that they can receive a highquality education and gain the skills they need to succeed for the future. I congratulate City Academy for being a true pioneer in school choice 25 years ago and support the expansion of school choice for American students and families. HONORING ALEXANDER FURNITURE ACADEMY  
Mr. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the efforts of the CVCC Alexander Furniture Academy, located in Taylorsville, North Carolina. This fantastic facility hosts a program where students are taught the basic skill levels required to gain employment as a sewing operator or upholstery craftsman within the furniture trade. Under the leadership of Center Director Eunice Mays and thanks to the generous scholarships awarded by many groups like Craftmaster Incorporated, AHFA, and others, nearly 50 students have graduated, and almost all are now employed. I wholeheartedly commend Eunice and the Alexander Furniture Academy as well as all of its sponsors for putting together a program that doesn’t just teach valuable skills to wouldbe job seekers, but a program that literally helps individuals build the skills they need to succeed from the bottom up. In the last 6 months, students have crafted 90 sofas and chairs and 20 loveseats which have been sold. The profits from the students’ creations are invested in scholarships and help to keep the academy open. I commend the Catawba Valley Community College Alexander Furniture Academy teachers, staff, and students on this terrific program. 
FUNDING FOR THE FAA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS) for 5 minutes. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my dissatisfaction at the majority’s failure to allow consideration of amendments I proposed to the appropriations bill that include funding for the FAA. The Rules Committee did not forward those items so my colleagues could consider and vote on them. 
My amendments represent beginning steps toward addressing what has become an intolerable level of noise from planes in my district. The amendments will not see debate in this body, however, despite the fact that noise affects the health, wellbeing, and economic livelihood of people in every part of the country, whether they are Republicans or Democrats. When Congress directed the FAA to update how we control our airways, we were promised that, by reworking the Nation’s airspace and using satellite technology instead of radars, our Nation’s flight system would become not only more efficient, but cleaner and quieter. Next Generation systems were supposed to allow virtually automated air traffic control, eliminate circling overhead waiting for a landing slot, and facilitate smooth gliding flight descents without noisy engine power. Plus, planes would be able to stay higher longer, and FAA’s published flight procedures would specify minimum altitudes over heavily populated areas, meant to ensure that effects on the ground were minimized. That is not what we got. Eight of the country’s busiest and most complex metropolitan areas, called metroplexes, have seen NextGen implementation so far. Phoenix, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C., are just a few of the metroplex victims who have decided to take legal action against the FAA. The D.C. Circuit Court recently ruled in the Phoenix case, noting that the FAA had not paid enough attention to the effects of its actions. In every case, noise that used to be spread out across a wide area became concentrated over narrowed corridors, visiting misery on those living below. The best analogy I can offer is this: Imagine that all of the traffic using a 6lane highway was narrowed to a single lane. The concentration of that much traffic would surely cause considerable problems. Well, that is exactly what has happened in the southern California metroplex implementation. Areas that used to see planes flying overhead every 15 or 20 minutes now feel bombarded by flights as close together as every 3 minutes or less. As you can imagine, sometimes those planes and narrowed highways might get too close together. Air traffic controllers have to keep minimum separation for the safety of all involved. But in order to adhere to that narrowed lane, controllers tell the pilots to deviate from the flight path by going downward. Sometimes they fly at half, or less, of what the minimum altitude is supposed to be. So planes that are supposed to fly at 6,000 feet may fly as low as 3,000 feet at a frequency of every 3 to 5 minutes. I hope that you can appreciate that that noise is intolerable. Film production of all types, whether TV commercials, movies, or videos, is an economic driver in my district. The neighborhoods of the 37th Congressional District have been used to represent cities and towns across the continent. Though you might not know it, I am sure you have seen both Culver City and the historic West Adams district, built over 100 years ago, in some of your favorite TV shows and movies. Unfortunately, the movie studios of Culver City and the homes of West Adams are directly under the new, narrowed flight path. Studios are complaining about having to move production from their back lots because of the noise. I have elderly constituents who have lived in their neighborhoods for decades and who rely on income from location filming to help them remain in their homes. Film scouts have told them that the frequent loud plane traffic makes it impossible to film there anymore. At this point, countless American and European health studies have demonstrated the harms that come from exposure to noise—and at much lower levels than that experienced by people on the ground. The arbitrary and outdated 65 decibel day/night level that the FAA uses to determine acceptable levels of exposure is calculated at an average of sound over a 24hour period. Parents with young children have told me that their kids’ sleep patterns have been disrupted by unrelenting noise, enough to alter their academic performance. A health clinic serving the affected areas has begun to investigate whether a spike in reported health problems, including poor control of chronic conditions like hypertension, can be related to the constant exposure to excessive noise. The European Union standard for noise exposure at night is half of the U.S. level and is still cause for health concerns there. In the absence of consideration of my amendments, I invite my colleagues to join me and nearly 40 other colleagues in the House Quiet Skies Caucus, which is working to make progress on this important issue. My constituents and I know many of my colleagues’ constituents are suffering under the burden of excessive airplane noise as a result of the implementation of the FAA’s Next Generation project. We cannot and must not sacrifice the health of those on the ground in the name of airline efficiency. 
CALLING ON THE SENATE TO MAKE CTE A PRIORITY THIS FALL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, during the August indistrict work period, I had the privilege of visiting CPI in Pleasant Gap, Pennsylvania. CPI is the Central Pennsylvania Institute of Science and Technology. I was proud that my colleague, Congressman RAJAKRISHNAMOORTHI of Illinois, was able to join me in Pennsylvania’s Fifth District at CPI on the first day of school. CPI was founded in 1969 to meet the career and technical education needs of high school students in Centre County. By combining academies with technical training and industryrecognized certifications, CPI is uniquely poised to prepare students for rapid employment and longterm career success. CPI offers more than 18 secondary programs, over 60 inhouse adult and continuing education programs, and more than 350 online courses. In addition to exceptional classroom and handson instruction from a highly qualified, experienced faculty, CPI offers certification in a wide range of disciplines, a notable advantage to CPI graduates and their employers. Congressman KRISHNAMOORTHI and I were at CPI to talk about our bill, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This House unanimously approved the bill in June, and I call on the United States Senate to make it a priority for this fall. Mr. Speaker, our bill is the first major overhaul to the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act in more than 10 years. The bipartisan legislation strengthens and improves career and technical education and gives Americans the skills they need to compete for indemand jobs. This can be witnessed firsthand at CPI. This November, CPI will launch a new 2year degree program: Natural Gas Compression—CAT/Ariel Emphasis Associate of Specialized Technology. The program is in partnership with the Cleveland Brothers, a Pennsylvania based Caterpillar dealer, and Ariel Corporation, the world’s leading manufacturer of natural gas compressors. CPI is currently accepting students for a November 28, 2017, start date. It is only one of two programs of its kind nationwide. Ariel Corporation compressors and CAT engines are located in oil and gas fields throughout the world. Graduates of CPI’s natural gas compressor degree program will have an opportunity to work locally, nationally, and globally. Cleveland Brothers, Ariel, and gas industry partners will be interviewing the NGC students after the first term. If prehired by the program’s industry partners, students will receive companysponsored tuition reimbursement. Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the type of career and technical education investments we should be making and encouraging. By educating Americans in highdemand fields, they can climb rungs on the ladder of opportunity and obtain familysustaining jobs. I will continue to advocate for these important reforms that will benefit Americans from all walks of life. I urge the Senate to take up our bill without delay. It is important to close the skills gap and give every American a chance at having a fulfilling career. 
b1015 Now, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman KRISHNAMOORTHI , for traveling to Pennsylvania to see this program in action. I want to thank the staff of CPI for not only hosting us on the first day of school, but for working to educate students in their chosen fields. Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to act on this bipartisan bill without delay because it is critically important to closing the skills gap in this country, and above all else, it is a win for the American worker and American families. Let’s help all Americans learn to earn. 
HONORING ARMY SPECIALIST MATTHEW TURCOTTE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, on August 23, Army Specialist Matthew Turcotte was killed during a live ammunition exercise at Fort Carson in Colorado. Specialist Turcotte was a lifelong resident of North Smithfield, Rhode Island. He joined the Army 2 years ago and was assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. He died a hero, having earned numerous medals for his service to our Nation, including the Army Achievement Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Last Saturday, hundreds gathered in Providence to give Specialist Turcotte a hero’s farewell at his funeral mass. All of us know, who serve in this Chamber, that our country owes an enormous debt of gratitude to all who have served, and especially to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice on the altar of freedom. My thoughts and prayers are with Specialist Turcotte’s family today, especially his wife, Megan, and his parents, Raymond and Liza. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I also want to spend a moment to speak about President Trump’s decision to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It is one of the cruelest in Presidential actions in recent memory. This was a shameful moment for our country. America has always stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity, but not right now. The DACA program has allowed nearly 800,000 DREAMers to work, study, and serve their communities and Nation. That includes nearly 1,300 DREAMers in my home State of Rhode Island. The DREAMers are workers and taxpayers. They pay $3 billion in taxes each year, including $2.6 million in my home State. They contribute $2 billion each year to Social Security and another $470 million to Medicare. They didn’t choose to come here. They were brought here by their parents as very young children. They love this country. They share our values. They are contributing to their communities every single day. They are young men and women like Lesdin Salazar, a 22yearold Rhode Islander who came here from Guatemala with her parents when she was 7 years old. Lesdin was a high school junior when President Obama signed an executive order to establish DACA. She was later accepted to Rhode Island College, where she is paying out of pocket today to pursue a degree in teaching. Lesdin also works at Calcutt Middle School in Central Falls, Rhode Island, where she helps kids who need behavioral and emotional support, but she will have to give up this dream unless Congress acts. The same is true of Ana Abigail Molina, a 27yearold Rhode Islander who came to the United States when she was just 6 years old. Today Ana works at Thundermist Health Center and has dreams of going back to school to become a surgical technologist. And like so many DREAMers, Ana doesn’t really remember much of the country where she was born. She considers herself an American. Javier Juarez also considers himself an American, a young man who just graduated from Rhode Island College and is planning to attend graduate school on an academic scholarship at Brown University starting this fall. His dream is to one day attend Harvard Law School. Javier has been living in Rhode Island for 18 years. Before DACA, he couldn’t drive, get a good job, or go to college, but now he is the first member of his family to graduate from a 4year university. He, too, will have to give up his American Dream unless Congress acts. And finally, Maribel Rivera Sosa, who came to Rhode Island from Mexico at the age of 9. When she graduated high school 5 years ago, Maribel didn’t think she would be able to attend college, but just days later, when President Obama established DACA, Maribel’s opportunities became limitless. She was able to attend the Community College of Rhode Island while working three separate jobs. After earning an associate’s degree, Maribel enrolled at Johnson & Wales University, and her dream is to earn a master’s degree in health administration. Who among us thinks that someone who works three jobs shouldn’t be able to follow their dreams? This is just cruel. President Trump is ripping apart hundreds of thousands of families and injecting chaos and uncertainty into the lives of members of our community who know no other home than America. If Congress doesn’t replace DACA with the Dream Act, it will result in $460 billion in lost economic activity over the next decade, including $61 million in Rhode Island. Republicans in Congress need to bring the Dream Act to the floor right now. We need a permanent solution, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bipartisan Dream Act. We need to bring that bill to the floor. Every Republican who disagrees with President Trump’s actions needs to tell Speaker RYAN to bring the Dream Act to the floor. This Congress must act in a manner worthy of a country that has inspired these young DREAMers and pass the Dream Act without delay. 
AFGHANISTAN: EMPIRE STOPPER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, on September 4, 4 days ago, The New York Times International Edition carried a story, entitled, ‘‘The Empire Stopper,’’ which said foreign powers have tried to control Afghanistan since the 19th century. The story had a very interesting first paragraph: ‘‘When the American author James A. Michener went to Afghanistan to research his work of historical fiction ‘Caravans,’ it was 1955 and there were barely any roads in the country. Yet there were already Americans and Russians there jockeying for influence.’’ Continuing the Times’ quote: ‘‘Later, the book’s Afghan protagonist would tell an American diplomat that one day both America and Russia would invade Afghanistan and that both would come to regret it.’’ Michener wrote that 62 years ago. Since then, Afghanistan has been described many times as the ‘‘Graveyard of Empires.’’ This 17year war in Afghanistan has always been more about money than anything else, and it should have been ended long ago. Many people wonder why we keep sending so many soldiers and military contractors to Iraq and Afghanistan. Well, it has always been about money, increased appropriations for the Defense Department, and huge profits for the contractors who hire retired admirals and generals. There have been so many examples of waste, fraud, and abuse in these Middle East wars that it is sickening. One recent example was reported this way by Newsweek: ‘‘U.S.based security firm Sallyport Global has been accused by two former internal investigators of smuggling alcohol, stealing, keeping two different account ledgers, and even human trafficking of prostitutes while executing an almost $700 million contract to protect Balad Air Base in Iraq, The Associated Press reported Wednesday.’’ Military bases should be protected by military personnel, not highly paid contractors, but most Members of Congress are afraid to criticize anything the Defense Department does for fear of someone saying they are not ‘‘supporting the troops.’’ We now have over 11,000 troops in Afghanistan and probably that many or more contractors in addition to no telling how many Federal civilian employees. Then we are also paying more than 
330,000 Afghan military and police personnel. The international community is now providing 60 percent of the Afghan GDP, and almost all of these socalled peacekeeping—really, U.N. wars—the U.S. taxpayers are paying over 90 percent of the cost. When the socalled coalition bombs go astray killing civilians and women and children, they are really seen by the locals as being U.S. bombs, creating even more hatred and resentment for our country. We have now had almost 2,500 young American soldiers killed in Afghanistan and 20,000 wounded, many maimed for life. We have spent $1 trillion directly on this war and even more indirectly. Mr. Speaker, the American people don’t want forever, permanent wars. This Afghanistan folly has lasted four times longer than World War II. We should have come home a long time ago. 
PERSONAL STORIES OF DREAMERS IN PORTLAND The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I was standing next to JOHN LEWIS as we joined our Democratic colleagues from the House and the Senate who delivered a spirited message of resolve to fight Donald Trump’s cruelty towards almost 800,000 young Americans and, of course, several million other members of their families, their friends, their employers, who all had their lives turned upside down by Trump’s senseless, unnecessary decision. Strange for somebody who professes to love the DREAMers, Trump is caught in his own trap. He clearly didn’t know what he was doing, trying to figure out ways to pass responsibility for his decision on to others. But, of course, that is sort of what we have come to expect from someone who appears to care only for himself. He was afraid, even, to deliver the message himself. Typical of Donald Trump, he outsourced the decision to Jeff Sessions, who Trump spent most of the summer demeaning. Now, I think there is a simple solution: take it back. Donald Trump is famous for mulligans on the golf course, doovers. If he didn’t like the shot, he would just do it again. Well, let’s declare a DACA mulligan. Take it back. Yes, it might look foolish, but that really hasn’t stopped him before. In the meantime, the outrage builds: the community of faith, the business community, people across the country who are understanding the lunacy of this decision, its unfairness. But the most telling and powerful points are from the young DREAMers themselves. My colleagues have delivered this message from people whom they have heard from in their districts. I have countless ones that have been shared with us. Jamie, a 31yearold father of two, a DACA recipient, was 12 when his family fled to the United States to escape poverty and corruption. For 9 years, he has dedicated his life to helping young people cope with these challenges. He is working with young people impacted by the issue, concerned about their mental health and their wellbeing. Eddie arrived from Mexico as a 1 yearold baby. He really didn’t understand the impact of being undocumented until he applied for college and was not eligible for Federal assistance, but eventually he attended and graduated from Portland State University; and he has become the first undocumented student admitted to Oregon Health & Science University School of Dentistry. Scheduled to graduate next year, he wants to be able to serve the community that raised him. Karla, arrived as a 4yearold, is currently a student, but whose concern is the message that is being sent to others whom she works with. DACA recipients are not all young professionals or valedictorians. Some work in fastfood restaurants and are struggling to get through community college. She makes the point that some may call her a DREAMer, but she felt that the real DREAMers were her parents, who had the dream for her. They fought to come to this country to raise her and give her the opportunity to work, attend school, and live without fear of deportation. These are compelling stories, Mr. Speaker, but the one that stands out in my mind most clearly was one of my first meetings after the election. I was meeting with a number of the young DREAMers, listening to their concerns, their apprehensions. The conversation stopped with one young man who just said, ‘‘What country should I go to?’’ He had choices to go to Canada or Europe. He was an accomplished student, ambitious. ‘‘What country should I go to?’’ I must admit, at the time, I counseled him to not give up on the United States too quickly. I wonder what he thinks today. 
HONORING CLIFF GLOVER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of one of the Third District’s most upstanding citizens, Mr. Cliff Glover. Mr. Glover passed away last month at the age of 104, but not before touching countless lives in our community. His community service began at a young age in the Boy Scouts, an organization that he would work with for the rest of his life, earning the rank of Life Scout and the Silver Antelope Award for his service to the organization. Mr. Glover also served his Nation in the Civil Engineer Corps of the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War II, working on the U.S. Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida, now known as Cape Canaveral. b1030 In the private sector, Mr. Cliff successfully led the BatsonCook Construction Company as it built many important buildings and developments throughout the southeast. I consider myself blessed to have known Mr. Glover personally, and his commitment to serving others helped inspire my own public service. I want to challenge all of my colleagues, friends, and neighbors to carry on his legacy of serving others. f 
A 21ST CENTURY AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes. Mr. DEFAZIO. Well, Mr. Speaker, I was just reading a message from Citizens for On Time Flights. Now, I fly a lot and I would love to be on time more. They are talking about our aviation system here. Air traffic control is a World War II relic and saying that if we only would give it over to the private sector, i.e., the airlines, it would work better. Well, let’s see, a couple of things wrong with that statement. Number one, the greatest problem with air delays is weather. Now, actually, we are dealing with that technologically through a new system called Datacom, where, at our 55 busiest airports, the pilots and the air traffic controllers now can communicate by text and they don’t have to repeat over and over on the radio the messages; many fewer misunderstandings, easier to reroute. This has been implemented by the FAA. What is the number two cause? Oh, it is airline operations and scheduling—the airlines themselves. They are the second greatest cause of delays, they, in themselves. So it turns out that Citizens for On Time Flights is actually funded by a group of airlines. Now, what is the bottom line here? Do we have a World War II relic, as Gary Cohn has said after he read some of this and heard this propaganda? No, actually. We have the most advanced system in the world. We could fly planes today closer together using GPS technology called ADSB and not use the older radar system, except—the system is up and running, except the airlines won’t pay to put the equipment in their planes. They say it is too expensive. So they are complaining about the FAA and saying they could do a better job, they could do it more efficiently, they could fly planes closer together, but they won’t invest in the equipment. 
Now, it is very expensive. For instance, American Airlines would have to spend 40 percent of last year’s baggage fees to equip every one of their planes so they could use this modern system—40 percent of their baggage fees. Wow, what a hit they would take for that. Now, what is the bottom line here? The bottom line is we fund the current system—the largest, most complex, most advanced in the world—with a tax on the tickets. It is a progressive tax; the more you pay for your ticket, the more you pay for air traffic control, 7
1⁄2percent tax. For years the airlines have said to me: That’s our money. I said: What do you mean it’s your money? I pay the tax when I buy a ticket. They said: No. That’s our money. We should have it. In fact, a few years ago, when the FAA bill expired for 2 weeks because of a chairman named John Mica, every airline in America, except for one— when the 7
1⁄2percent tax went away for 2 weeks, every airline in America, except Alaska Airlines, raised their ticket prices 7
1⁄2percent. So what is the bottom line of this bill? This bill—going to be pushed by the Republicans over here—would repeal the 7
1⁄2percent tax. That would be a $10 billion windfall for the aviation industry. And then what? How are we going to pay for it? Well, the private corporation will decide. Congress will have nothing to say about how it is paid for, and it is going to be paid for with a head tax. So you get on the plane; they will say: Oh, it’s 50 bucks to sit in that seat, to use the public airspace of the United States of America. That’s how the corporation is going to pay for it, with a head tax. So we go from a progressive tax to a regressive tax. If you buy a $50 ticket, you are going to pay 50 bucks to sit in the seat. So it is now $100. Today you would have paid $3.75. So that is the real bottom line here. It is not about efficiency. It is not bringing the system up to date. Now, they have done a great job with this propaganda, and the chairman of the committee has done a great job. They talk about those paper strips. They use paper strips in the traffic control towers. Well, yeah, we do. It works real well. We replaced them in the en route centers, but we haven’t replaced them yet in the towers. It is infallible. It has worked forever. It is efficient. But we are going to go to electronic flight strips, and we are going to do it in a way that actually is going to improve the efficiency of the system and dispatch planes better. Now, they say: Well, Canada has electronic flight strips. Yeah, they did it for billing purposes because they charge per flight. They don’t, and are not going to, have the new system we are going to have, which is going to sort out all the planes by their future routes, everything as they depart from the airport, and it is going to be way more efficient. So, actually, the FAA is doing an excellent job. And 7 to 10 years ago I never would have said that. But they have got it straightened out over the last 7 years. Randy Babbitt and Mr. Huerta have got it straightened out. It is working today. There is a GAO report, which I am releasing today, which the Republicans tried to repress, which says, in fact, the system is on time, on budget, and, in fact, privatization will delay the modernization of the system. So the House is going to push and the Republicans are going to push for a bill that actually is going to set us back instead of moving us forward into the 21st century air traffic control system. f 
HOUSTON STRONG The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, a monster Category 4 hurricane named Harvey hit my home. It hit us very hard. And 2 days after the first blow, it hit us once again. It reversed course and hit us twice in the span of 2 days. It took out our schools, our shops, our homes, our pets, and the lives of over 50 Texans. But there is one thing that Harvey can never take from us, and that is, we are ‘‘Houston Strong.’’ Houston Strong is the Smith family. Annie was going into labor as her apartment was being swallowed up by floodwaters. She and her husband, Greg, were doctors. They prepared to have a home delivery of their first child. Their phone calls for help were unanswered. Annie called her church and, within an hour, a rescue truck drove up. That is her right there, being assisted on the rescue truck an hour after she made that call. Twelve hours later, their family grew by one. Their daughter, Adrielle, was born. The Smith family is Houston Strong. Houston Strong is Buster Stoker and the Cajun Navy. Buster and his buddies from Louisiana brought 14 boats to rescue others in our disaster. Buster said: ‘‘There were a lot of submerged cars and street signs underneath us.’’ It reminded Buster of cypress knees in the marshes at home. Buster rescued over 100 people, seven by seven. Buster and the Cajun Navy are Houston Strong. Houston Strong are our first responders, our police officers, firemen, EMS drivers, our military, the entire Texas National Guard. And first responders include normal, everyday Texans like this man carrying a mother and her baby out of harm’s way. Texans are Houston Strong. Two days ago, I took a helicopter tour of the damage with Leader MCCARTHY . The crew on our Coast Guard helicopters rescued 2,000 people in harm’s way. And I am sure this scene was played out over and over inside those helicopters—a neighbor, glad to be alive, her hand resting on a rescuer’s shoulder. Our first responders are Houston Strong. Houston Strong is the thousands of volunteers who have been in shelters and churches and schools all throughout southeast Texas. I went to this high school, Cinco Ranch, in the Katy Independent School District. This was up and running within 24 hours of getting the go order. They had food, water, toiletries, clothes, and a smile. I saw on those people who lost everything smile after smile after smile because of volunteers at shelters like Cinco Ranch High School. Shelters in Cinco Ranch are Houston Strong. I have saved the best for last. This young boy’s name is J.W. Claburn, IV. He lives in my district, Richmond, Texas. This young boy’s photo is exactly what I have been trying to convey these last 5 minutes. In closing, I will say that we—America is strong, Texas is strong, and Houston is stronger because of Hurricane Harvey. 
CONDEMNING PRESIDENT TRUMP’S DECISION TO END DACA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn in the strongest possible terms the President’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. This issue should be very simple. These are children who were brought here by their parents, through no fault of their own. They grew up with our kids, attended the same schools, played on the same playgrounds, and learned to drive in our neighborhoods. These kids are Americans in their hearts and in their minds, just not on paper, yet. Beyond that, my faith, my conscience, my understanding of basic economics prevents me from supporting this cruel and inhumane decision by President Trump. If we are to love our neighbors as ourselves, we must remember that we, too, were once strangers in a strange land. Many of us have our own immigrant stories, stories of how we became Americans. My family’s story begins like many of yours. My greatgrandfather, Metro, was born in Austria in 1881, and my greatgrandmother, Margaret Skrutt, was born in Ukraine in 1882. They got married and knew that they could find a better life in America; so, in 1906, they took a chance and came to America, arriving on November 1, 1906. They settled in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, because other Ukrainians already lived there. They joined the community, worked hard, 
went to church, raised a family of Americans, including my grandmother, Anna Guryesh. My greatgrandparents’ story is the story of America. It is the story of immigration and immigrant families dreaming of a better life and making America great. It is the same story repeated 24 years later when Mary Anne McLeod boarded the Transylvania in Glasgow on May 2, 1930. Nine days later, she arrived in New York with $50 in her pocket. Eightysix years later, her son was elected President of the United States of America. At the age of seven, a young woman left Cuba, fleeing communism. In 1989, she became the first Latina elected to Congress, and it is a privilege to serve with her. Melania Knavs was born in Slovenia. She first became a permanent resident, and then a citizen of the United States. This young lady, born in southeastern Slovenia, now lives in northwest D.C. as the First Lady of the United States of America. Daniel, one of my constituents who I helped with his DACA status: He works hard, pays his taxes, loves this country, his country, as much as any other American. So many great Americans are Americans by choice, not by birth. This has made America the greatest, strongest, wealthiest country in the world. We can attract the best, the brightest, the most driven and the most talented. People like Dr. Elizabeth Stern was born in Kansas, but, in 1915, became an American. She drove forward our ability to detect and treat cancer. b1045 Author Ayn Rand, a favorite of the Speaker, was born in 1905 in Russia, and came to the United States in 1926. Actress Natalie Portman, born in 1981 in Jerusalem, came to the U.S. as a toddler. Alonso Guillen was born in Mexico but died last week as an American hero working to save lives during Hurricane Harvey. At the last Olympics, Americans born in places like Australia, Kenya, and Poland brought home nine medals, including two gold for the United States. Their stories are all the same. They came to America seeking a better life and a better future. They contributed to our society and our culture. They made America great. Margaret and Metro’s story is America’s story. America’s story is Mary Anne’s story and Daniel’s story. This is the story of us, the story of America. It is a story that no President’s pen can erase. America’s story is Melania’s, Ayn’s, and the story of Albert. We are America, and we are here to stay. No matter where you were born, we are America, and we are here to stay. No matter what language you speak to your mom in, we are America, and we are here to stay. We are America, and we are here to stay because America’s story is our story. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
HEROIN AND OPIOID USERS NEED ‘‘A WAY OUT’’ OF ADDICTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today full of sorrow and hope for those caught in the cycle of addiction to heroin and opioids. This destructive plague is taking aim at Americans across the country— young and old, rich and poor, rural and urban. Nowhere is this more true than in the Chicagoland area, a hub for drug trafficking spreading across northern Illinois, the Midwest, and the United States. The collar counties of Chicago have felt it strongly. This year, in Will County alone, there have been 61 accidental overdose cases and 44 deaths from heroin and fentanyl overdoses. This is an extremely discouraging pace, surpassing previous years. The numbers are similar across the seven counties that I represent in the 14th Congressional District. Stories have been long untold, and it continues to gain national attention. It still haunts our communities today. I got involved in this issue more than 3 years ago when I met Ken Chiakas, who lost his 17yearold daughter Stephanie to a heroin overdose. Together, we launched our community action plan on heroin, an analysis of our community leadership forum on the problem, an audit of existing and proposed community partnerships, and the next steps for our communities, our State, and our county. In the years following this initiative, I have hosted meetings with law enforcement officers, treatment center workers, advocates for patients and lost loved ones, State and local government officials, emergency room physicians, pharmacists, and drug manufacturers. Last month, my staff and I traveled throughout McHenry and Lake Counties to hear from local officials firsthand who are experiencing this plague every single day. Law enforcement first responders are on the front lines fighting drug traffickers and dealers. They are also saving lives by reviving abusers in the midst of an overdose through the use of naloxone. It is now common practice in these police and sheriff’s departments to have naloxone ready to be deployed in the hands of capable and trained officers. Many lives have now been spared through its use. But even these encouraging numbers do not tell the whole story. Countless others live and struggle to fight heroin and opioid abuse every day in search of treatment and battling towards recovery. They know what it is like to face an overwhelming force controlling their lives. It affects their relationships, it affects their outlook on life, it affects their ability to obtain and keep quality jobs. Local officials expressed great concern at the loss of workforce, and the many months and years of career advancement and experience those caught in addiction have lost. Businesses are concerned by their search for qualified workers that doesn’t yield enough or any applicants. Families are concerned that, without adequate outpatient treatment, their loved ones are far more likely to relapse, compounding these workforce and community problems. That is why, among other programs, Lake County law enforcement has worked hard to implement the ‘‘A Way Out’’ program. Police officers and sheriffs’ deputies come into regular contact with those caught in heroin and opioid abuse, sometimes seeing the same offenders in police stations and prisons several times a month. Many of these men and women want to be free but don’t know how, and a police officer is the last person they think to ask for help. A Way Out empowers police officers and opioid users to work together to end the destructive cycle of abuse, dependency, arrest, and relapse. The program is simple. Those who seriously want help can ask for it from a police officer or at a police station and can receive help without fear of arrest or inability to pay for treatment. Officers who see the destruction of opioids every day want to help. All that is required is for the person seeking treatment to choose the path of recovery. Individual motivation is essential to success. As of last summer, 15 people at 8 different police departments have taken advantage of this initiative. Similarly, DuPage County launched Project Connect, a prearrest program through which individuals who have been administered Narcan are immediately offered treatment options and a case manager to see these men and women through to recovery. I am so encouraged by and proud of the success stories I hear throughout the 14th Congressional District every day. Hope is near when those in recovery see a vision of what their life can be like after dependency—a life filled with healthy relationships, challenging and meaningful work, and a clear sense of individual purpose. We must do all we can to offer this hope to those still suffering from heroin and opioid addiction. Connecting affected individuals with the people and organizations best equipped to help them is paramount to overcoming this devastating epidemic. It remains my goal to make northern Illinois the hub of the best minds and the best practices in heroin and opioid abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery. I look forward to sharing these 
best practices and recommendations across other congressional districts and the communities that we are here to serve, and ultimately to see lives saved. 
KEEP THE DOOR OPEN FOR DREAMERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, we all suffer when this country breaks its promises. But for our children, that cost compounds. They pay the interest on our inaction and inadequacy. They pick up the pieces of the precious things that we broke, the sacred resources we took for granted, the battles that we were too afraid to fight. Time and again, by choice and by chance, they have not disappointed. Their broad shoulders carry twice as much twice as far. Their spines prove twice as sturdy as the adults meant to protect them. American history is littered with the names of young men and women, and even boys and girls, forced to be heroes before their time: the patriots of D day, memorialized in a statue called the Spirit of Youth in Normandy; 14 yearold Emmett Till, lynched by a lie; Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, all 14, and Carol Denise McNair, 11, four choir girls lost at the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Alabama. The Children’s Crusade. Little boys and girls, kids, who dared defy Bull Connor’s firehoses and attack dogs to be arrested and rearrested again and again as a Nation recoiled in horror. Nine AfricanAmerican high school students from Little Rock marched into an allWhite high school to prove that separate is not equal. Four college students from Kent State who gave their lives to a war weary nation’s plea for peace. Thirteenyearold Ryan White from Indiana who showed our Nation that an HIV diagnosis does not claim your dignity. The record number of men and women under the age of 21 who showed up at military recruiting stations in 2001, signing up to serve a nation reeling from terror on its soil. Nineteenyearold Zach Walls who told us that love is love as he bravely defended his two moms before the Iowa State Legislature. Seventeenyearold Lila Perry from Missouri who withstood the sting of stigma by being true to herself and her gender identity. Thirtyoneyearold Alonso Guillen, a Texan who traveled 120 miles from safety into the heart of Hurricane Harvey’s fury on a volunteer rescue mission, who gave his life so that others, strangers, might survive. His courage and sacrifice exemplify the best traits of our Nation. They place him squarely on the long list of young American heroes who have carried us toward a more perfect union. But this week, President Trump slammed the door on 800,000 people like Alonso. DREAMers. Children raised in our neighborhoods, who run on our playgrounds, who pitch in our Little Leagues, who proudly march in 4th of July parades, who make lemonade stands, build snowmen, go to prom, and get summer jobs, who hit the books, who earn a living, who raise families of their own, who serve in our military, who give to this country just as much, just as faithfully as you or I. Now, our President told them that they are not wanted, that he would rather see them in handcuffs, their families ripped apart, their futures in limbo, sent to be strangers in a strange land. Mr. Speaker, sometimes this body has to make hard choices. Sometimes our solutions are complex. This is not one of those times. This one is easy. Our work comes down to a very simple question: What are we willing to ask our children to bear? We have the power in this body to say: Not this, not again, that we will not ask the youngest among us to force our country’s conscience to awake because of the burden that we, the adults in the room, place on their shoulders. We can do better. We can be braver. We can change the course of that history. We will not stand here and leave it for future generations to wonder why we allowed such harm to pass. 
KEEPING GUAM SAFE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced a resolution with 21 of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle condemning the threats North Korea made against Guam last month—you can imagine the fear that we had during this period—but also reaffirming the United States’ absolute and unshakeable commitment to Guam’s security, as well as that of the Pacific States, the territories, and our AsiaPacific allies. Mr. Speaker, this threat against Guam and, indeed, our entire Nation, was inexcusable, and it demands firm condemnation from this House of Representatives. My resolution sends a clear message that North Korea’s continued willful disregard for U.N. resolutions, international agreements, sanctions, and arms controls in pursuit of its illicit nuclear weapons program will not go unanswered by our government. I remain fully confident in the defensive capabilities on Guam and in our region, but it is vital that we do all that we can to prevent a military conflict with North Korea and ensure that its regime does not continue down this path of reckless and destabilizing nuclear militarization. I want to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution with me, and I hope that the House leadership will quickly bring it to the floor for consideration, and I urge all the Members to support it. CALLING FOR THE HOUSE TO TAKE UP THE  
Ms. BORDALLO. On a separate topic, Mr. Speaker, I also want to echo my Democratic colleagues in calling for the House to quickly take up a permanent legislation solution such as the Dream Act, H.R. 3440, and lift the veil of anxiety that has been placed on nearly 800,000 DREAMers who live in and contribute to our community. b1100 I know one of those DREAMers on Guam. Her name is Christine. She is a registered nurse on our island and works every day to save lives in our community. And it is easy, Mr. Speaker, to hear the number 800,000 and forget that these DREAMers are real people. They are individual children or young adults who study in our schools. They work. They pay taxes. So can you imagine how disruptive this must be in their homes? They are our neighbors, our coworkers, our children’s classmates and friends. They are first responders, servicemembers, reservists, National Guardsmen, active military who serve on the front lines in our military. They are nurses, and doctors, businessowners, and entrepreneurs, and all DREAMers contribute to the fabric of our great country of America. So I hope that we will give these DREAMers the security of knowing that they will not be deported from the country that they love and have called home for most of their lives. They are Americans in all but paper, and we should treat them with the same compassion and love that they have for our great country. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO COACH ROBERT HUGHES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I was privileged to see something very special back in December of 1995 in Texas high school sports history. Now, before you think this is a story of ‘‘Friday Night Lights,’’ it is not. This happened on the hardwood court of the Wilkerson Greines Activity Center in southeast Fort Worth. Four coaching legends on the court, all with 1,000 wins each: Morgan Wooten of DeMatha Catholic High School; Ralph Tasker, Hobbs High in New Mexico; Bill Kruger of Clear Lake High School just outside of Houston; and Coach Robert Hughes, Sr., of Dunbar High School located in Stop Six, Texas. They squared off in an extraordinary basketball game. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that of these four coaching legends, Coach Hughes has the most wins with over 1,300 victories. 
Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, Friday September 8, will mark another special moment in basketball history for Coach Hughes as he is inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. Growing up in Fort Worth and having lived part of my childhood in Stop Six, I knew of Coach Hughes at a very young age. He was a legend before he retired. He is and was a master basketball strategist, coach, mentor to the boys he coached and the most prominent ambassador for high school sports in the State of Texas. When you would go to a Dunbar basketball game and watch Coach Hughes work his craft, you ended up watching Coach Hughes as much as you watched the action on the floor. I saw this as a player that not only played against Coach Hughes, but also as a spectator and a fan for many, many years. Hughes and his longtime trusted assistant, Leonadas Rambo, fielded some great teams to rack up over 1,300 victories. These wins were racked up at Dunbar High School and I.M. Terrell High School, which was shut down after desegregation. Coach Hughes would pace the floor while his teams ran up and down the court at a swift pace. He usually gave them lots of latitude when they made mistakes that he felt could have been avoided by using better judgment. It didn’t matter if you were the star point guard or the sixth man, he would stand up from the bench—and Coach Hughes always had his jacket unbuttoned—and with a look of disapproval on his face that was unmistakable, he would look down the bench—and I am going to say he would look down the bench with his signature look of tough love—and you knew that you were being pulled out of the game. There wasn’t anything that your mom or dad could do for you. That was the type of coach that Coach Hughes was. Coach Hughes earned the dedication of his players because of the excellence that he expected each and every day. I will never forget in one Whataburger Basketball Tournament in Fort Worth when Dunbar was playing Oak Hill Academy from Mouth of Wilson, Virginia. Oak Hill had at least five or six guys that were all over 6 foot 8, three of whom went on to major Division I careers at the University of Virginia and Kansas. Everybody at the gym that night, because Coach Hughes didn’t have anybody over 6 foot 5, 6 foot 6, thought that Coach Hughes was outmatched. But with superior rebounding, patience, and good shot selection, Dunbar won the game. I was there, and I vividly remember the audience being shocked, but inspired, by the victory. But no one should have been surprised. Once a reporter asked Coach Hughes who his favorite NBA player was, and it surprised everybody when he said Larry Bird was his favorite player. The reason why: he liked Larry’s legendary rebounding, fundamentals, blocking out, scoring, the type of things that may not have been fancy but led to victories. But that is who Coach Hughes was. That was the kind of excellence Robert Hughes brought to coaching Fort Worth ISD and boys basketball in the State of Texas. And due to that fierce competitive streak in Coach Hughes’ Dunbar teams, they always made the playoffs. I will never forget one day Coach Hughes was quoted in the paper saying that the people who worked in the neighborhood, who worked at the various jobs around town, at General Motors, Miller Brewery, and Lockheed, they would always save up their vacation time so they can go to the quarterfinals and regional games in Midland, because everybody knew that Dunbar was at least going that far. And he could say that because it was true, and his teams could back it up. I will never forget one year when Dunbar didn’t make it that far and Coach Hughes shared his scouting report with another school. I believe it was Southwest High School. He shared his scouting report with the coach from Southwest of the team they were getting ready to take on in the playoffs because he felt that at least the other team in the Fort Worth Independent School District should have the chance to advance. That is the kind of class act he was on the court and he still is off the court today. The men that he made, Mr. Speaker, his former players include current winning high school basketball coaches and one of the top alltime assist leaders in high school and college sports history, James Cash, an I.M. Terrell graduate who was the first Black player in the Southwest Conference who went on to become the chair of the Harvard MBA program. In a State known for its Friday night lights, Mr. Speaker, there is not a single other person in high school sports who exemplifies this like Coach Hughes. Mr. Speaker, I am humbled with the opportunity to recognize the next member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, Coach Robert Hughes. Congratulations, Coach Hughes. Go Wildcats. Go I.M. Terrell. 
REFORM CLOTURE RULE IN SENATE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks after the 2016 election, I spoke on the House floor and warned that the greatest single obstacle to meeting the expectations of the American people was the cloture rule in the Senate. I said: ‘‘Voters elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress and they expect action. They’ll get it from the President and from the House. But in order for the Senate to rise to this occasion, it must reform its cloture rule.’’ Well, it didn’t. Now, cloture is the Senate motion to conclude debate, and it is based on a sound parliamentary principle that as long as a significant minority—currently, 40 Members of the Senate— want to continue to debate, that debate should continue. This principle assumes it is an actual debate between real people regarding the merits of the subject directly at hand, but that is not what cloture has become. Today, any Senator can block virtually any bill simply by filing a protest, and until 60 of the 100 Senators agree to take up the bill, it cannot be heard. Thus, a motion designed to protect debate has now degenerated into a motion that very effectively prevents debate. It also hands practical control of the Senate to the Democratic minority, which can effectively veto any proposal by the majority, essentially reversing the result of the last election. This is not some act of God or constitutional constraint that has been forced upon the Senate. No, this is a deliberate choice by Senate Republicans not to reform their cloture rule. It has rendered the Senate dysfunctional and, with it, the Congress. Earlier this year, the Senate briefly recognized this and chose to reform cloture for Supreme Court nominations, but not for the legislation absolutely vital to the interests of our country. The news yesterday that the President has now had to capitulate to Democratic demands on the debt limit should come as no surprise. By failing to reform cloture, Senate Republicans have effectively given CHUCK SCHUMER  operational control of the Senate. That is how we got wrapped around the axle on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. The House could have passed a comprehensive bill that completely and cleanly abolished ObamaCare and fully replaced it with all of the market and tax reforms that Republicans agreed with and campaigned on, popular reforms that put consumers back in charge of their healthcare decisions and placed those decisions within their financial reach. Instead, the House leadership chose to attempt this through a budget process called reconciliation, a process completely unsuited for complex policy reform. They did so for one reason: to bypass the Senate cloture rule. By adhering to the very limited and restricted requirements of budget reconciliation, the House produced a mangled, tangled mess that fell well short of the reforms we had promised and, ultimately, failed to receive even a simple majority of the Senate. Those who supported this process argued that a clean, complete, comprehensive bill would have been dead on arrival in the Senate for lack of Democratic votes for cloture. Well, I doubt that. Quite the contrary. Had the House done its job through regular 
order rather than trying to cover for the Senate Republicans’ bad choice, one of two things would have happened: Senate Democrats would have been seen as the single obstacle to a popular, comprehensive reform while ObamaCare continued to implode and, quite possibly, eight of the most vulnerable Democrats would ultimately have crossed party lines and supported this rescue of our healthcare system; or, far more likely, Senate Republicans would have been forced to come to the same conclusion that they came to with respect to the Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch and reform this rule. Certainly, we couldn’t have been any worse off than we are today. I would ask that, henceforth, the House leadership stop covering for the Senate Republicans and move all of the legislation that we promised the American people to the Senate through regular order. It is time we left the management of the Senate to the Senate, stopped enabling their atrocious judgment on not reforming cloture, and made it very clear to the American public why the reforms they entrusted us to enact aren’t being sent to the President. Senator Dirksen once noted, when they feel the heat, they see the light. It is time the House and the American people adopted this maxim. 
HONORING FALLEN KISSIMMEE POLICE OFFICER MATTHEW BAXTER AND SERGEANT RICHARD ‘‘SAM’’ HOWARD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) for 5 minutes. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, it happened on a Friday night, August 18, that Sergeant Sam Howard and Police Officer Matthew Baxter responded to a report of three suspicious persons around Palmway Street and Cypress Street in Kissimmee. I remember hearing about it. It was unfortunate because a veteran, a marine who lived in our community, had a moment of posttraumatic stress disorder and ambushed these two Kissimmee police officers, killing one nearly instantly and the other only a little over a day later. Officer Matthew Baxter was 27 years old. He grew up in Baltimore and moved to central Florida after high school. He had been with the department for only 3 years. He met his wife, Sadia, a detective of the Kissimmee Police Department, on the job. He left behind his wife and four young children, the youngest under a year old. He was courageous and passionate in his devotion to public service, and he was known as a sharp dresser and as someone with overwhelming confidence. Sergeant Richard ‘‘Sam’’ Howard was 36 years old, born and raised in Kissimmee. He served in the Army and fought in Iraq. He was a 10year veteran of the department and a member of our SWAT team. He left his wife, Billie Jo, and teenage daughter, Unique, behind. My wife and I got to visit his wife’s classroom and brought supplies to her students, knowing how difficult it was. He was a family man, hardworking, very optimistic, and quite the fast talker, as we were reminded by everybody during his wake. There are moments like these that test our will, our strength, our compassion. There are moments like these that test our community and even our faith. And more than we can ever imagine, there are moments like these that test the families of Sergeant Sam Howard and Officer Matthew Baxter. We are here today and I am on the floor today to proclaim aloud what we already know in our hearts to be true. And make no mistake about it: these men were heroes, and we will never forget their sacrifices. They are heroes because they got up every day and put on the Kissimmee Police uniform. They went out in our community every day to protect us. And, yes, they put themselves in harm’s way every day to keep us safe. These men are heroes because they were good family men. They were loving husbands, great fathers, and they were pillars of our community. b1115 Yes, these men were heroes because when the moment came where they had to lay their lives on the line to protect our community, they did so without hesitation. For those reasons, we will never forget Sergeant Sam Howard and Officer Matthew Baxter. On August 21, 2017, an American flag was flown over our Capitol in honor of Sergeant Howard, and on that same day, an American flag was flown over our Capitol in honor of Officer Baxter. These flags cannot take away the pain caused to their families. They cannot take away the pain caused to our community, to their fellow officers, and to the police department in general. But they were flown over our Nation’s Capitol for a very good reason—to show that their lives matter, their sacrifices matter, and that their families matter. For that, they remain in our hearts, they remain in our thoughts, and they will always be in our prayers. God bless Sergeant Sam Howard, Officer Matthew Baxter, and their families. God bless the city of Kissimmee, and God bless the United States of America. 
DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. VARGAS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the recent decision made by the Trump administration to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. By ending the DACA program, this administration leaves 800,000 people, mostly young adults and children, without any legal protections. DACA gives these individuals, most of whom were brought to the United States as very young children, the opportunity to work hard, study hard, sustain their families, and contribute to their communities. DACA recipients are taxpayers, they are students, they are soldiers, and they are our neighbors. I would like to mention one DACA recipient that I know. Her name is Jacqueline. Jacqueline was brought to the United States when she was 2 years old. She excelled in school and was an Advancement Via Individual Determination—or what we call AVID—student in high school. She did very well. She was a strong candidate for admission to many of our top universities. When DACA was announced in 2012, it helped Jacqueline come out of the shadows and pursue her educational dreams. She did exactly that, and now she is a double major. She is doing very well. DACA gave Jacqueline and her family hope for a better future. It gave her a chance at the American Dream. By ending DACA, this administration is taking away the hopes of 800,000 DREAMers like Jacqueline and threatening their deportation to countries that are very unfamiliar to them, places they may have never known— except, of course, when they were 2— and they have no family there. I would like to thank the religious leaders who have come forward and have urged us to do the right thing and to pass a law to allow these kids and these young adults to stay here and to participate in our community as they have been doing. I would like to read a letter now that was written by the religious leaders here in Washington to the President. As leaders of the three Abrahamic faiths, we look to our sacred texts and traditions in seeking to follow the way of peace. Our respective teachings are clear, and we speak with one voice when we say: Supporting the dreams of young immigrants in the United States is consistent with the foundational values of our Nation and with the moral imperative of extending hospitality to the stranger, of caring for immigrants and children, and of loving our neighbors as ourselves. Nearly 1 million young immigrants have benefited from the DACA program since its inception in 2012. Among that number, many of the program recipients are members of our respective faith communities as well as the communities we mentor in and around the Nation’s Capital. We have witnessed firsthand the relief and pride in our young people’s faces as they finally came to feel validated and safe by participating in a program that made them feel more at home—in the only country that they have ever really considered their home. But now anxiety and fear for their future has returned. We note that DACA has widespread support across the country and among politicians who agree on little else, for good reason. DACA has dramatically improved the lives of these young people and the communities in which they live: 
Ninetyfive percent of the DACA participants are working or attend high school; Sixtyeight percent of those working have seen their pay increase and, thus, are paying higher taxes; Fifty percent now have driver’s licenses, which makes the roads safer for everyone; Fiftyfour percent have purchased their first car; and Twelve percent have purchased their first home. Rescinding DACA would have a widespread, devastating impact not only on a generation of industrious young people, but also on their families, communities, and our society as a whole. Thus, we add our voices to those urging you, Mr. President, to keep this policy in place until Congress puts in place a permanent solution. It is our collective prayer that in the coming months congressional leaders work together to pass sensible and comprehensive immigration reform that our country so desperately needs, including making the DACA program permanent. But until that time comes, the least that our country can do is to continue supporting our DREAMers. Keep DACA in place, Mr. President. Faithfully, The Right Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington; Rabbi Bruce Lustig, Senior Rabbi of Washington Hebrew Congregation; Imam Talib M. Shareef, The Nation’s Mosque; His Eminence Donald Cardinal Wuerl, Archbishop of Washington. 
Mr. Speaker, we can do the right thing. We can pass comprehensive immigration reform, and we should. But at least we can pass DACA. I know, Mr. Speaker, that there is goodwill on both sides. Let’s come together over this and do the right thing as our community leaders and as our religious leaders are asking us. 
DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, today is not a good day for our Nation. Today, 800,000 young people across this country are living in fear. They fear being ripped apart from the only home they have ever known. They fear being separated from their families, from their friends, and from the lives they have built here. They fear deportation, Mr. Speaker, and they live with this fear because President Trump has decided that the Federal Government is going to break its promise and turn its back on DREAMers. These are young men and women who did not break the law—they were brought to this country as children— who went to school here, who work here, and who pay taxes here. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program brought these young people out of the shadows and offered them some relief. It gave kids who grew up here and who truly believe that America is their home a chance to lead normal lives and chase their dreams. The fact of the matter is, though, Mr. Speaker, that DACA did not go quite far enough. DREAMers are American by every measure except for their paperwork, and it is time that we offer them a path to citizenship. That is why I am here today to call upon my colleagues to bring the Dream Act back to the floor for a vote—no policy riders, no packages, just a straight upordown vote. Because if there are Members of this Chamber who still believe that DREAMers should remain in the shadows and that they should not have a chance to join our Nation as citizens, then they should stand up and be counted. Many of my colleagues here come from all walks of life. They have charted their own path, however difficult it may be to join this House. DREAMers have earned that chance to carve their own path, too. They have earned the right to live without fear and in peace as Americans. Passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, it is the moral thing to do, and, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is the American thing to do. f 
HURRICANE HARVEY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, on August 26, Hurricane Harvey began a path of unprecedented destruction across southeast Texas. The historic levels of rainfall were so extraordinary that the National Weather Service had to add new colors to its map graphics just to record it. As of August 30, it was estimated that 24.5 trillion gallons of water had been dumped over Texas and Louisiana. Harvey is now being called the most extreme rain event in United States history. Year after year, the natural disasters that hit the United States are becoming more frequent and more severe. Democrats understand the root cause: climate change. It is long overdue for President Trump and the congressional Republicans to admit the truth. Quickly following the tragic news that Harvey was on a path to cause catastrophic flooding in Texas, President Trump pledged to help pass the necessary financial aid to begin the long recovery. But, of course, the President and Members of Congress all knew we had better not deny or delay funding for this very devastating natural disaster. The American people expected their government to quickly respond to Harvey. However, we must understand that there are other laws and policies that must be protected, laws that determine what the Congress can do and must do to assist our country with mitigation, preparedness, mapping, and affordable national flood insurance. The NFIP must be dealt with and must be understood. So Mr. Trump’s previous record on the issue is appalling and is in direct contradiction to his latest pledge. Just days before Harvey made landfall, Trump repealed an Obama executive order that would have required the Federal Government to account for climate change so that infrastructure could be built to withstand catastrophic events. Trump also sent Congress a budget that cuts funding for programs that help us understand, prepare for, and recover from storms like Harvey. His budget slashes operations and funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s climate research, cuts $62 million from the National Weather Service, eliminates the Regional Coastal Resilience grants, guts Coastal Zone Management grants, and cuts $190 million from the National Flood Insurance Program’s flood mapping program. Trump’s budget would also cut $114 million from the Department of Agriculture’s disaster assistance that would help farmers recover livestock, crops, and equipment that would be felt in Texas where many farms are currently under several feet of water. His budget also completely eliminates HUD’s Community Development Block Grant and HOME programs, vital grant programs that serve as one of the first available sources of funding to help communities recover even before disaster relief funding can be appropriated from Congress. What is more, Trump’s budget would have cut $876 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, the very fund that he is now pledging billions of dollars of support for. So we are pleased that he learned after the fact. All told, Trump would cut billions of dollars for disaster preparedness and disaster relief programs. Of course, he also appointed a known climate change denier to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. So I, for one, am not surprised that this is where his priorities lie. The hypocrisy and shortsightedness do not end with Donald Trump. Let us remember that many House Republicans, including both Texas Senators, opposed disaster aid following Superstorm Sandy. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, they are asking for billions of dollars in taxpayer support for their constituents. Of course, we should pass a disaster aid package quickly and without hesitation because it is simply the right thing and the American people expect us to do it. But just as we are now witnessing the sudden change of heart for disaster relief in certain Members of Congress, I hope that we will see a similar change of heart in response to the push of certain Republicans to unwind the National Flood Insurance Program. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend Louis M. Murphy, Sr., Mount Zion Progressive Missionary Baptist Church, St. Petersburg, Florida, offered the following prayer: Heavenly Father, creator of the heavens, the Earth, and of all mankind, thank You for the privilege to come before Your glorious throne, to first give praises to Your holy and righteous name, and to offer our petitions. We stand on the floor of the House of Representatives today asking for Your divine guidance and wisdom for the men and women who have been elected and sworn to represent the interests of the people of these United States of America. I pray that they would serve with humility, dignity, and honor, enacting laws that would be fair, just, and equitable. You have blessed this Nation with great wealth and great resources. Thank You. Help us to be mindful of the disenfranchised, despondent, dejected, and especially those who have been affected by Hurricane Harvey. We pray for Your protection for those in the path of Hurricane Irma. Lord God, I humbly beseech You to hear my prayer. Enable this gathering to hear and believe in the power of prayer. In Your holy name, I pray. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. WALBERG led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING REVEREND LOUIS M. MURPHY, SR. The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CRIST) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our guest chaplain, Reverend Louis M. Murphy, Sr., of my hometown of St. Petersburg, Florida. Reverend Murphy truly embodies what it means to love your neighbor as yourself. In his 18 years as senior pastor at the Mt. Zion Progressive Missionary Baptist Church, he has been a dedicated disciple of Christ, giving his time, energy, and compassion to lifting up his congregation and the larger St. Petersburg community. In addition to his duties as pastor of one of the largest churches in Pinellas County, Reverend Murphy has been a leader in economic revitalization efforts in south St. Petersburg, and in supporting job training and outreach programs for atrisk youth. A native of Florida, truly a man of God, and a man of the people. I personally thank Reverend Murphy for coming to the people’s House and providing such a moving, thoughtful invocation. God bless you. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ZELDIN ) laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to honor a Catawba County native. Mr. Greg Brunt has won more than 100 medals in the Special Olympics and serves as an inspiration to the wider Catawba community and, in my opinion, the Nation. Mr. Brunt’s road cannot have been easy. He has overcome challenges that many Americans don’t have to face. Instead of giving in, Mr. Brunt gives back. As a swimming instructor to younger students, Mr. Brunt teaches children the value of practice and perseverance. Mr. Brunt has earned many Special Olympic medals, and has aspirations of being in the Catawba County Hall of Fame. Though I am not a voting member of the board, Mr. Brunt would have my vote. Additionally, I was thrilled to learn that Mr. Brunt is a man of faith, who attends Corinth Reformed Church, and that his favorite song is ‘‘Amazing Grace.’’ When I think of the amazing accomplishments Mr. Brunt has achieved, I cannot help but think, how sweet the sound. I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr. Brunt on all of his many wins, and wish him continued success. f 
WE MUST PASS THE DREAM ACT (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, America is founded on the promise that if you work hard and play by the rules, then we will have a place for you. That is the American Dream. There is no reason it shouldn’t extend to people who were brought here as young children and have been working since then to build a better life. San Diego is home to 38,000 residents who could be eligible for DACA, the seventh most of any county in America. DREAMers are our friends, our neighbors, and our coworkers, and our economy is more prosperous because of their contributions. Like so many, I was saddened and angry at the decision by President Trump to end the DACA program. It was a cruel action, rooted in fear, that only makes us weaker. Congress must act swiftly to correct this economic and moral catastrophe. We must pass the Dream Act to protect DREAMers, and give them and their employers the certainty that they deserve. The time is right now for Congress to finally step up and do its job. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
RECOGNIZING LEACY BURKE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere gratitude and appreciation that I have the opportunity to recognize Leacy Burke, former communications director for South Carolina’s Second Congressional District. I will always appreciate Leacy for her years of service on behalf of the people of South Carolina. A native of South Carolina, Leacy is an esteemed alumna of the University of South Carolina, where she graduated with both a bachelor of arts degree in political science and criminal justice, as well as a master’s degree in mass communications, integrated communications. Beginning as a deputy press secretary for the office in 2015, it has been an honor to work with such a dedicated public servant making meaningful provisions for our office. It is with mixed feelings, but great happiness, that our office bids Leacy farewell. She is now doing amazing work in her new role as communications director for Senator JIMINHOFE , Republican, of Oklahoma. I know her parents, Greg and Denise Burke, and family members join me in recognizing her achievements. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our prayers are for all persons threatened by Hurricane Irma, from the Caribbean Islands to South Carolina. 
LET US VOTE TO RESTORE OUR VALUES AND GIVE DREAMERS OPPORTUNITIES THEY DESERVE (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, Ana was an intern in my office. She is also an undocumented immigrant. When DACA was announced, Ana was ecstatic. She told me that DACA meant she could qualify for financial aid or be an intern at the State Department. All she saw were opportunities to contribute to our country, and that is exactly what she has done. Thanks to DACA, Ana earned her master’s degree and got a job helping other immigrants to lay roots and contribute, like she did. She was able to get a driver’s license to safely get to school and work. And today, she is attending law school. Ana represents the promise that if you come here, work here, and contribute here, you will have a future here. But Donald Trump is breaking that promise by ending DACA. And so it is up to us to fix it. The bipartisan Dream Act will protect these DREAMers who are American in every way but on paper. Mr. Speaker, let us vote to restore our values and give these DREAMers the opportunities they deserve. CONGRATULATING INDIANA STATE SENATOR LUKE KENLEY (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Indiana’s State Senator Luke Kenley on his retirement, and to thank him for the many years he dedicated to serving our fellow Hoosiers. From balancing the budget to reforming State taxes, he has worked for 25 years to empower local communities and strengthen Indiana’s economy. He led important efforts to enhance our schools, roads, businesses, local institutions, and more. Senator Kenley’s commitment to Hoosier common sense, and his tireless efforts to bring our State’s economy into the 21st century, helped transform Indiana and improve Hoosiers’ lives. I am grateful for Senator Kenley’s leadership and his keen understanding of the Hoosier values that are so important to our way of life. I have no doubt his impact on our State will last far into the future. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Indiana State Senator Luke Kenley the absolute best as he embarks on this next chapter in life. f 
DACA AND PROTECTING DREAMERS (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, when DACA was launched in 2012, it allowed nearly 800,000 young people to come out of the shadows and live without the constant fear of being deported. Some came here as infants in their parents’ arms. Some know no other language but English, and they know no other country but America. And all of them simply seek a better future. DACA helped breathe life into their American Dream. DREAMers are our neighbors, our friends, and our colleagues. They grew up here. They have done absolutely nothing wrong. They are in school, they are working, and they are contributing to the American economy. And now, they must fear deportation once again. That is not the American Dream; that is not who we are. I hope that all of my colleagues will take that to heart so that we can finally pass the Dream Act and keep these Americans out of the shadows, contributing to our economy, growing their lives, and helping live and be the American Dream. 
RECOGNIZING PASTOR FRANK HAMPTON, JR. (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Frank Hampton, Jr., as he celebrates 50 years of ministry at the Church of God in Jackson, Michigan. Over the years, Pastor Hampton has been a steady example of what it means to be a father, a pastor, a mentor, and a community servant. In addition to faithfully shepherding his congregation, Pastor Hampton has served as a volunteer chaplain for Allegiance Health, counseled disadvantaged youth, and helped build strong leaders in the community. He has worked in conjunction with Jackson’s judicial system, Jackson Public Schools, Jackson County Jail, and the Interfaith Shelter. The longevity of his service to his congregation and to the community is a reflection of his mission to make a profound difference in the lives of everyone he meets. Pastor Hampton is a remarkable man of integrity, perseverance, and servant leadership. His 50 years of ministry have set the standard for our community. I congratulate him on his milestone and pray for God’s many blessings in the years ahead. f 
LET’S FIX DACA (Mr. CONNOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, President Trump shielded Sheriff Joe Arpaio from a prison sentence for criminal contempt, despite Sheriff Arpaio’s record of illegal racial profiling and abuse directed at immigrant communities. The President’s latest salvo in his war on immigrants is his tragic decision to end the DACA program, which has given nearly 800,000 innocent DREAMers, who want to be Americans, the opportunity to work and attend school. In my native State of Virginia, we have more than 12,000 DREAMers, who contribute more than $711 million to our GDP every year—that is contribute. These young, hardworking DREAMers, who see themselves as Americans, as do I, are contributing to our communities, creating jobs, serving in our military, teaching our children, and caring for our family members. President Trump would learn that if he ever sat down with them, as I have, and so many of my colleagues have, and broken bread with them, and listened to their fascinating, challenging, wonderful stories. Ending DACA is selfdefeating, hurts the American economy, and neglects all that makes America unique. Let’s fix this. 
b1215 COMMEMORATING FRANCIS BELLAMY (Mr. COLLINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Francis Bellamy, one of the most influential individuals from Mount Morris, New York. Francis Bellamy is the author of the Pledge of Allegiance. Tomorrow marks the 125th anniversary of the Pledge of Allegiance, which was first published in a magazine called The Youth’s Companion on September 8, 1892. The pledge was initially written as part of a campaign to put American flags in every school in the country. In its original form, it read: ‘‘I pledge allegiance to my flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’’ In 1923, the words, ‘‘the flag of the United States of America’’ were added. In 1954, Congress added the words, ‘‘under God,’’ creating the 31word pledge we have today. Bellamy’s words are recited millions of times every day and are ingrained in our society as an expression of national pride and patriotism. 
CONGRESS MUST PASS LEGISLATION TO PROTECT DREAMERS (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is inhumane and unAmerican. Whatever your politics on immigration, America’s DREAMers did not choose their birthplace or their path early in life. They are innocents, and they have grown up as Americans. They have attended school here alongside our own children. They share our values and our principles. They believe in the American Dream. Yes, deporting them hurts our economy, and yes, it damages our standing as a leading nation, but at its heart, this is a matter of conscience. What kind of justice will we give to kids brought here when they were 6 years old, who grew up as Americans and who have no home beyond our shores? To make them the targets of deportation is a violation of our national conscience. Congress must act now to pass legislation to protect these DREAMers. A just nation must not take lightly the judgment of the innocent. Let us not discard our friends and our neighbors for the sake of political theater, not when we can instead draw strength of heart and mind and treasure from their experience, their differences, and the many values we share in common. E pluribus unum. Out of many, we are indeed one. BRINGING ATTENTION TO MONTANA’S WILDFIRES (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the wildfires devastating Montana. My heart goes out to those affected by Hurricane Harvey. The disaster has shown the very best of our country, neighbor helping neighbor. That spirit is alive and well in Montana, too, as we face a massive disaster. Drought conditions are severe. Over 40 wildfires continue to rage, and more than 900,000 acres have burned so far. As we speak, ash rains down on our homes and our schools, poor air quality threatens the health of Montanans, particularly our children and our elderly, and our livelihoods are at risk. This photo was taken just a few weeks ago from the south summit of Mount Sentinel as fires raged towards the town of Lolo, Montana. Sadly, this image is not unique. I met with leaders and firefighters at five wildfires this summer and witnessed the destruction firsthand. Mr. Speaker, I hope this image and others from back home will make my colleagues more aware of the fires, the devastation they have caused, and the need for relief in the Treasure State. 
CONGRESS SHOULD PASS THE DREAM ACT (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the over 20,000 DREAMers in my district on the central coast of California. Due to the administration’s pledge to end DACA, those young men and women, who have done everything right after they got to America, are now being punished for a choice that they did not make before coming to America. Their mothers and fathers came to the central coast to work hard and contribute to the economies and communities in the salad bowl of the world and the most scenic place in the world so that their children could have the opportunity to live the American Dream in the best country in the world. Now, it is clear that DACA doesn’t just give them that dream. All that DACA does is give those children the opportunity to come out of the shadows and fulfill that dream. That is why DREAMers work in our businesses, study in our schools, and serve in the military of the only country that they know. This is why Congress should vote on and pass the Dream Act. If we do our job, we will allow DREAMers to not only do their jobs, we will give them the opportunity to give back to the communities and country that gave them and their parents so much. As immigrants, they understand that obligation. Let’s show them and let’s show this country that Congress understands that obligation as well. f 
RECOGNIZING CLARION UNIVERSITY’S 150TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Clarion University of Pennsylvania as it celebrates 150 years. In 1859, the people of Clarion County created a proposal for a higher education institution in Clarion. Shortly after, the Civil War erupted and disrupted the Nation, but it did not stop the determination of the Clarion people. On September 10, 1867, Clarion University was founded as the Carrier Seminary of western Pennsylvania. With no facilities to call home, Carrier Seminary operated as a coeducational program in the old academy building, with Reverend James G. Townsend as principal. Carrier Seminary then became Clarion State Normal School in 1887. In 1915, the Commonwealth purchased the school, and it became a technical school of junior college rank in 1920. It opened its doors as a collegelevel institution in 1929. Since then, Clarion’s student body has grown to more than 5,000, its programs have received top level accreditation, and the institution has become a part of Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Clarion University on reaching this milestone, and I join all in celebrating its rich history and contributions to our area. 
AMERICA CAN BE A FAIR AND COMPASSIONATE NATION (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, last week I visited Norte Vista High School and stood before a room of DREAMers who were desperate to know if they have a future in America, the only country they have ever called home. I had to look each student in the eye and say: I can’t make any promises. The question is not whether we have enough votes in Congress to pass the Dream Act. We all know that we do. The question is not whether passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do. We all know that it is. The question before this Congress is whether we have the political courage and the basic decency to reject our worst impulses, and protect the most vulnerable members of our society. In a few months, I hope I can stand before that same room of DREAMers 
and tell them that the answer is, yes; yes, America can be a fair and a compassionate nation, and, yes, they are free to realize the promise of this great country. 
TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT AARON ALLAN AND DEPUTY CHIEF JIM WATERS (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our Nation’s police officers, who sacrifice for their fellow citizens and selflessly put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. Sadly, in late July, right before our August recess, our community of central Indiana suffered terrible losses. While off duty, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Deputy Chief Jim Waters was involved in an accident involving a semitrailer. He passed away a few days later on July 27. Deputy Chief Waters held almost every title in law enforcement in his lifetime, but he was proudest of the titles of son, brother, father, and husband. No matter the job he took on, Deputy Chief Waters was known for working so hard, yet having fun while doing so. Also in late July, a second Indiana police officer was killed. When responding to an overturned vehicle on Marion County’s south side, Southport Police Department’s Lieutenant Aaron Allan was fatally shot by the driver he was trying to assist in that overturned vehicle. He, too, passed away on July 27. He was the first Southport police officer to be killed in the line of duty. As a child, Allan always knew what he wanted to be when he grew up: a police officer. He had a compassionate heart and consistently went out of his way to help those in need, even if his job didn’t require it or he was off duty. I offer my deepest condolences to their families, the Southport and Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Departments, and all who mourn their loss and cherish their memory. 
HONORING DR. ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ BILLINGSLEA (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr. Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Billingslea of Orlando, who passed away on Friday, September 1. Dr. Billingslea was the founding executive of Walt Disney’s Corporate Urban Affairs and Development department, and served as its vice president until his retirement in 2012. In this position, he led the company’s minority outreach efforts, and was a firm believer that diversity drives growth, creativity, and innovation. Bob’s unwavering commitment was evident by his service. He served on numerous organizations and boards, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Boys and Girls Clubs, and founded the Orlando Urban League, to name a few. When Bob walked into a room, people noticed; and when Bob spoke, people listened. Bob Billingslea was smart, impactful, and unforgettable. He made a difference. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing time for this tribute as we celebrate the life of Dr. Bob Billingslea. f 
HONORING MISSOURI TASK FORCE 1 FOR THEIR COURAGE AND SELFLESSNESS (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the brave members of Missouri’s Task Force 1, who have risked their lives to help others in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Missouri’s Task Force 1 is one of 28 urban search and rescue teams in the country. Its 210 members are trained to provide emergency response and disaster relief services at a moment’s notice. Last week, as the rains came down and the waters came up in Houston, 47 members of the task force deployed to Texas with a mission: to turn potential stories of tragedy and despair into stories of salvation and hope, and they succeeded. In just one day during Hurricane Harvey, the team made more than 300 water rescues and evacuations. Deployed to Houston for 14 days, these skilled crewmembers risked their lives to save the lives of others in Houston. Now they are monitoring a possible new deployment to assist after Hurricane Irma. We should all keep in mind the contributions and rescue efforts of Task Force 1. Their courage and selflessness demonstrated the best of humanity in the worst of times. I want to thank them for putting their lives on the line to help others in their time of need. You are all worthy of our respect, appreciation, and honor. 
b1230 CONGRESS MUST FIX OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Congress must act to fix our broken immigration system, including passing legislation to protect DREAMers. Like many Members of this body, I was deeply disappointed with the President’s decision regarding DACA, to take away the promise of possibility that DACA provided young people who were brought to this country as children—many of them just months old— by their parents and have grown up here. They work here. They go to school here. They contribute to the quality, to the greatness of this country. The one thing I did believe is right that the President said was that Congress ought to act. I have sat here and watched us name post offices, bring back legislation that we have passed in previous Congresses on suspension and brought them to the floor and debated them for hours. We have time in this House to stand up for 800,000 young people and give them hope that they deserve, to show that this country is as great as we say it is. When the Speaker was elected, he said he would open up the process. Here is my challenge: Bring the Dream Act to the floor of the House of Representatives. If you believe these DREAMers should be deported, then vote ‘‘no,’’ but give them a vote on the floor of this House. That is the moral thing to do, and we should do it now. f 
KEEP OUR GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONING EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act that the House is considering. This bill is a package of legislation that the Appropriations Committee has diligently worked on over the last several months that will fund our domestic and national security priorities. This is legislation that prioritizes conservative policies, invests in proven and effective programs, and reduces unnecessary and wasteful spending. It will fund the government in a fiscally responsible way, keeping a lid on spending as we have since taking the House majority in 2010. It will continue our work of rolling back burdensome, jobkilling policies to help our economy grow even faster than we have seen over the last 7 months when we have added more than 1 million jobs. It includes many items that the House has already passed this summer, like the largest pay raise for our troops in 8 years and the most funding to care for our veterans in our Nation’s history. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure to keep our government functioning efficiently and effectively for the American people. 
CULTURE OF CORRUPTION AT WELLS FARGO (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, Wells Fargo is the Nation’s third largest bank, with nearly $2 trillion in assets. In the past several 
months, Wells Fargo has engaged in blatant and systemic fraud perpetrated against millions of its own customers by opening feegenerating accounts without customer authorization, changing mortgage terms without customer knowledge, and forcing Wells Fargo auto loan customers into costly insurance products they did not need or want. Mr. Speaker, Wells Fargo has demonstrated a blatant, egregious culture of corruption, costing their customers tens of millions of dollars in unauthorized fees and financial hardship. Today I am calling on the Federal Housing Administration to ban, to immediately declare ineligible, Wells Fargo from participation in the Federal mortgage guarantee program. Wells Fargo has violated its public trust and that of millions of its own customers and clients. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF FORMER CONGRESSMAN VERN EHLERS (Mr. AMASH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, with great sadness, the people of west Michigan learned of the recent passing of former Congressman Vern Ehlers. Vern was a humble man who served our community with honor. Early in his life, Vern moved to Grand Rapids to attend Calvin College. After earning his Ph.D. at Berkeley, he returned to help launch, and later chair, Calvin’s Physics Department. His passion for science, technology, and the environment came to define his time at Calvin and tenure in Congress. In 1993, Vern was elected to Congress and served until his retirement in 2010. Vern was the first research physicist in Congress, and his impressive background contributed to his many achievements. Vern was a member of the Committees on Education and the Workforce; Science, Space, and Technology; and Transportation and Infrastructure. He served as chairman of the Committee on House Administration, and his portrait now hangs in the committee’s main hearing room. I have staff who worked for Vern, and they all admired his compassion, independent thinking, and nonpartisan record. Colleagues often referred to him as ‘‘the smartest man in Congress.’’ Vern lived as commanded in Micah 6:8: ‘‘To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with Your God.’’ He placed his hands on this verse each time he was sworn in. Our community will endeavor always to honor his legacy. My deepest condolences go out to Vern’s wife, Johanna, his children and grandchildren, and to everyone whose lives he touched. May his memory be eternal. SUPPORT THE DREAMERS (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of DREAMers. When I was just a baby, my parents brought me to this country because they sought freedom, opportunity, and a better life for our family. As a parent now, I know how they must have felt because I, too, would do anything for my children, no matter the risk. That parental instinct to give our children better opportunities than we had is universal and powerful. DREAMers were brought to this country as children by families who sought a better life. They were just kids and had no role in the decision to leave their native country, and they have done nothing wrong. They demonstrate one of our Nation’s most basic promises: the American Dream is available to anyone who is willing to work for it. The President’s decision this week to end DACA will tear families apart. Worse yet, it punishes children who have done nothing to deserve punishment. It is immoral and wrong. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you bring the Dream Act to the floor so we can enact an enduring solution for the 800,000 aspiring Americans who would be hurt by the President’s decision. 
AMERICAN FAMILIES DESERVE ATTENTION AND SUPPORT (Mr. ROHRABACHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about DREAMers today, and we will continue to hear that. Let us note that we are talking about inviting millions of people to send their children to the United States, millions from around this hemisphere who live in poverty and oppression, and we are saying: If you can get your kids to the United States, they are going to be taken care of. We have limited resources here, limited in the Federal Government. Our people of every race and every religion and every ethnic group that make up the American family deserve to know that we are caring about them—I am sorry—rather than the children in other countries that come here illegally. We can expect a flood of new young people if we legalize this, and they will be consuming the healthcare dollars. They will be consuming the education dollars that should go to American children. This is not being selfish by saying take care of your family first. The American family deserves our attention and our support. We should not be extracting resources, bidding down their wages, extracting the resources of education and healthcare for people who have come here illegally and invite more people to flood into our country. No, the DREAMers concept is a nightmare for American young people. f 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF JAMES ANDREWS (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor James Andrews, president of the North Carolina AFL–CIO. After four decades of service, James will be retiring on September 15. He has been a leader since a young age, and while serving our country in Vietnam, he earned a Purple Heart for his brave service. Upon his return, James organized fellow workers at a plant in Henderson, North Carolina, before joining the AFL–CIO in 1974 as a director of Frontlash, an AFL–CIO youth group. Just a year later, the AFL–CIO recognized James’ dedication to the fight for fair working conditions and promoted him to outreach director for the North Carolina federation, making him the first African American to hold a paid, fulltime staff position with the State AFL–CIO federation. After a brief stint working for his union in 1982, he began his position as the treasurer and secretary for North Carolina’s AFL–CIO. A little over a decade later, James was elected as president and became the first African American to lead a State federation. As his service draws to a close, we want to both congratulate and honor him for his unparalleled work on behalf of North Carolina’s hardworking families. James, congratulations, and thank you for your hard work. 
COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF KENDRA MURRAY ADAMS (Ms. MOORE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life of Mrs. Kendra Murray Adams, a loving mother, a wife, daughter, sister, and friend to many, myself included. I first got to know Kendra when she joined my office in 2005 as an executive assistant. She was a blonde bombshell who was quickwitted, strongwilled, but just as quick to laugh with you and at you, if needed. Effortlessly funny and graciously caring, it was a joy to get to know her and to have a front row seat to see how this marvelous young lady lived life. Even now, I struggle to find the words to convey how much of a joy and honor it was to know Kendra and to be known by Kendra. Whether you knew her for years, or just got to meet her, you got the best 
of her from minute one. Kendra may have left my office, but she never left my heart. Sadly, at the end of July, Kendra lost her battle with cancer at the tender age of 39. And although my heart is heavy, I am recalling the final words written by Kendra before her death, where she urged those who loved her to not mourn, but to ‘‘live life, to go to the beach, go rock climbing, skydiving, do what you want to do.’’ This exemplifies her spirit, her courage, and her life which, unfortunately, ended too soon. Kendra is survived by her beloved twins, her husband, her father, her sister, and my thoughts and prayers are with her and her family and friends. I loved her dearly, and I will miss her deeply and will always remember her. 
PROTECTING DACA (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 800,000 DREAMers in our Nation, 200,000 in my State of California. Now, these DREAMers are students, entrepreneurs, volunteers, and neighbors. They go to school, they work, and they pay taxes. They are young men and women like my constituent, Karem, a DREAMer who recently graduated from the University of California at Berkeley. Karem now works as a paralegal, helping people like herself navigate our complicated immigration system. Karem came to America when she was only 3 years old. In a message to my office, she wrote: ‘‘The United States is all I’ve ever known.’’ I have to tell you, she is as American as I am. Forcing Karem or any hardworking DREAMer out of this country or back into the shadows is heartless and unAmerican. This is her home. Deporting DREAMers from the only country they have ever known is an extreme betrayal of our values. We care about family values. Ending DACA breaks families up. Let me be clear: Now President Trump has turned his back on these innocent young people. Now it is up to Congress to have the courage to do the right thing. I call on Speaker RYANto bring up the bipartisan and bicameral Dream Act now. 
PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3354, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 504 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGHTER ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. b1245 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, it is going to be a good day. It is going to be a good day. I don’t know if you came down to Washington as a young man. I remember sitting right up there on the second row of the gallery, and I came into the Chamber and I was so excited. It was my first visit to see the people’s House. The Reading Clerk was standing there at that podium and read and read. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, and here nobody hands you a pamphlet or anything to tell you what is happening on the floor of the House. I thought the activity was going to happen down here, and it was all going on up there at the podium. That has been 40 years ago now. I now see that however long that conversation happens, it lays the groundwork for what is going to be an even greater conversation here on the floor of the House. Mr. Speaker, I am fond of saying that if you come to this institution on the right day, you are going to see a festival of democracy take place right here. Today is going to be one of those days. If you were on the House floor yesterday, you saw us take up the first of these divisions in this appropriations bill. Today, because of the work that my friend from New York and I did with the rest of the members of the Rules Committee right up there last night, we are bringing to the floor the remaining four divisions of H.R. 3354; 224 additional amendments. 224 additional amendments. Division A is the Interior section; division C is the Commerce, Justice, Science section; division D is the Financial Services section; division F is the Labor, HHS, and Education section. When I was on the floor yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I talked about how proud I was of the work that we have all done here together. This annual appropriations process has been conducted in a more comprehensive fashion this year than in any other year in my memory. When we get jammed, you end up with one of those longterm, yearlong continuing resolutions that shut out every Member’s voice. In a good year, maybe, you end up with one of those giant leadershipnegotiated White House and the leader of the House and the Senate omnibus appropriations bills that shut out all but two or three voices. This year, the Appropriations Committee, beginning its work way back in April, has worked through every single appropriations bill one by one at the committee level, and we are seeing the culmination of that effort here on the floor today. Mr. Speaker, it has been since 2010 that the House has finished its work before the September 30 fiscal year deadline. It was the 2009 calendar year. They were doing the work for the 2010 fiscal year. It is hard to get this done, and it doesn’t happen because Democrats are successful or Republicans are 
successful. It happens because the collaboration that we have together is successful, and we are seeing the result of that today. If we pass the underlying rule, we will make in order those 224 amendments, we will begin that process of debating the last four divisions, and we will have the voices of this House heard. We went until midnight last night, Mr. Speaker. We went until midnight the night before that. I suspect midnight is going to seem early to us where we are headed over the next couple of days. But at the end of that process, Republicans, Democrats, folks from all regions of the country, are going to be able to look each other in the eye and know that—in a way that makes folks back home proud—we worked through each and every appropriations bill and we got our work done on time. That is why I ran for Congress, Mr. Speaker, to deliver results back home, and that is why I am proud to be standing with my friend from New York today delivering on those promises. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, what is happening with the appropriations bills is unprecedented. After passing four appropriations bills earlier this year, we are now considering the remaining eight appropriations bills this week in 2 days. That means that we are debating the funding for roughly twothirds of discretionary Federal spending bills in just over 4 days. Has any Member here really had the time to read all 1,035 pages of these eight bills? Better yet, has anyone had time to read nearly all the thousand amendments and determine what the impact of each one would be? This is the appropriations process we are talking about; the process that used to take us days and weeks and was perfectly open so that all Members of the House were able to propose amendments on the floor. These are the bills that fund programs that impact the life of every American every single day. But we are not giving them any serious consideration they deserve, and the minority has been virtually, literally, I would say, shut out of the process altogether. When the majority took control of Congress and the White House, they promised regular order. They have not only broken that promise, they have shattered it and stomped on it. Speaker RYANis the only speaker in the history of tracking statistics to never have had a truly open rule. An open rule would allow any Member to offer an amendment that complies with the standing rules of the House and the Budget Act. Not a single one. A bad process, I believe, will lead to a bad product, and these bills are no exception. They are full of provisions that would do real harm to millions of Americans. Inside these bills, the DoddFrank financial reform law, passed in the wake of the biggest recession since the Great Depression, would be tattered. The biggest banks still in control of the people who got us in trouble in the first place would be allowed to run roughshod over the economy again, paving the way for another Great Recession or worse. Try as we could to find out what would be the substitute for DoddFrank to prevent them from doing that again, there is no answer they would be able to do it. Under DoddFrank, we have had a recordsetting streak of more than 80 consecutive months of private sector job growth. Mr. Speaker, this growth didn’t come despite this law; it came because of it. There is also language here that would ramp up the majority’s assault on women’s health; provisions that would zero out funding for Title X, the Nation’s only Federal program devoted to family planning. More than 4 million women depend on it for access to contraception. The bills would also eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, which serves 2.5 million women and men every year. It is relied on not just for contraception, but for services like breast cancer screenings, wellness visits, and STI testing. The bills would be truly destructive if they ever became law. They don’t appear to have the necessary votes to pass the Senate, since there are not 60 Senators willing to vote for this legislation, and that would make one wonder why are we even going through this charade, because we have only 9 legislative days left in the month of September. During those 9 days, we need to raise the debt ceiling to pay the bills we have already incurred, to fund the government for the following year, to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program; the Perkins Loan Program, which many lowincome students rely on for their college education; and, very importantly, the Federal Aviation Administration. All of those expire on September 30. We also need to address the National Flood Insurance Program, which, on its current course, faces a shortfall of more than $25 billion. And that will expire at the end of this month. We all know the horror of going through Hurricane Harvey, and now Irma, and with two more, as I understand it, starting their aim at us in the Atlantic. If we are going to do all of this, we have to get back to the orderly and thoughtful process. Congress can’t wait for a disaster to always be at its doorstep before acting. We need to abandon legislation by chaos or emergency, which we often do for something that we could have done by scheduling. Twothirds of the discretionary spending bills considered in a single week is absurd and irresponsible, and I would doubt has ever taken place before in the House of Representatives. It is time we took control of the House and got back to regular order, which we talk about all the time, but hardly anybody remembers. We hope for a better day, and we hope for it soon. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My friend is absolutely right, there is a lot of work to get done. That is why we both ran for Congress, to get that work done. I am incredibly optimistic that we will get that work done. I wish from time to time we would celebrate our successes as fiercely as we observe our failures. My friend is absolutely right, there was a time in congressional history where appropriations bills came to the floor and any Member could offer any amendment they wanted at any time, and the process could go on for days or weeks or months. To my friend’s point, we can reminisce about those days and celebrate them, but we can’t do it at the same time we observe the very limited deadlines that we have now trying to get work done. It was back on August 24 that the Rules Committee created a deadline and said: We want to have every Member have their voice heard. We want to hear from every single Member on every single appropriations bill to understand what it is you would do differently to have the bills serve America better. We created that deadline, Mr. Speaker, for exactly the reason my friend from New York suggested, and that is so folks would have the time to look at those amendments, to digest those amendments, to be thoughtful about those amendments. Now, it turns out even in a body of 435 Members, you can have some repetitive ideas. It turns out a lot of us think a single amendment is a good idea. The Rules Committee looked at amendments and found multiple Members had exactly the same idea. In order to speed the process along, we let one of those Members offer the amendment; we asked the other Members not to. That is not closing down the process. That is a good use of the American people’s time, because we have so much that we must get done together. Mr. Speaker, for folks who care about openness—and I am one of those Members—I just want to remind you that it is not just the 1,000plus amendments we looked at in the Rules Committee. It is thousands upon thousands that were worked through the Appropriations Subcommittee process, and then the Appropriations full committee process. b1300 The appropriations process is one of the best opportunities for any Member 
in this Chamber to make their priorities known, act on those priorities, change the law of the land for the men and women they serve back home. Every single Member of this Chamber knows of that process, avails themselves of that process, and if we pass this rule, we will make several hundred more amendments in order and complete this process for the first time since 2009. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. ROSEN ). Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am disgusted by House Republicans’ continued efforts to end DACA and help this heartless administration tear families apart. Yesterday, House Republicans had a chance to rectify the Trump Administration’s despicable decision to betray DREAMers in Nevada and across this country. Instead, they chose to block the immediate consideration of the bipartisan Dream Act. And then last night, House Republicans in the Rules Committee doubled down on this President’s cowardly assault on DREAMers by blocking an amendment that I helped file with my colleagues JULIA BROWNLEY  and LUISCORREA . That would have prohibited funds from being used to deport DACA recipients. In Nevada, DACA has allowed more than 13,000 young people to come forward, pass background checks, and live and work legally. These young men and women who are brought here as children are patriotic and brave. They include college students, members of our military, and so many others who are contributing to our society. They fear they will be taken from their homes and their families torn apart. President Trump’s decision to end DACA is an affront to everything our Nation stands for and only cements his legacy of shortsighted cruelty. House Republicans ought to be ashamed of themselves for helping this administration push DREAMers one step closer to deportation. I will continue to fight for our values, our principles, because as Americans, we do not turn our backs on people who represent the best of our Nation. We must take the Dream Act up without delay. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PALMER ). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ), one of our leaders from the great State of California. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank you very much for providing me this time. I rise in opposition to this rule, which prohibits a vote of the House of Representatives on an amendment that would prevent the Department of Justice from using its power and resources to supersede all State laws that have legalized the medical use of cannabis. For 3 years, States have been shielded from having the will of their voters and their people by a prohibition on the Department of Justice that would prevent the Department of Justice from thwarting the will of the people of the States by superceding those State laws when they have determined in the States that the medical use of marijuana should be permitted with their citizens. The Rules Committee has, thus, been basically—it will be changing the law of the land for 3 years where the 50 States have been permitted, if they so chose, to have the medical use of marijuana. After this vote, because of this rule, we have been prevented from again providing that prohibition that passed this House on a number of occasions that would prohibit the Department of Justice from superceding State law. In short, a vote for this rule is anti States’ rights. A vote for this rule is against permitting the people of your State to legalize the medical use of marijuana if the Federal Government, if the DOJ, decides. A vote for this rule will, thus, prevent medical use of cannabis by our doctors in States that would like to permit their people to benefit from illegal use of medical marijuana. Instead, those doctors now will, as they have been, prescribing opiates. That is right, opiates. Our people have ended up being prescribed opiates because marijuana has not been an option. It is a vote to cut off our veterans, and our seniors with arthritis, those people who have children who are plagued with seizures, all of these things now are permitted in the States where they have legalized the medical use of marijuana. These people are provided an avenue to at least try this as a method of dealing with these horrible maladies that they have to deal with in their lives, whether they are seizures, or whether they are people who have arthritis, or whether they are our veterans who are coming back. We need to make sure that the billions of dollars that right now are being invested in medical marijuana businesses and clinics throughout our country, those billions of dollars will go to the benefit of our people. Instead, this rule prevents us from standing in the way of the Justice Department from obliterating those rights in the States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WOODALL. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from California. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, so a vote against this rule is a vote to permit those States to make that decision. The rule, as it is now, prevents us from getting in the way of the Justice Department’s obliteration of these rights. But one of the most important things, whether it is States’ rights, or whether it is trying to listen to the seniors who are begging for us to give them some relief from some of their suffering and let them at least try this if the doctors so prescribe, but let us just remember this: that billions of dollars, $3 billion or $4 billion have been invested in this industry to provide honest businessmen and doctors the right to try medical marijuana on some of these maladies. Those $3 billion will immediately be transferred to the drug cartels in Mexico if this rule goes through. That is what it means. Now, I would suggest that whether it is opiates, or the drug lords down in Mexico, we need to side with the States’ rights to make this determination and decide—and to make our determination to let the people decide in those States and let them have the choice there. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule for those reasons. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act, this bipartisan, bicameral legislation. We have thousands of young people who are Americans in every way except on paper. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ) to discuss our proposal. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, in the past 5 years, the DACA program has given nearly 800,000 young men and women who came here as children, and have only known the United States as their home, a shot at the American Dream. It rightfully allowed them to come forward to live, work, and learn in the United States legally, and without fear of deportation. President Trump, this week, made his most heartless decision yesterday by cruelly rescinding DACA protection for these young DREAMers. These DREAMers now face the painful reality of a President betraying their trust, forcing them back into the shadows, and kicking them out of their homes. These kids put their faith in our government to protect them. They underwent rigorous background checks and paid the required fees, all for an opportunity to better themselves and their communities. And we are failing them. I share a similar story as many of these DREAMers. I emigrated to the United States with my parents as a 5 yearold boy from Mexico. This great country since has given me the opportunity to work hard, raise my two children, and serve my country in local 
government, the military, and here in Congress. Terminating DACA and stripping DREAMers of that same hope and opportunity is unconscionable and incompatible with our American values. We are a nation of immigrants and are made stronger by their contributions. Following the President’s shameful decision this week, Congress must take action and pass the bipartisan Dream Act which would provide a permanent legislative solution to allow DREAMers to remain in the United States and continue to contribute to our Nation’s future. They are our neighbors, our children’s classmates, our coworkers. These are all hardworking and law abiding individuals. We cannot afford to abandon DACA recipients who have lived in America all of their lives and contribute to this country in many ways. Ending this program undermines our economic growth and competitiveness, costing our economy $490 billion in lost GDP over the next decade, in addition to losing potential innovation and entrepreneurship. This House has already passed the DREAM Act in 2010, and a majority of Senators also supported this legislation. However, it fell short with a filibuster from thenSenator Jeff Sessions, the same Attorney General who announced the termination of DACA this week. This Congress must now ensure the wellbeing and future of these 800,000 youth living and working in the United States. I urge my colleagues to stand up for DREAMers by bringing H.R. 3440, the bipartisan Dream Act, immediately to the floor for a vote. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that admonition. As my friends all know, the truth is, the vote in the Senate was a bipartisan vote against the consideration of that bill. We are going to find a bipartisan solution to this difficult problem and continuing to characterize this as a partisan issue does nothing but harm to our shared cause. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY), one of the great leaders of the big freshman class in 2010. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, and I encourage my colleagues to support this rule. As a prolife conservative, I have long fought to make sure that taxpayers’ dollars aren’t being used to fund abortions or to fund abortion providers. Whether it is in the Appropriations Committee or here on the House floor, I have repeatedly made the cause for increasing protections for life under the law. Those fights haven’t always been easy, and we haven’t won every time. But Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the appropriations bill before us does contain important prolife provisions. First, the bill states: ‘‘None of the funds made available by this act may be used to conduct or support research using human fetal tissue if such tissue is obtained pursuant to an induced abortion.’’ We all remember the 2015 scandal that revealed how Planned Parenthood officials were systematically altering abortion procedures in order to preserve the organs of babies to sell them to researchers. I said it at that time, and you don’t have to be staunchly pro life like me to be appalled by the thought of harvesting and trafficking aborted babies’ body parts for profit. Our bill will prevent these atrocities from removing any incentives abortion providers might have to harvest and sell babies’ organs. Instead, the bill directs agencies to find research using modern, more efficient alternatives to human fetal tissue. To be clear, I am a strong supporter of the National Institutes of Health. Their research is critical for development of lifesaving medical breakthroughs. However, I believe we must set a clear line of distinction between what is acceptable and what is not. Second, the bill expressly prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from steering Title X public health funding to abortion providers. Of course, the Hyde amendment has long made it against the law to actually pay for abortions with taxpayer dollars. But the Obama administration had a bad habit of pushing hundreds of millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood in forms of grants and reimbursements for other services. This amounts to a pipeline of funding propping up the Nation’s largest abortion provider. It is an abuse of taxpayer money, and I am pleased that this bill cuts it off. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my chairman, TOMCOLE, for including these important prolife provisions in our base bill for the first time. b1315 It represents real progress for the prolife movement, and I will continue to fight to see it through the process. Mr. Speaker, I am unapologetically prolife, and I believe that every human life is precious and our laws and policies should reflect that. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), a distinguished member of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank our ranking member for yielding and, really, for her tireless advocacy on behalf of all Americans. I rise in strong opposition to this rule and the underlying bill, the so called Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act. Mr. Speaker, let’s make one thing clear: this bill breaks Republicans’ promise to get back to regular order, while blocking the majority of amendments to be considered on the floor. Also, as an AfricanAmerican woman, I can’t help but see how these cuts impact communities of color. It may be easy to think of budgets in terms of dollar signs and decimal points, but the disturbing truth is that the decisions we make here affect lives. If we are honest, many of these decisions in this bill disproportionately affect Black and Brown lives. For instance, the bill eliminates the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative, the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Communities Health Program—just eliminates it—and Title X family planning, which many women of color and men rely on. It eliminates the Health and Career Opportunities Program, which provides training and grants for health careers for minorityserving institutions, and it eliminates the Minority AIDS Initiative, just to name a few. These are just under the Health and Human Services provision. This bill cuts $3 billion from the Pell Grant Surplus Program, $190 million in 21st Century Community Schools, and eliminates the comprehensive literacy program. All of these are critical education programs that predominantly help people and students of color. I am also disappointed that this bill divests in our workforce, especially for communities of color, by eliminating the proven apprenticeship programs and cutting millions of our Nation’s job training programs, including reintegration of exoffenders—again, majority AfricanAmerican and Latino ex offenders—reentering into society. This budget cuts millions from that. It refuses to make in order Congressman BOBBY SCOTT’s amendment to strike the prohibition against using Federal funds for transportation to desegregate public schools. We are talking, still, about desegregating public schools in 2017. What is worse, I offered an amendment in Rules to combat these devastating cuts to communities of color, and Republicans refused to make them in order. I offered an amendment that would have prohibited funds from being used to implement the policy memo that Attorney General Sessions has presented that rolls back the failed War on Drugs and reinstates the harshest sentences for lowlevel drug offenses, the majority of whom—guess what—are African Americans. I offered another amendment that would have expressed the sense of Congress that raceconscious admissions policies, which are designed to achieve a more diverse student body, which allows for the use of race as one factor, only one factor, in admissions—these policies, we have to remember, are beneficial to all students. So the Department of Justice should not take action to limit these benefits. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York has 16 minutes remaining. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 1 minute. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding another minute. Mr. Speaker, we should not be trying to limit students of color access to education, which the Justice Department is trying to do. Affirmative action is critical to mitigating discriminatory practices that prevent students of color from being admitted into the schools of their choice. Attorney General Sessions needs to back off of this. I tried to do this through an amendment to send that message. Of course, that amendment was not made in order. Congress can help, though, renew their faith in minority communities, and the minority communities can renew their faith in Congress by not accepting this Trump agenda and support clear policies that demonstrate to people of color that our lives also matter in America. Unfortunately, this spending bill does just the opposite. So I hope the Members will understand the message that we are sending to communities of color. I just mentioned a few of the cuts that have been put into this bill. I hope that we work to rectify the problems with it. It is past time to get back to regular order. It is past time to move each bill individually, also. It is past time to make strong investments in the American people, which include people of color. It is past time to help grow the economy and to create goodpaying jobs for everyone. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule and ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill. There is simply too much at stake. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself with the comments of my friend from California. She is absolutely right. When Republicans took control of this Chamber, they committed themselves to having a more open process. I was a part of that freshman class that came in to give Republicans a majority, and we have made good on that process. I want to talk about that just for a little bit. My friend from California serves on the Appropriations Committee, and I thank her for her service, Mr. Speaker. When you want to talk about an open process, that Appropriations Committee went through every single bill one subcommittee at a time, hour after hour, day after day, week after week, indeed, month after month. I am grateful to her for that service. The bill would not be as good as it is but for the men and women who serve on the Appropriations Committee. But I mentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker, that one of the reasons I was proud to be carrying the rule today is that we haven’t gotten the appropriations process completed on time since Democratic leadership was able to achieve that back in 2009. They couldn’t do it in their last year in power, 2010. In fact, they didn’t do the appropriations bills at all. They punted it off to the next Republican Congress. But in 2009 they did. When I talk about that commitment to openness, let’s remember, last time we had this shared success together and my friends on the other side of the aisle were leading, they allowed 17 amendments to the Financial Services bill. We are allowing twice that many today. When my friends were leading this institution the last time we completed this process, they allowed 13 amendments to the Interior bill. We are allowing six times that many. When my friends on the other side of the aisle were leading this institution, the last time we successfully completed this process, they allowed five amendments to the LaborHHS. We are allowing 10 times that many. When my friends on the other side of the aisle were leading this institution, the last time we successfully completed this process on time, they allowed zero amendments to the CommerceJusticeScience bill. We allow 49—infinitely more. My friends, can we always do better together? We can. I am grateful to my friends for the hard work they put in showing up day after day to do that better. But this bill is better, and if we pass this rule, we will move to the debate on this bill, and we will complete this process on time in the most open fashion that any of my colleagues have seen in decades. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. I am really very fond of my colleague over there, and I appreciate his wonderful sunshine attitude. The fact is we have never seen anything like what we are going through now. Twice, in just the last few months, one amendment by Ms. LEE, to finally get an AUMF so that we could authorize the wars that seem to be going on forever in the name of the United States of America was voted on in committee, passed in committee, and should have been in the bill. Lo and behold, it disappeared. I don’t think we ever did anything like that to my knowledge, and if we did, shame on us. In this very bill today, there was, again, an amendment presented in committee for the DACA people to be able to get jobs while they are waiting with the Federal Government. I am paraphrasing that because I never saw it, but that is my understanding of what that did. Once again, it was presented at the committee, voted, passed, and should have been in this bill. But before it got to Rules, just like Ms. LEE’s amendment, it just disappeared. How can you run the Government of the United States by saying that the people do their will through us? We are not sitting here to represent ourselves and do what we want to do and take one from column A and one from column B. We follow rules. That is what we are supposed to do. We have to answer for that. I want the people of the United States to know that what we are talking about here today is probably not going anywhere. As far as we know, it will not get past the Senate. Now, some miracle may happen. Who knows? Or maybe the whole thing will disappear—I don’t know—with no explanation, by the way. But we haven’t really done anything here yet except what I would call a crazy amalgamation of what the rules of the House wouldn’t even come close to allowing us to do. Any body, any Congress, any House of Representatives, any legislature anywhere can do what they have to do to get their budget ready if they throw it all in one mix and let one committee, the Appropriations Committee, do it. The other committees had no right to talk about it. As I pointed out, again, the majority has really cut out the minority completely. Do you think we knew before it got to Rules that those two amendments that I talked about that were terribly important had disappeared? We didn’t know that until it was given to us. Many times what we get at Rules are emergency meetings, which means one thing: no committee action. We have decided we would like to do this one this week, so let’s call it an emergency. Enough. Enough already. This is the premier legislative body in the world. The hopes, the dreams, and the aspirations of all Americans lie in this House. We do or we do not do what is in the best interests of the people who sent us here. I promise you it is not in the best interests to cut out all of the population of the United States—about half, almost half. In fact, I believe numerically we got more votes than the other side—just cut us out of the process. I have already talked about no open rules. If you can’t have an open rule whereby you can talk about amendments, there is nothing else for you to do. We are out of it because Democrats get very few amendments. I don’t think the Rules Committee people get hardly any at all, and then we beg for some of the best ones we would like to be made into order—never happens. We are pretty discouraged. As a matter of fact, we were talking about maybe we should stage a coup, but I know that is illegal and would not work in the United States of America. So it was kind of a fleeting thought brought about by pure frustration. Mr. Speaker, Mr. SCOTT had a wonderful amendment. He is the ranking member on the Education and the Workforce Committee and is known throughout the United States for the 
work that he does, as is B ARBARA LEE, who is probably more well known than almost any other Member of this House. To be treated that way, to have to go back to her district and say, ‘‘Well, we tried to do these amendments’’—enough already. We can do it the right way. We used to. When I got here, it was entirely different. The bipartisanship was strong. We all liked each other. It was a pretty wonderful thing. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), whose amendments should have been allowed. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the number of amendments that were made in order by the Rules Committee, but I am appalled that the majority chose not to include one of my amendments, No. 63, to division F of H.R. 3354, which would strike a prohibition against using Federal funds for the purpose of transportation needed to desegregate public schools. This language has found its way into every appropriations act since at least 1974. The language in sections 301 and 302 of division F of the bill really represent a relic of an ugly history when States and school districts across the Nation resisted meaningful integration of public education for decades after the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. That resistance has worked. According to the GAO last year, our schools are more segregated by race and class today than they were in 1968. The persistence of these riders, if unchallenged, is morally reprehensible and has no place in 2017. I stand with the Congressional Black Caucus in calling for a total removal of this offensive language in any fiscal 2018 appropriations act. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We have a long and proud history in this House, but it is sometimes tough to remember exactly how that history goes, Mr. Speaker. b1330 My friend from New York has her picture up on the wall in the Rules Committee room. If you haven’t been up there, Mr. Speaker, you should go see it. My friend from New York is the first woman to have ever led the United States House of Representatives Rules Committee. She led it ably and proudly for the 4 years that the Democrats were in the majority the last decade. It is a hard job because, as the chairman of the Rules Committee or the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, you have to make decisions. When the bills come to you from the committees of jurisdiction—the authorizing committees—you often have to completely reorganize those bills. You have to meld those bills together. It is a powerful committee because it has a solemn responsibility. Yes, in the area of Rules Committee jurisdiction and the melding of all of those pieces of legislation is what amendments get added and what amendments get taken away. My friend from California (Ms. LEE), has an absolutely legitimate gripe, as does my friend from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). Mr. Speaker, we all think our amendments are the greatest amendments to be known. Mr. SCOTT led, to his credit, with saying: I am glad so many of my amendments were made in order, but I am appalled my one amendment was kept out. We all want all of our amendments in. But to my friend from New York’s comment that Democrats don’t get a fair shake, I will remind you, Mr. Speaker, when my friend was leading the committee, the entire House of Representatives was offered 139 chances to change the appropriations bill in 2009, the last time we completed it. With PAULRYANleading the institution, with my friend from Texas, Pete Sessions, leading the Rules Committee, we made 214 Democratic amendments in order. We have made more minority amendments in order in this process than my friends on the other side made in order for the entire House. Mr. Speaker, we have nothing to fear from openness. We have nothing to fear from a robust debate. I am so glad that we have had a chance to do that. But history should be reported accurately. The accuracy is: we can always do better. But we are doing better today than we were just a few short years ago. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we are really getting somewhere here. What my colleague failed to say is, as far as I know and I imagine as far as he knows, that no committee has ever sent a bill to the Rules Committee completely taking away amendments that had passed in that committee and were legitimately a part of that bill. In just the last, let’s say, 2 or 3 months, two amendments legitimately passed by Democratic members in the proper committee disappeared between that committee and the Rules Committee. If that is not a violation of rules, I don’t know how in the world you would ever describe it. Sure, we had a lot of open rules—I mentioned PAUL RYAN has never had one—which gave everybody an opportunity to do an amendment, all 435 us, if we chose to, but we don’t. When you talk about something coming to us from a committee, large bills sometimes don’t come to us from committees, but oftentimes they are written somewhere—we are not sure where— but they come to us in an emergency procedure because they have to get to the floor that week. I am not just talking about improving. I am talking about following the rules of procedure laid down by history, by circumstance, and by geniuses. I am talking about not appropriating those in ways that say: We just don’t want that amendment on the list. Pretend it never happened. Throw it in the garbage and maybe nobody will remember it. We remember. We think that some amendments are a few things that would really move the country forward, and we don’t have a chance to get them put in place simply because we are the minority. That is absolutely wrong. It is undemocratic. It is hurtful to the institution and hurtful to America. We can do better. You and I should pledge right now to work on that. I am game if you are. Mr. WOODALL. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. WOODALL. I will say to my friend that I have no better days than the days that you and I are working together. I absolutely look forward to that. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Reclaiming my time, I don’t want to see that anymore. It is an embarrassment when I have to even get up to do my half of the rule and talk about what awful things have happened to us. There are more things that I need to talk about than that. I think we should cut out the games and the cuteness and all the rest of it and do our job. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ). Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today, as a Member of the United States House of Representatives, embarrassed. At the same time that I am embarrassed, I am also dumbfounded. I know that there are people at home that are thinking: Why would a Member of Congress, the most prestigious body in the world, be embarrassed, dumbfounded? Well, I was always taught that if you show me your budget or if you show me your legislation, then you are showing me your values. Representative SCOTT, my good friend from Virginia, had an amendment that would strike the prohibition that Federal funds could be used to desegregate our public schools in this country. If you look at the GAO study, there are more schools now that are desegregated than in 1968. We can talk eloquently about the history of the House and what the Democrats did when they were in control and how many amendments were made in order. I am not talking about how many amendments. I am talking about a specific amendment, a specific issue. We are perpetuating segregation in the United States of America in our 
public schools. We are not allowing the States to use funds to promote integration and diversity among our schools. My State—and I will own this—is still the only State under a Federal desegregation order, because we have not completely desegregated our schools. We still have that ugly history. With everything going on in this country and school kids probably huddled around a TV right now watching this institution work and they are saying: These are our leaders? We elected them to run this country? Why wouldn’t they want me to go to school with other kids of other races? That is why I am embarrassed. It is wrong. I don’t think we should just hide behind procedure, but address the issue and the moral failure and the message that we are sending to our children. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend from New York that I do not have other speakers remaining, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. These bills don’t have the support they need to pass the Senate. It takes 60 votes to even bring them to the floor. That means that this entire exercise this week has been an exercise in futility. All the while, the clock is ticking and Congress has so much to do, as I have elaborated several times this afternoon, over the next 9 legislative days. If this process has been good for anything, it is revealing just how broken the legislative process has become under the majority’s rule. Legislation regularly comes to the House floor without any committee consideration. It just goes to rules. The majority even rammed through a healthcare repeal bill not long ago—I am sure everybody remembers that— that would impact onesixth of our entire economy without first—what we need to do again in regular order—getting a score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. They are very important. They tell us what cost and what impact it would have on the budget and on the country. So that means we had no idea of the impact of that bill on our markets or what it would cost when voting for it. The minority is routinely shut out of the process, often unable to get so much as a vote on an amendment on the House floor. When Speaker RYAN assumed the gavel, he promised to return to regular order and an open process. We have been waiting a mighty long time. Every time we offered an amendment to the bill before us in the Rules Committee, we asked that the rule be open; again, giving all Members a chance to affect that bill. Unanimously, we are voted against and we lose all those votes 9–4. That means that both sides will not be able to affect that bill and it means that regular order is as far away as it ever was. Here we are, less than a month away from the end of the fiscal year, and we haven’t passed a budget resolution through the House. We were supposed to have a budget through the House, the Senate, and the conference—the conference is necessary to reconcile the House and Senate bills—by April 15. We blew through the debt limit in March and still have not dealt with that. We have yet to have a single open rule in the Rules Committee under the Speaker’s leadership. Believe me, I am sure that an awful lot of Members of this House have something to say about what is going on. It is no wonder that, according to the latest figures from Gallup, 79 percent of the public disapproves of how Congress is doing its job. No wonder. CBS News highlighted that it costs the taxpayers an estimated $24 million a week to operate the House of Representatives. They know that they are not getting their money’s worth. They needed 60 votes to repeal and replace healthcare, when there was no replacement in sight. I am not sure how to describe that as a legislative proposal, but what it sounds like to me is a hoax. We are going to fool you that we have really got a replacement here. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, the rule, and the bill. I hope that my good colleague, Mr. WOODALL , and I can help fix this place to do a little better. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I don’t dispute the polling numbers my friend from New York cites. In fact, I am as saddened by those numbers, as she is. But I also feel culpable; not culpable because of the work we are doing today—I think we should be proud—I feel culpable because we all find ourselves in conversations with one another where, instead of building the institution up, we run the institution down. What my friend from New York said about Ms. LEE’s amendment being changed in the Rules Committee, she is absolutely right, the amendment was changed. But, Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear: it wasn’t changed in some backroom deal with smokefilled air where no one knows what is happening and can’t read the bill. It was noticed. There was an entire paragraph dedicated to saying: Hey, this is unusual. This doesn’t happen that often. We want all the cards on the table so everybody knows. Just understand we made this change this time around. Mr. Speaker, getting the work done in this institution is hard. It leads to conflicting goals. You heard folks from the other side of the aisle say: We are not spending nearly enough time on this bill. We need to make even more amendments in order. And you heard folks on other side of the aisle say: This whole bill is an exercise in futility. I don’t know why we are wasting even one moment on it. It is tough to satisfy both of those concerns simultaneously. We have got this rule book called the United States Constitution. It doesn’t ask a whole lot of the United States Congress. It does ask us to appropriate the money. Under the leadership of both parties, Mr. Speaker, this House has failed to get that done on time year after year. This year, the bipartisan Appropriations Committee in subcommittee, in full committee, worked tirelessly, as I said, not for days, not for weeks, but for months. One bill at a time. In fact, one line at a time. That product was brought together by the Rules Committee last month, August 16, Mr. Speaker. That amalgamation of bills was posted on the internet for all the world to see and read. Every Member of this Congress had a chance to bring their ideas about how to make it better. The Rules Committee got together, looked at those ideas, made more of those ideas in order for debate than we have seen in decades for bills that get completed on time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentlewoman from New York. Ms. SLAUGHTER. The Rules Committee did not get together. The majority of the Rules Committee got together. We had no action in that game whatsoever. b1345 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I am always compelled to yield to my friend from New York because I am so fond of her and because her leadership has meant so much to this institution. My friend has served on the Rules Committee for even longer than I have, and so my friend understands how the Rules Committee works even better than I do. I don’t want to engage my friend in a colloquy, at least not in my closing statement. We should have this conversation on day 1. Please, my friend from New York, give us one more word. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, just to speak on accuracy: don’t say the Rules Committee got together and went over those. Say the Rules Committee majority got together and went over those. You know, that is all I ask. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I welcome my friend’s constructive counsel, but I know for a fact that her calendar looks just like mine does, and that means that we are going in in the early afternoon and we are not getting out till late at night. Why? Because you and I are sitting just three Members apart listening to Member after Member make their case, and in the spirit of accuracy, don’t let it be said that our Members coming and testifying doesn’t make a difference because it does. You and I both believe that. We know it to be true, and it is important that it be true. Those Members come and they testify, they make their case, and then we vote up or down on those amendments. 
Mr. Speaker, can we do better? We can. And I will work with absolutely any colleague of any political stripe of any region to do better at any time, but let’s do recognize that we made a commitment to ourselves to get this job done for the first time in a decade. By coming to the floor right now, Mr. Speaker, quarter of 2 on a Thursday afternoon passing this rule, we are going to get this job done together for the first time in a long time. Will we wake up tomorrow and try to do better? You know that we will. Should we take a moment to thank the folks who helped us get here? You know that we should. Mr. Speaker, you are surrounded left and right by Members of the House team. The parliamentarians worked tirelessly to approve the amendments, to make sure they are all written and drafted properly. I want to thank the parliamentarian team for the work that they do. Mr. Speaker, we kick CBO a lot in this place because we don’t like their score one day, we like it the next. CBO has to go through these amendments, score these amendments. I am grateful to them for the work they did to make this possible. Legislative counsel goes through, with each Member of Congress, making sure that every ‘‘i’’ is in the right place, every ‘‘t’’ is crossed. It is not a small task. It is a gargantuan task, and they do it on these big bills day in and day out. I am grateful for that. You are starting to see some of the appropriators come down, Mr. Speaker. Long after my friend from New York and I have left this Chamber, the appropriations team is going to be here until the wee hours of the morning once again going through each and every line and each and every amendment. I think about what my friend from Louisiana said about the school children who are turning on C–SPAN and watching this process. I don’t know what they think goes into making this happen, but what I know goes into making this happen is a lot of hard work, staff work, Member work, a lot of big hearts, and a lot of big brains sitting down together hashing through these issues. This rule is worth supporting. The underlying legislation is worth supporting, Mr. Speaker, and I ask all of my colleagues to do exactly that. The material previously referred to by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is ENTITLED to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. PEARCE for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Chairman, this rule by the BLM is a classic example of agency overregulation at its finest. Should the new regulations take effect, lessees and operators will be forced to maintain original gas charts, measurement tickets, calibrations, verifications, prover 
and configuration reports, pumper and gauger field logs, volume statements, event logs, seal records, and gas analysis. Most of these documents have nothing to do with determining the amount of production at a lease and will force businesses to hire more staff just to keep records. This will also likely result in more Federal employees to oversee the bureaucracy. This makes zero sense and is simply creating work and overregulation for no reason. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I think it is clear that what is at stake is 2.6 billion barrels of oil a day made from wells that make maybe one or two barrels, three barrels a day. They are not extremely economic, but those businesses are located in New Mexico. Those businesses keep their headquarters there. They are just small momandpop operators that care enough about the energy business to stay out there, and so when the government does things that says we are not going to let you operate, that we are going to shut you down, it accomplishes what the Saudi Arabians have never been able to accomplish, and that is defeat the spirit that says we can survive any attacks. Mr. Chair, again, I urge people to support this amendment and the underlying bill, H.R. 3354, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 63 OFFERED BY MR . PEARCE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 63 printed in House Report 115–297. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico for 5 minutes. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the venting and flaring rule was, again, put in place by the last administration, intending for BLM to regulate methane. Historically, that had been regulated by the EPA. Now, keep in mind that methane production from oil wells is down 21 percent since 1990, while production is going up. Production is going up, methane production is down. So we wonder why the administration came at the last second to put this rule into place. Basically, the argument is exactly the same for opposing that venting and flaring rule that what is at stake are not the good wells. Those wells are going to produce in their economic with whatever burdens are placed on them. What is at stake are the stripper wells which, again, make up 2.6 billion barrels of production in the U.S. every day, 145 million barrels of production in the State of New Mexico. So you can imagine the economic catastrophe if that 145 million barrels weren’t available to the State to both tax and to provide jobs. Again, 40 percent of New Mexico’s pay, roughly the teachers’ pay, the police pay, roughly that much comes from oil and gas production. You can do the math and see how much New Mexico would be affected if this venting and flaring rule continues to place the burden on the well. The estimates are for each well that a cost of $60,000 is going to be required to come into compliance. Again, keep in mind that this rule comes after the methane is more carefully controlled today under greater production than it ever has been. The estimates are that we will lose thousands of wells if this venting and flaring rule continues. Again, it is the stripper wells which are most at harm. If we lose the 2.6 billion barrels of stripper well production every year because of the high cost of implementation of the venting and flaring rule, that is going to mean we are less energy independent, that we rely more on outside sources. It is going to drive the price of gasoline up. The people who can afford it least are the people at the bottom of the economic ladder. They will be the ones penalized most by rising prices of gasoline and decreasing supplies of oil. Mr. Chair, again, I would urge people to support this amendment, the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 2 minutes. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM). Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague for yielding me time. Mr. Chair, yesterday the House passed a $7.9 billion downpayment to address the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey, which is projected now to cost as much as $180 billion—by far, today, the costliest hurricane to hit the United States. Today, we are considering an amendment which would prohibit BLM from implementing a rule to address the wasteful venting, flaring, and leaking of methane, which is a climate change causing emission 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. New Mexico is currently home to the largest methane hot spot in the world. Not only is methane a powerful greenhouse gas, but every cubic foot of gas that is wasted into the atmosphere cheats hardworking New Mexican taxpayers out of precious royalty and tax payments which go toward public education, infrastructure, and community development programs. Our State desperately needs these investments, and we cannot afford to let money disappear into thin air. BLM, in fact, should work with stakeholders, especially small independent producers who have lowproducing wells to make this workable. But taking a sledgehammer to our Nation’s energy policy is a shortsighted and counterproductive effort. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to collaborate to make this rule effective for producers and taxpayers alike. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ), the chairman of the subcommittee. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, the House has spoken several times on the Bureau of Land Management’s methane regulation in the past 2 years. I understand the administration is reviewing the regulation and that litigation is ongoing. In the meantime, I think action is needed, and so I support this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. The BLM venting and flaring rule, or the BLM methane rule, represents one of the Obama administration’s most egregious abuses of executive power designed to destroy responsible energy production on Federal land. BLM exceeded statutory authority by attempting to regulate air quality; authority that is vested solely with the EPA. Methane emissions from oil and natural gas have significantly declined in recent decades without duplicative Federal regulations in a time when oil and gas production in the U.S. has surged. It is frustrating that this rule is somehow cloaked under the idea that it will benefit taxpayers. It won’t. It is an onerous rule with no connection to the reality of the physics and chemistry of energy production. It will reduce American energy production on Federal land and, therefore, reduce royalties due to the U.S. Treasury. This amendment brings accountability to executive rulemaking. I thank Congressman PEARCE and applaud him, as well as Congressmen 
Westerman and Cramer for their similar amendments crippling other Obama rules. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ) has expired. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, as I said, I rise in opposition to this amendment, as clearly this amendment would prohibit BLM from regulating flaring, venting, and leaking of methane from Federal onshore oil and gas operations. In 2016, the BLM finalized its rule which updated regulations that were almost over 30 years old. We have learned a lot about how we have to be more diligent about capturing energy and making America more energy secure, because this rule would prevent the waste of an estimated 65 billion cubic feet of natural gas a year and save taxpayers $330 million annually. BLM has a responsibility to the taxpayers, and that means capturing what is flared off, what is burnt off, which is potential energy. We have developed technologies in the past 30 years to capture this and make it work even more effectively for the taxpayers when we lease out these leases and royalties. Just for a fact, I share that the Bakken oil field, when it was at its height, flared more—I am from the Twin Cities—flared more and brighter than the metropolitan area in St. Paul and Minneapolis. That is how bright the flare was that the satellites captured at night. That was burning energy, energy consumption that should have been captured because we owe it to future generations to get it right when it comes to our energy production. Mr. Chairman, the amendment is bad for public health, it shortchanges the American taxpayers, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. I don’t think we are going to change each other’s minds on this because the bottom line is, and I have been consistent with this, this belongs in the Policy Committee. This only would change something for a year. You would have to come back year after year after year. If there is something where we can find common ground on, we can find it in the Policy Committee. We can’t find it on an Appropriations Committee where it expires every year. I ride the elevator with the gentleman, Mr. Chair, and I am sure he is going to enlighten me some more. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. b2300 The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico will be postponed. The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 64 will not be offered. AMENDMENT NO . 65 OFFERED BY MR . MCEACHIN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 65 printed in House Report 115–297. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division A (before the short title), insert the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It would prevent the Department of the Interior from preparing a new 5year offshore oil and gas leasing program that schedules leases before the year 2022. Mr. Chairman, offshore drilling carries real consequences, from the industrialization of our coasts to the inescapable risk of another BP Deepwater Horizonlike disaster. Those risks can not be eliminated. As Deepwater Horizon made clear, accidents can inflict damage of an almost unimaginable scale. BP has spent billions of dollars responding to that disaster. That figure reflects liabilities that arose from massive and irreparable damage to our environment, permanent harm to economically essential industries, and countless other impacts on the Gulf Coast residents’ quality of life. We have to make sure that other regions are never exposed to those kind of harms. That is why my amendment is important. In the event of a drilling accident, thriving coastal economies could be decimated. Industries that rely upon a healthy marine environment—everything from the tourist trade to our fisheries—could disappear overnight. If a spill were big enough—and we have seen that they can be enormous— the economic consequences would ripple throughout the national economy, hurting millions of Americans who live many miles from the sea. Again, we cannot afford such economic risks. It is equally foolish to risk the natural beauty, fragile habitats, and irreplaceable species for the benefit of a few massive oil and gas companies. Our coasts are home to some of our most iconic and unique wildlife. Healthy oceans are critical to traditional ways of life, having provided subsistence resources for many generations. Those places, those species, those customs are part of why we live in the greatest country on Earth. No other place could match the richness and diversity of the United States of America. We must not endanger the incredible heritage in a quest for dirty energy, especially the kind of fuels that can drive catastrophic changes to our climate, with grave and permanent consequences for our society. It is important to note that prohibiting the preparation of a new leasing program does not stop any of the currently scheduled lease sales until 2022 from happening. My amendment just puts us back on the regular schedule for writing the next plan. Prohibiting the preparation of a new leasing program, however, does ensure that millions of taxpayer dollars are not spent reworking a plan that was just completed this year. Restarting a new 5year leasing process would throw away 21⁄2years and tens of millions of dollars of effort, ignore overwhelming bipartisan opposition from millions of people up and down our coasts, and eliminate the protections that President Obama provided for the fragile Arctic. Mr. Chairman, the risk of a new 5 year offshore oil and gas leasing program are simply too high and the consequences are too severe. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I certainly sympathize with many of the comments that the sponsor of this amendment has brought up. Certainly, none of us have any intention of trashing the environment, of causing environmental degradation in any of our coastal areas in the United States. But the thing is that this amendment doesn’t cut production. It would not result in any reduction in oil and gas exploration and production activities. And if it were to do that, then all that would happen is it would increase our dependence upon foreign imports of oil. The reality and statistics are very clear. You are less safe transporting energy than you are producing it. The statistics are very clear. Putting it into a ship is less safe. Putting it into a pipeline is less safe than actually producing it. So you are not doing anything to benefit the environment. The next thing is that, within approximately 1 month of the Obama administration’s being sworn into office in 2009—as I recall, I believe it was on February 10—Secretary Salazar stood 
up and said: We are rewriting the 5 year offshore leasing plan of the previous administration. They walked right in and said: We are throwing this out. Which the amendment’s sponsor said was billions of dollars in implications and much planning. It is exactly what the Obama administration did. So if the Trump administration chooses to take a fresh look at these resources and these resources, then I want to quote the Obama administration saying that these are offshore energy resources that belong to all Americans. Mr. Chairman, I want to make one other note. If you read the amendment, it says that none of the funds made available in this act may be used to repair a 5year offshore oil and gas leasing program that would schedule any Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lease sale before 2022. This wouldn’t just prohibit making changes to it, such as, perhaps, the idea of expanding it if public comments and other input found that that was the best thing to do, but it also would prevent slowing down the lease sale schedule. Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to this amendment. While I certainly support the gentleman’s intent to prevent any type of environmental harm and degradation, I just want to say in closing that I was the lead trustee for the State of Louisiana in the Deepwater Horizon spill. When you look at Outer Continental Shelf energy production, we had produced trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. We had produced billions of barrels of oil. What the courts found in the BP incident was that there was gross negligence and willful misconduct. They didn’t find that there were problems with the rules and other things. That is why, as the gentleman correctly started, that they had to spend tens of billions of dollars paying for their gross negligence and willful misconduct, which is very different than the trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, and billions of barrels of oil that we have produced safely; we produced them in the United States; and we have not put them in pipelines and tankers in other less safe mechanisms of transportation. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, what is the balance of my time? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ), the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, this amendment would prevent the Department of the Interior from performing a necessary and thorough review of the existing 5year plan. Meanwhile, the committee encouraged a review of the 5year plan in the 2017 omnibus, which we just enacted just a few months ago. For these reasons and others, I certainly urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I just want to say that, once again, while I understand the gentleman’s intent to prevent any type of environmental degradation—I think everyone shares that objective—the reality is that this amendment doesn’t do anything to advance that objective. And potentially, should there be some type of emergent situation where you would want to slow down lease sales, this amendment would actually prohibit that from happening. We should take a fresh look with public input and with the best science to determine where we produce, how we produce, to maximize domestic energy production, to maximize or to reduce dependence upon foreign energy, to maximize economic opportunities and employment opportunities in the United States. Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, just briefly, of course, I was not here at the time, but it was my understanding that this is nothing unlike what the other side of the aisle did during the Obama administration. So what this amendment seeks to do, in many cases, is not that unusual. And while the gentleman is correct, the size of the payments that BP had to make were because of a certain type of conduct: What we want to do is just freeze things where they are. While I acknowledge that there is a possibility that somehow someone wanted to slow down the process, I don’t believe that this administration would do just that. Again, millions of dollars have been spent. Much time has been spent in developing this plan. I think we just need to leave it in place. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 66 OFFERED BY MR . GROTHMAN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 66 printed in House Report 115–297. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, while I understand the gentleman’s intent, I share his concern with the 2015 ozone standards, the bill’s language in the amendment goes a little too far. It ties this new administration’s hands with respect to reconsideration or flexibility efforts that they are trying to build in at the present time. Meanwhile, the ozone language in the underlying bill provides the necessary administrative relief for communities to comply with the overlapping 2008 and 2015 requirements. I think that this administration understands the complexities that are being imposed by this 2015 requirement. They are trying to deal with it. Mr. Pruitt has indicated that publicly. Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ). The amendment was rejected. b2315 
AMENDMENT NO . 67 OFFERED BY MR . LAMBORN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 67 printed in House Report 115–297. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division A (before the short title), insert the following: 
So I agree with the gentleman that we need to do a better job of making sure that these reviews are done in a timely fashion. I agree that, when a species has attained a classification where it is no longer threatened or it is no longer endangered, it should come off. So I think we have a lot in common. But I think that the challenge with this amendment is that, without the funding, in order for the Service to do the job that it has to do, it just kind of puts the Service in a box in which we are saying you are not doing a good job and, therefore, we are going to start changing the way in which we proceed. So I, right now, have to oppose this amendment. But as I said, in the policy committee I think that there is room for some of us to come together and to make improvement, but legislating this rider for 1 year at a time on this appropriations bill doesn’t allow us to have the deep, transparent, and open discussion that we need to have to resolve your issue. So at this time I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ). Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman’s comments. If we get additional resources in the future, I would love to make sure that Fish and Wildlife has the resources to make sure they meet their mandates, and they should meet them now. One of the mandates they have is review the status of every listed species every 5 years and a corresponding change in the status if it is called for by those reviews. Instead of doing those reviews, in many cases, the Service chooses to spend the money to list more species. If the government isn’t willing to shoulder the responsibilities that come with listing species under the ESA, perhaps it shouldn’t be listing those species in the first place. So I think they need to meet their obligations under the law. I certainly support this amendment, and I encourage Members to support the amendment and vote for it. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for that statement. I will say to the gentlewoman from Minnesota that I would love to work with her on this. I know that, in the Natural Resources Committee, we are going to be looking at some of the different facets of the Endangered Species Act, and I hope we can continue this dialogue. This amendment seeks to make the agency comply with the law. That provision is in there for a reason, so let’s enforce what Congress, in its wisdom, put into the law many years ago. Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 68 OFFERED BY MR . LAMBORN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 68 printed in House Report 115–297. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division A (before the short title), insert the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse is a tiny rodent with a body approximately 3 inches long, a 4 to 6inchlong tail, and large hind feet adapted for jumping. This largely nocturnal mouse lives primarily in streamside ecosystems along the foothills of southeastern Wyoming south to Colorado Springs, in my district, along the eastern ridge of the Front Range of Colorado. To evade predators, the mouse can jump, like a miniature kangaroo, up to 18 inches high. In 1998, it leaped onto the Endangered Species list, a move that has hindered development from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Wyoming. Among projects that have been affected: the Jeffco Parkway southeast of Rocky Flats, an expansion of Chatfield Reservoir, and housing developments in El Paso County along tributaries of Monument Creek. Builders, landowners, and local governments in affected areas have incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in added costs because of this mouse. Protecting the Preble’s mouse has even been placed ahead of protecting human life and property. On September 11, 2013, Colorado experienced a major flood event that damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, important infrastructure, and public works projects. As a result of the Preble’s mouse being listed as an endangered species, many restoration projects were delayed as Colorado sought a waiver. In fact, FEMA was so concerned that they sent out a notice that stated: ‘‘Legally required review may cause some delay in projects undertaken in the Preble’s mouse habitat.’’ It went on to warn that ‘‘local officials who proceed with projects without adhering to environmental laws risk fine and could lose Federal funding for their projects.’’ While a waiver was essentially granted, the scientific evidence simply does not justify these delays or the millions of dollars in taxpayer money that go toward protecting a mouse that is actually part of a larger group that roams throughout half of the North American continent. Scientific studies have concluded that the Preble’s mouse does not warrant protection because it isn’t a subspecies at all and is actually related to the Bear Lodge jumping mouse. Even the scientist that originally classified this mouse as a subspecies has since recanted his work and agrees that the Preble’s mouse subspecies designation is no longer defensible. Moreover, the Preble’s mouse has a low conservation parity score. What that means is that hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent on protection efforts that could have and should have been spent on other more sensitive species. My amendment would correct this injustice that has been caused by the inaccurate listing of the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse. It would refocus U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s efforts on species that have been thoroughly scientifically vetted and that should be managed by the Endangered Species Act. This exact amendment was added to the fiscal year ’16 Interior Appropriations bill by voice vote and was added to the fiscal year ’17 bill by a bipartisan rollcall vote. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment for a third time. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. b2330 Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, clearly, what this amendment does— and it is different from the other amendment—is prohibit the Fish and Wildlife Service from implementing or enforcing the threatened species listing of the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse under the Endangered Species Act. It fullout restricts the Service from offering any critical protections to preserve the species. Once a species like this is listed under the Endangered Species Act, the role of the Fish and Wildlife Service is fairly permissive. They can help parties comply with the act as they carry out their other activities. The Service right now is reviewing and considering all the comments that they received during the public comment period, and a draft recovery plan is being worked through to develop a final recovery plan. But with this 
amendment, the Service would not be able to continue to recover the species. All the Endangered Species Act prohibitions would still apply. So, in other words, we would stop them from moving forward, but they would still be under jurisdiction to comply. They wouldn’t be able to comply by working with agencies and land developers and landowners to provide the ESA compliance. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would be barred from issuing permits or from offering exemptions. That means landowners, industry, and other parties who might need to take the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse incidental to otherwise lawful activities, such as urban development, are vulnerable to thirdparty lawsuits. Another limitation that the Service would have would be undertaking the required status reviews of subspecies or initiating any rulemaking or downlisting or delisting species. So now we are talking about deep dives into what the U.S. Fish and Wildlife may or may not be impacted by doing or helping landowners or developers on an appropriations bill. Quite frankly, as I have been saying all night—and I understand people have the right to come here with these amendments—the Service has a responsibility to implement the Endangered Species Act. They are charged with fulfilling their legal requirements. When they don’t fulfill their legal requirements, it makes them more vulnerable to lawsuits, which I know is not the goal of the author of this amendment, Mr. Chair. But when there are lawsuits incurred, it creates more costs for American taxpayers. The gentleman’s amendment would just undermine the Service’s ability to work collaboratively with States and local communities. It opens the Service up for lawsuits and it would create even more uncertainty for landowners and make them vulnerable, as I said, to lawsuits. I think we should be working to support the Fish and Wildlife efforts, not blocking the agency from doing its job and going back to what we discussed earlier, that is working through the committees of authorization, and then the authorizing committees having conversations with the Appropriations Committee on how they can achieve their goals, this being one of them. Because of those reasons, I do not support this amendment. I thank the gentleman for bringing this forward, but at this time I cannot support it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ) to weigh in on this issue. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to jump up and support this amendment. Obviously, the agency has not leaped fast enough and problems persist. So I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment, and I know it will squeak by with a large margin. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I will conclude by saying there is one other sort of a temporary element in this whole episode. And that is when you go from Colorado into Wyoming, the mouse is no longer threatened or endangered. There is a political boundary line between the two States. In its wisdom, the Fish and Wildlife Service says that if you go north far enough across the State line, it is no longer threatened or endangered. There is an element of arbitrariness that I think also calls into question why this was ever done in the first place. Mr. Chairman, I would ask support for this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. LAMBORN ) having assumed the chair, Mr. BERGMAN , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. GARRETT (at the request of Mr. MCCARTHY ) for today. 
SENATE BILLS AND CONCURRENT RESOLUTION REFERRED Bills and a concurrent resolution of the Senate of the following titles were taken from the Speaker’s table and, under the rule, referred as follows: 
S. 597. An act to increase Federal Pell Grants for the children of fallen public safety officers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Education and the workforce; in addition, to the Committee on the Judiciary; and to the Committee on the Budget for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned. S. 652.
