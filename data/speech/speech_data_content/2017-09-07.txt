Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and say farewell to a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce staff who has dedicated more than 20 years of public service to the people’s House. Ed Gilroy began his congressional ca-reer on the staff of former Congress-man Rod Chandler of Washington, but most of us know him for his nearly 16 years of service as the committee’s Di-rector of Workforce Policy. Ed led our efforts to expand access to affordable healthcare for small-busi-ness employees, provide moms and dads more flexibility in the workplace, and protect the rights of workers and em-ployers. When we think about the pas-sage of the bipartisan Pension Protec-tion Act in 2006 and the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, we have to think of Ed. Ed Gilroy has been a trusted adviser, dedicated public servant, distinguished colleague, and an invaluable member of our committee family. We are deeply grateful for his many years of service to the American people and the U.S. House of Representatives, and we wish him all the best in the years ahead. 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST CHARTER  
SCHOOL  
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, something monumental occurred for students and families who were seeking a new way to pursue a high-quality education. Twenty-five years ago, our Nation’s first charter school, the City Academy, opened its doors in St. Paul, Minnesota. City Academy began a new era for school choice and provided fam-ilies with an alternative option to the traditional public school system. Today, over 3 million students are en-rolled in charter schools, and more than 6,800 have opened in over 40 States. Charter schools are not only growing as an option for students, but these schools are also getting results. Inno-vative charter schools are providing thousands of students and families with the hope and opportunity that they can receive a high-quality edu-cation and gain the skills they need to succeed for the future. I congratulate City Academy for being a true pioneer in school choice 25 years ago and support the expansion of school choice for American students and families. HONORING ALEXANDER FURNITURE ACADEMY  
Mr. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the efforts of the CVCC Alex-ander Furniture Academy, located in Taylorsville, North Carolina. This fan-tastic facility hosts a program where students are taught the basic skill lev-els required to gain employment as a sewing operator or upholstery crafts-man within the furniture trade. Under the leadership of Center Direc-tor Eunice Mays and thanks to the generous scholarships awarded by many groups like Craftmaster Incor-porated, AHFA, and others, nearly 50 students have graduated, and almost all are now employed. I wholeheartedly commend Eunice and the Alexander Furniture Academy as well as all of its sponsors for putting together a program that doesn’t just teach valuable skills to would-be job seekers, but a program that literally helps individuals build the skills they need to succeed from the bottom up. In the last 6 months, students have crafted 90 sofas and chairs and 20 loveseats which have been sold. The profits from the students’ creations are invested in scholarships and help to keep the academy open. I commend the Catawba Valley Com-munity College Alexander Furniture Academy teachers, staff, and students on this terrific program.

FUNDING FOR THE FAA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. B
ASS) for 5 minutes. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my dissatisfaction at the majority’s failure to allow consider-ation of amendments I proposed to the appropriations bill that include fund-ing for the FAA. The Rules Committee did not forward those items so my col-leagues could consider and vote on them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH7092 September 7, 2017 
My amendments represent beginning steps toward addressing what has be-come an intolerable level of noise from planes in my district. The amendments will not see debate in this body, how-ever, despite the fact that noise affects the health, well-being, and economic livelihood of people in every part of the country, whether they are Republicans or Democrats. When Congress directed the FAA to update how we control our airways, we were promised that, by reworking the Nation’s airspace and using satellite technology instead of radars, our Na-tion’s flight system would become not only more efficient, but cleaner and quieter. Next Generation systems were sup-posed to allow virtually automated air traffic control, eliminate circling over-head waiting for a landing slot, and fa-cilitate smooth gliding flight descents without noisy engine power. Plus, planes would be able to stay higher longer, and FAA’s published flight pro-cedures would specify minimum alti-tudes over heavily populated areas, meant to ensure that effects on the ground were minimized. That is not what we got. Eight of the country’s busiest and most complex metropolitan areas, called metro-plexes, have seen NextGen implementa-tion so far. Phoenix, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C., are just a few of the metroplex victims who have de-cided to take legal action against the FAA. The D.C. Circuit Court recently ruled in the Phoenix case, noting that the FAA had not paid enough attention to the effects of its actions. In every case, noise that used to be spread out across a wide area became concentrated over narrowed corridors, visiting misery on those living below. The best analogy I can offer is this: Imagine that all of the traffic using a 6-lane highway was narrowed to a sin-gle lane. The concentration of that much traffic would surely cause consid-erable problems. Well, that is exactly what has hap-pened in the southern California metroplex implementation. Areas that used to see planes flying overhead every 15 or 20 minutes now feel bombarded by flights as close together as every 3 minutes or less. As you can imagine, sometimes those planes and narrowed highways might get too close together. Air traffic con-trollers have to keep minimum separa-tion for the safety of all involved. But in order to adhere to that narrowed lane, controllers tell the pilots to devi-ate from the flight path by going down-ward. Sometimes they fly at half, or less, of what the minimum altitude is supposed to be. So planes that are sup-posed to fly at 6,000 feet may fly as low as 3,000 feet at a frequency of every 3 to 5 minutes. I hope that you can appre-ciate that that noise is intolerable. Film production of all types, whether TV commercials, movies, or videos, is an economic driver in my district. The neighborhoods of the 37th Congres-sional District have been used to rep-resent cities and towns across the con-tinent. Though you might not know it, I am sure you have seen both Culver City and the historic West Adams district, built over 100 years ago, in some of your favorite TV shows and movies. Unfortunately, the movie studios of Culver City and the homes of West Adams are directly under the new, nar-rowed flight path. Studios are com-plaining about having to move produc-tion from their back lots because of the noise. I have elderly constituents who have lived in their neighborhoods for dec-ades and who rely on income from loca-tion filming to help them remain in their homes. Film scouts have told them that the frequent loud plane traf-fic makes it impossible to film there anymore. At this point, countless American and European health studies have dem-onstrated the harms that come from exposure to noise—and at much lower levels than that experienced by people on the ground. The arbitrary and out-dated 65 decibel day/night level that the FAA uses to determine acceptable levels of exposure is calculated at an average of sound over a 24-hour period. Parents with young children have told me that their kids’ sleep patterns have been disrupted by unrelenting noise, enough to alter their academic performance. A health clinic serving the affected areas has begun to investigate whether a spike in reported health problems, in-cluding poor control of chronic condi-tions like hypertension, can be related to the constant exposure to excessive noise. The European Union standard for noise exposure at night is half of the U.S. level and is still cause for health concerns there. In the absence of consideration of my amendments, I invite my colleagues to join me and nearly 40 other colleagues in the House Quiet Skies Caucus, which is working to make progress on this important issue. My constituents and I know many of my colleagues’ constituents are suf-fering under the burden of excessive airplane noise as a result of the imple-mentation of the FAA’s Next Genera-tion project. We cannot and must not sacrifice the health of those on the ground in the name of airline effi-ciency.

CALLING ON THE SENATE TO MAKE CTE A PRIORITY THIS FALL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. T
HOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, during the August in-dis-trict work period, I had the privilege of visiting CPI in Pleasant Gap, Pennsyl-vania. CPI is the Central Pennsylvania Institute of Science and Technology. I was proud that my colleague, Con-gressman RAJAKRISHNAMOORTHI of Illi-nois, was able to join me in Pennsylva-nia’s Fifth District at CPI on the first day of school. CPI was founded in 1969 to meet the career and technical education needs of high school students in Centre County. By combining academies with tech-nical training and industry-recognized certifications, CPI is uniquely poised to prepare students for rapid employ-ment and long-term career success. CPI offers more than 18 secondary pro-grams, over 60 in-house adult and con-tinuing education programs, and more than 350 online courses. In addition to exceptional classroom and hands-on instruction from a highly qualified, experienced faculty, CPI of-fers certification in a wide range of dis-ciplines, a notable advantage to CPI graduates and their employers. Congressman K
RISHNAMOORTHI and I were at CPI to talk about our bill, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This House unanimously approved the bill in June, and I call on the United States Senate to make it a priority for this fall. Mr. Speaker, our bill is the first major overhaul to the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act in more than 10 years. The bipartisan leg-islation strengthens and improves ca-reer and technical education and gives Americans the skills they need to com-pete for in-demand jobs. This can be witnessed firsthand at CPI. This November, CPI will launch a new 2-year degree program: Natural Gas Compression—CAT/Ariel Emphasis Associate of Specialized Technology. The program is in partnership with the Cleveland Brothers, a Pennsylvania- based Caterpillar dealer, and Ariel Cor-poration, the world’s leading manufac-turer of natural gas compressors. CPI is currently accepting students for a November 28, 2017, start date. It is only one of two programs of its kind nation-wide. Ariel Corporation compressors and CAT engines are located in oil and gas fields throughout the world. Graduates of CPI’s natural gas compressor degree program will have an opportunity to work locally, nationally, and globally. Cleveland Brothers, Ariel, and gas in-dustry partners will be interviewing the NGC students after the first term. If pre-hired by the program’s industry partners, students will receive com-pany-sponsored tuition reimbursement. Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the type of career and technical education in-vestments we should be making and en-couraging. By educating Americans in high-demand fields, they can climb rungs on the ladder of opportunity and obtain family-sustaining jobs. I will continue to advocate for these important reforms that will benefit Americans from all walks of life. I urge the Senate to take up our bill without delay. It is important to close the skills gap and give every American a chance at having a fulfilling career.

I want to thank the staff of CPI for not only hosting us on the first day of school, but for working to educate students in their chosen fields. Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to act on this bipartisan bill without delay because it is critically important to closing the skills gap in this country, and above all else, it is a win for the American worker and American fami-lies. Let’s help all Americans learn to earn.

HONORING ARMY SPECIALIST MATTHEW TURCOTTE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. C
ICILLINE ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, on August 23, Army Specialist Matthew Turcotte was killed during a live ammunition exercise at Fort Car-son in Colorado. Specialist Turcotte was a lifelong resident of North Smithfield, Rhode Is-land. He joined the Army 2 years ago and was assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. He died a hero, having earned numer-ous medals for his service to our Na-tion, including the Army Achievement Medal and the Global War on Ter-rorism Service Medal. Last Saturday, hundreds gathered in Providence to give Specialist Turcotte a hero’s fare-well at his funeral mass. All of us know, who serve in this Chamber, that our country owes an enormous debt of gratitude to all who have served, and especially to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice on the altar of freedom. My thoughts and prayers are with Specialist Turcotte’s family today, es-pecially his wife, Megan, and his par-ents, Raymond and Liza. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ’S DECISION TO TERMINATE  
THE DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD AR -
RIVALS PROGRAM  
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I also want to spend a moment to speak about President Trump’s decision to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It is one of the cruelest in Presidential actions in recent memory. This was a shameful moment for our country. America has always stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity, but not right now. The DACA program has allowed near-ly 800,000 DREAMers to work, study, and serve their communities and Na-tion. That includes nearly 1,300 DREAMers in my home State of Rhode Island. The DREAMers are workers and tax-payers. They pay $3 billion in taxes each year, including $2.6 million in my home State. They contribute $2 billion each year to Social Security and an-other $470 million to Medicare. They didn’t choose to come here. They were brought here by their par-ents as very young children. They love this country. They share our values. They are contributing to their commu-nities every single day. They are young men and women like Lesdin Salazar, a 22-year-old Rhode Is-lander who came here from Guatemala with her parents when she was 7 years old. Lesdin was a high school junior when President Obama signed an exec-utive order to establish DACA. She was later accepted to Rhode Island College, where she is paying out of pocket today to pursue a degree in teaching. Lesdin also works at Calcutt Middle School in Central Falls, Rhode Island, where she helps kids who need behav-ioral and emotional support, but she will have to give up this dream unless Congress acts. The same is true of Ana Abigail Molina, a 27-year-old Rhode Islander who came to the United States when she was just 6 years old. Today Ana works at Thundermist Health Center and has dreams of going back to school to become a surgical technologist. And like so many DREAMers, Ana doesn’t really remember much of the country where she was born. She considers her-self an American. Javier Juarez also considers himself an American, a young man who just graduated from Rhode Island College and is planning to attend graduate school on an academic scholarship at Brown University starting this fall. His dream is to one day attend Harvard Law School. Javier has been living in Rhode Is-land for 18 years. Before DACA, he couldn’t drive, get a good job, or go to college, but now he is the first member of his family to graduate from a 4-year university. He, too, will have to give up his American Dream unless Congress acts. And finally, Maribel Rivera Sosa, who came to Rhode Island from Mexico at the age of 9. When she graduated high school 5 years ago, Maribel didn’t think she would be able to attend col-lege, but just days later, when Presi-dent Obama established DACA, Maribel’s opportunities became limit-less. She was able to attend the Com-munity College of Rhode Island while working three separate jobs. After earning an associate’s degree, Maribel enrolled at Johnson & Wales Univer-sity, and her dream is to earn a mas-ter’s degree in health administration. Who among us thinks that someone who works three jobs shouldn’t be able to follow their dreams? This is just cruel. President Trump is ripping apart hundreds of thousands of families and injecting chaos and uncer-tainty into the lives of members of our community who know no other home than America. If Congress doesn’t re-place DACA with the Dream Act, it will result in $460 billion in lost eco-nomic activity over the next decade, including $61 million in Rhode Island. Republicans in Congress need to bring the Dream Act to the floor right now. We need a permanent solution, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bipartisan Dream Act. We need to bring that bill to the floor. Every Re-publican who disagrees with President Trump’s actions needs to tell Speaker RYAN to bring the Dream Act to the floor. This Congress must act in a manner worthy of a country that has inspired these young DREAMers and pass the Dream Act without delay.

AFGHANISTAN: EMPIRE STOPPER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. D
UNCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, on September 4, 4 days ago, The New York Times International Edition carried a story, entitled, ‘‘The Empire Stopper,’’ which said foreign powers have tried to control Afghani-stan since the 19th century. The story had a very interesting first paragraph: ‘‘When the American author James A. Michener went to Afghanistan to re-search his work of historical fiction ‘Caravans,’ it was 1955 and there were barely any roads in the country. Yet there were already Americans and Rus-sians there jockeying for influence.’’ Continuing the Times’ quote: ‘‘Later, the book’s Afghan protago-nist would tell an American diplomat that one day both America and Russia would invade Afghanistan and that both would come to regret it.’’ Michener wrote that 62 years ago. Since then, Afghanistan has been de-scribed many times as the ‘‘Graveyard of Empires.’’ This 17-year war in Afghanistan has always been more about money than anything else, and it should have been ended long ago. Many people wonder why we keep sending so many soldiers and military contractors to Iraq and Afghanistan. Well, it has always been about money, increased appropriations for the Defense Department, and huge profits for the contractors who hire re-tired admirals and generals. There have been so many examples of waste, fraud, and abuse in these Middle East wars that it is sickening. One re-cent example was reported this way by Newsweek: ‘‘U.S.-based security firm Sallyport Global has been accused by two former internal investigators of smuggling al-cohol, stealing, keeping two different account ledgers, and even human traf-ficking of prostitutes while executing an almost $700 million contract to pro-tect Balad Air Base in Iraq, The Asso-ciated Press reported Wednesday.’’ Military bases should be protected by military personnel, not highly paid contractors, but most Members of Con-gress are afraid to criticize anything the Defense Department does for fear of someone saying they are not ‘‘sup-porting the troops.’’ We now have over 11,000 troops in Af-ghanistan and probably that many or more contractors in addition to no tell-ing how many Federal civilian employ-ees. Then we are also paying more than

330,000 Afghan military and police per-sonnel. The international community is now providing 60 percent of the Afghan GDP, and almost all of these so-called peacekeeping—really, U.N. wars—the U.S. taxpayers are paying over 90 per-cent of the cost. When the so-called coalition bombs go astray killing civilians and women and children, they are really seen by the locals as being U.S. bombs, cre-ating even more hatred and resentment for our country. We have now had almost 2,500 young American soldiers killed in Afghani-stan and 20,000 wounded, many maimed for life. We have spent $1 trillion di-rectly on this war and even more indi-rectly. Mr. Speaker, the American people don’t want forever, permanent wars. This Afghanistan folly has lasted four times longer than World War II. We should have come home a long time ago.

PERSONAL STORIES OF DREAMERS IN PORTLAND The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B
LUMENAUER ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I was standing next to J
OHN L
EWIS as we joined our Democratic col-leagues from the House and the Senate who delivered a spirited message of re-solve to fight Donald Trump’s cruelty towards almost 800,000 young Ameri-cans and, of course, several million other members of their families, their friends, their employers, who all had their lives turned upside down by Trump’s senseless, unnecessary deci-sion. Strange for somebody who professes to love the DREAMers, Trump is caught in his own trap. He clearly didn’t know what he was doing, trying to figure out ways to pass responsi-bility for his decision on to others. But, of course, that is sort of what we have come to expect from someone who appears to care only for himself. He was afraid, even, to deliver the message himself. Typical of Donald Trump, he outsourced the decision to Jeff Ses-sions, who Trump spent most of the summer demeaning. Now, I think there is a simple solu-tion: take it back. Donald Trump is fa-mous for mulligans on the golf course, do-overs. If he didn’t like the shot, he would just do it again. Well, let’s de-clare a DACA mulligan. Take it back. Yes, it might look foolish, but that really hasn’t stopped him before. In the meantime, the outrage builds: the community of faith, the business community, people across the country who are understanding the lunacy of this decision, its unfairness. But the most telling and powerful points are from the young DREAMers themselves. My colleagues have delivered this message from people whom they have heard from in their districts. I have countless ones that have been shared with us. Jamie, a 31-year-old father of two, a DACA recipient, was 12 when his fam-ily fled to the United States to escape poverty and corruption. For 9 years, he has dedicated his life to helping young people cope with these challenges. He is working with young people impacted by the issue, concerned about their mental health and their well-being. Eddie arrived from Mexico as a 1- year-old baby. He really didn’t under-stand the impact of being undocu-mented until he applied for college and was not eligible for Federal assistance, but eventually he attended and grad-uated from Portland State University; and he has become the first undocu-mented student admitted to Oregon Health & Science University School of Dentistry. Scheduled to graduate next year, he wants to be able to serve the community that raised him. Karla, arrived as a 4-year-old, is cur-rently a student, but whose concern is the message that is being sent to oth-ers whom she works with. DACA recipi-ents are not all young professionals or valedictorians. Some work in fast-food restaurants and are struggling to get through community college. She makes the point that some may call her a DREAMer, but she felt that the real DREAMers were her parents, who had the dream for her. They fought to come to this country to raise her and give her the opportunity to work, attend school, and live without fear of deportation. These are compelling stories, Mr. Speaker, but the one that stands out in my mind most clearly was one of my first meetings after the election. I was meeting with a number of the young DREAMers, listening to their concerns, their apprehensions. The conversation stopped with one young man who just said, ‘‘What country should I go to?’’ He had choices to go to Canada or Eu-rope. He was an accomplished student, ambitious. ‘‘What country should I go to?’’ I must admit, at the time, I counseled him to not give up on the United States too quickly. I wonder what he thinks today.

HONORING CLIFF GLOVER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. F
ERGUSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of one of the Third Dis-trict’s most upstanding citizens, Mr. Cliff Glover. Mr. Glover passed away last month at the age of 104, but not before touch-ing countless lives in our community. His community service began at a young age in the Boy Scouts, an orga-nization that he would work with for the rest of his life, earning the rank of Life Scout and the Silver Antelope Award for his service to the organiza-tion. Mr. Glover also served his Nation in the Civil Engineer Corps of the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War II, working on the U.S. Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida, now known as Cape Canaveral. b1030 In the private sector, Mr. Cliff suc-cessfully led the Batson-Cook Con-struction Company as it built many important buildings and developments throughout the southeast. I consider myself blessed to have known Mr. Glover personally, and his commitment to serving others helped inspire my own public service. I want to challenge all of my col-leagues, friends, and neighbors to carry on his legacy of serving others. f 
A 21ST CENTURY AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. D
EFAZIO) for 5 minutes. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Well, Mr. Speaker, I was just reading a message from Citi-zens for On Time Flights. Now, I fly a lot and I would love to be on time more. They are talking about our aviation system here. Air traffic control is a World War II relic and say-ing that if we only would give it over to the private sector, i.e., the airlines, it would work better. Well, let’s see, a couple of things wrong with that statement. Number one, the greatest problem with air delays is weather. Now, actually, we are dealing with that technologically through a new system called Datacom, where, at our 55 busiest airports, the pilots and the air traffic controllers now can communicate by text and they don’t have to repeat over and over on the radio the messages; many fewer misunderstandings, easier to reroute. This has been implemented by the FAA. What is the number two cause? Oh, it is airline operations and sched-uling—the airlines themselves. They are the second greatest cause of delays, they, in themselves. So it turns out that Citizens for On Time Flights is actually funded by a group of airlines. Now, what is the bottom line here? Do we have a World War II relic, as Gary Cohn has said after he read some of this and heard this propaganda? No, actually. We have the most ad-vanced system in the world. We could fly planes today closer together using GPS technology called ADS-B and not use the older radar system, except—the system is up and running, except the airlines won’t pay to put the equip-ment in their planes. They say it is too expensive. So they are complaining about the FAA and saying they could do a better job, they could do it more efficiently, they could fly planes closer together, but they won’t invest in the equip-ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7095 September 7, 2017 
Now, it is very expensive. For in-stance, American Airlines would have to spend 40 percent of last year’s bag-gage fees to equip every one of their planes so they could use this modern system—40 percent of their baggage fees. Wow, what a hit they would take for that. Now, what is the bottom line here? The bottom line is we fund the cur-rent system—the largest, most com-plex, most advanced in the world—with a tax on the tickets. It is a progressive tax; the more you pay for your ticket, the more you pay for air traffic con-trol, 7
1⁄2percent tax. For years the airlines have said to me: That’s our money. I said: What do you mean it’s your money? I pay the tax when I buy a ticket. They said: No. That’s our money. We should have it. In fact, a few years ago, when the FAA bill expired for 2 weeks because of a chairman named John Mica, every airline in America, except for one— when the 7
1⁄2percent tax went away for 2 weeks, every airline in America, ex-cept Alaska Airlines, raised their tick-et prices 7
1⁄2percent. So what is the bottom line of this bill? This bill—going to be pushed by the Republicans over here—would repeal the 7
1⁄2percent tax. That would be a $10 billion windfall for the aviation indus-try. And then what? How are we going to pay for it? Well, the private corporation will de-cide. Congress will have nothing to say about how it is paid for, and it is going to be paid for with a head tax. So you get on the plane; they will say: Oh, it’s 50 bucks to sit in that seat, to use the public airspace of the United States of America. That’s how the corporation is going to pay for it, with a head tax. So we go from a progressive tax to a regressive tax. If you buy a $50 ticket, you are going to pay 50 bucks to sit in the seat. So it is now $100. Today you would have paid $3.75. So that is the real bottom line here. It is not about efficiency. It is not bringing the system up to date. Now, they have done a great job with this propaganda, and the chairman of the committee has done a great job. They talk about those paper strips. They use paper strips in the traffic control towers. Well, yeah, we do. It works real well. We replaced them in the en route cen-ters, but we haven’t replaced them yet in the towers. It is infallible. It has worked forever. It is efficient. But we are going to go to electronic flight strips, and we are going to do it in a way that actually is going to improve the efficiency of the system and dis-patch planes better. Now, they say: Well, Canada has elec-tronic flight strips. Yeah, they did it for billing purposes because they charge per flight. They don’t, and are not going to, have the new system we are going to have, which is going to sort out all the planes by their future routes, every-thing as they depart from the airport, and it is going to be way more effi-cient. So, actually, the FAA is doing an ex-cellent job. And 7 to 10 years ago I never would have said that. But they have got it straightened out over the last 7 years. Randy Babbitt and Mr. Huerta have got it straightened out. It is working today. There is a GAO report, which I am re-leasing today, which the Republicans tried to repress, which says, in fact, the system is on time, on budget, and, in fact, privatization will delay the modernization of the system. So the House is going to push and the Republicans are going to push for a bill that actually is going to set us back in-stead of moving us forward into the 21st century air traffic control system. f 
HOUSTON STRONG The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O
LSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, a monster Category 4 hurricane named Harvey hit my home. It hit us very hard. And 2 days after the first blow, it hit us once again. It reversed course and hit us twice in the span of 2 days. It took out our schools, our shops, our homes, our pets, and the lives of over 50 Texans. But there is one thing that Harvey can never take from us, and that is, we are ‘‘Houston Strong.’’ Houston Strong is the Smith family. Annie was going into labor as her apartment was being swallowed up by floodwaters. She and her husband, Greg, were doctors. They prepared to have a home delivery of their first child. Their phone calls for help were unanswered. Annie called her church and, within an hour, a rescue truck drove up. That is her right there, being assisted on the rescue truck an hour after she made that call. Twelve hours later, their family grew by one. Their daughter, Adrielle, was born. The Smith family is Houston Strong. Houston Strong is Buster Stoker and the Cajun Navy. Buster and his buddies from Louisiana brought 14 boats to res-cue others in our disaster. Buster said: ‘‘There were a lot of submerged cars and street signs underneath us.’’ It re-minded Buster of cypress knees in the marshes at home. Buster rescued over 100 people, seven by seven. Buster and the Cajun Navy are Houston Strong. Houston Strong are our first respond-ers, our police officers, firemen, EMS drivers, our military, the entire Texas National Guard. And first responders include normal, everyday Texans like this man carrying a mother and her baby out of harm’s way. Texans are Houston Strong. Two days ago, I took a helicopter tour of the damage with Leader MCCARTHY . The crew on our Coast Guard helicopters rescued 2,000 people in harm’s way. And I am sure this scene was played out over and over in-side those helicopters—a neighbor, glad to be alive, her hand resting on a res-cuer’s shoulder. Our first responders are Houston Strong. Houston Strong is the thousands of volunteers who have been in shelters and churches and schools all through-out southeast Texas. I went to this high school, Cinco Ranch, in the Katy Independent School District. This was up and running within 24 hours of get-ting the go order. They had food, water, toiletries, clothes, and a smile. I saw on those people who lost every-thing smile after smile after smile be-cause of volunteers at shelters like Cinco Ranch High School. Shelters in Cinco Ranch are Houston Strong. I have saved the best for last. This young boy’s name is J.W. Claburn, IV. He lives in my district, Richmond, Texas. This young boy’s photo is ex-actly what I have been trying to con-vey these last 5 minutes. In closing, I will say that we—Amer-ica is strong, Texas is strong, and Houston is stronger because of Hurri-cane Harvey.

CONDEMNING PRESIDENT TRUMP’S DECISION TO END DACA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. K
ELLY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn in the strongest possible terms the President’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Child-hood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. This issue should be very simple. These are children who were brought here by their parents, through no fault of their own. They grew up with our kids, attended the same schools, played on the same playgrounds, and learned to drive in our neighborhoods. These kids are Americans in their hearts and in their minds, just not on paper, yet. Beyond that, my faith, my con-science, my understanding of basic eco-nomics prevents me from supporting this cruel and inhumane decision by President Trump. If we are to love our neighbors as ourselves, we must remember that we, too, were once strangers in a strange land. Many of us have our own immi-grant stories, stories of how we became Americans. My family’s story begins like many of yours. My great-grandfather, Metro, was born in Austria in 1881, and my great-grandmother, Margaret Skrutt, was born in Ukraine in 1882. They got married and knew that they could find a better life in America; so, in 1906, they took a chance and came to Amer-ica, arriving on November 1, 1906. They settled in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, because other Ukrainians already lived there. They joined the community, worked hard,

went to church, raised a family of Americans, including my grandmother, Anna Guryesh. My great-grandparents’ story is the story of America. It is the story of im-migration and immigrant families dreaming of a better life and making America great. It is the same story repeated 24 years later when Mary Anne McLeod boarded the Transylvania in Glasgow on May 2, 1930. Nine days later, she arrived in New York with $50 in her pocket. Eighty-six years later, her son was elected President of the United States of America. At the age of seven, a young woman left Cuba, fleeing communism. In 1989, she became the first Latina elected to Congress, and it is a privilege to serve with her. Melania Knavs was born in Slovenia. She first became a permanent resident, and then a citizen of the United States. This young lady, born in southeastern Slovenia, now lives in northwest D.C. as the First Lady of the United States of America. Daniel, one of my constituents who I helped with his DACA status: He works hard, pays his taxes, loves this coun-try, his country, as much as any other American. So many great Americans are Ameri-cans by choice, not by birth. This has made America the greatest, strongest, wealthiest country in the world. We can attract the best, the brightest, the most driven and the most talented. People like Dr. Elizabeth Stern was born in Kansas, but, in 1915, became an American. She drove forward our abil-ity to detect and treat cancer. b1045 Author Ayn Rand, a favorite of the Speaker, was born in 1905 in Russia, and came to the United States in 1926. Actress Natalie Portman, born in 1981 in Jerusalem, came to the U.S. as a toddler. Alonso Guillen was born in Mexico but died last week as an American hero working to save lives during Hurricane Harvey. At the last Olympics, Americans born in places like Australia, Kenya, and Poland brought home nine medals, including two gold for the United States. Their stories are all the same. They came to America seeking a better life and a better future. They contributed to our society and our culture. They made America great. Margaret and Metro’s story is Amer-ica’s story. America’s story is Mary Anne’s story and Daniel’s story. This is the story of us, the story of America. It is a story that no President’s pen can erase. America’s story is Melania’s, Ayn’s, and the story of Albert. We are America, and we are here to stay. No matter where you were born, we are America, and we are here to stay. No matter what language you speak to your mom in, we are America, and we are here to stay. We are America, and we are here to stay because America’s story is our story. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President.

HEROIN AND OPIOID USERS NEED ‘‘A WAY OUT’’ OF ADDICTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today full of sorrow and hope for those caught in the cycle of addiction to her-oin and opioids. This destructive plague is taking aim at Americans across the country— young and old, rich and poor, rural and urban. Nowhere is this more true than in the Chicagoland area, a hub for drug traf-ficking spreading across northern Illi-nois, the Midwest, and the United States. The collar counties of Chicago have felt it strongly. This year, in Will County alone, there have been 61 acci-dental overdose cases and 44 deaths from heroin and fentanyl overdoses. This is an extremely discouraging pace, surpassing previous years. The numbers are similar across the seven counties that I represent in the 14th Congressional District. Stories have been long untold, and it continues to gain national attention. It still haunts our communities today. I got involved in this issue more than 3 years ago when I met Ken Chiakas, who lost his 17-year-old daughter Stephanie to a heroin overdose. To-gether, we launched our community ac-tion plan on heroin, an analysis of our community leadership forum on the problem, an audit of existing and pro-posed community partnerships, and the next steps for our communities, our State, and our county. In the years following this initiative, I have hosted meetings with law en-forcement officers, treatment center workers, advocates for patients and lost loved ones, State and local govern-ment officials, emergency room physi-cians, pharmacists, and drug manufac-turers. Last month, my staff and I traveled throughout McHenry and Lake Coun-ties to hear from local officials first-hand who are experiencing this plague every single day. Law enforcement first responders are on the front lines fighting drug traf-fickers and dealers. They are also sav-ing lives by reviving abusers in the midst of an overdose through the use of naloxone. It is now common practice in these police and sheriff’s departments to have naloxone ready to be deployed in the hands of capable and trained of-ficers. Many lives have now been spared through its use. But even these encouraging numbers do not tell the whole story. Countless others live and struggle to fight heroin and opioid abuse every day in search of treatment and battling towards recov-ery. They know what it is like to face an overwhelming force controlling their lives. It affects their relation-ships, it affects their outlook on life, it affects their ability to obtain and keep quality jobs. Local officials expressed great con-cern at the loss of workforce, and the many months and years of career ad-vancement and experience those caught in addiction have lost. Busi-nesses are concerned by their search for qualified workers that doesn’t yield enough or any applicants. Families are concerned that, without adequate out-patient treatment, their loved ones are far more likely to relapse, compounding these workforce and com-munity problems. That is why, among other programs, Lake County law enforcement has worked hard to implement the ‘‘A Way Out’’ program. Police officers and sher-iffs’ deputies come into regular contact with those caught in heroin and opioid abuse, sometimes seeing the same of-fenders in police stations and prisons several times a month. Many of these men and women want to be free but don’t know how, and a police officer is the last person they think to ask for help. A Way Out em-powers police officers and opioid users to work together to end the destructive cycle of abuse, dependency, arrest, and relapse. The program is simple. Those who se-riously want help can ask for it from a police officer or at a police station and can receive help without fear of arrest or inability to pay for treatment. Offi-cers who see the destruction of opioids every day want to help. All that is required is for the person seeking treatment to choose the path of recovery. Individual motivation is essential to success. As of last summer, 15 people at 8 different police depart-ments have taken advantage of this initiative. Similarly, DuPage County launched Project Connect, a prearrest program through which individuals who have been administered Narcan are imme-diately offered treatment options and a case manager to see these men and women through to recovery. I am so encouraged by and proud of the success stories I hear throughout the 14th Congressional District every day. Hope is near when those in recov-ery see a vision of what their life can be like after dependency—a life filled with healthy relationships, challenging and meaningful work, and a clear sense of individual purpose. We must do all we can to offer this hope to those still suffering from her-oin and opioid addiction. Connecting affected individuals with the people and organizations best equipped to help them is paramount to overcoming this devastating epidemic. It remains my goal to make northern Illinois the hub of the best minds and the best practices in heroin and opioid abuse prevention, treatment, and re-covery. I look forward to sharing these

KEEP THE DOOR OPEN FOR DREAMERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. K
ENNEDY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, we all suffer when this country breaks its promises. But for our children, that cost compounds. They pay the interest on our inaction and inadequacy. They pick up the pieces of the precious things that we broke, the sacred re-sources we took for granted, the bat-tles that we were too afraid to fight. Time and again, by choice and by chance, they have not disappointed. Their broad shoulders carry twice as much twice as far. Their spines prove twice as sturdy as the adults meant to protect them. American history is littered with the names of young men and women, and even boys and girls, forced to be heroes before their time: the patriots of D- day, memorialized in a statue called the Spirit of Youth in Normandy; 14- year-old Emmett Till, lynched by a lie; Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, all 14, and Carol Denise McNair, 11, four choir girls lost at the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Alabama. The Children’s Crusade. Little boys and girls, kids, who dared defy Bull Connor’s firehoses and attack dogs to be arrested and rearrested again and again as a Nation recoiled in horror. Nine African-American high school students from Little Rock marched into an all-White high school to prove that separate is not equal. Four college students from Kent State who gave their lives to a war- weary nation’s plea for peace. Thirteen-year-old Ryan White from Indiana who showed our Nation that an HIV diagnosis does not claim your dig-nity. The record number of men and women under the age of 21 who showed up at military recruiting stations in 2001, signing up to serve a nation reel-ing from terror on its soil. Nineteen-year-old Zach Walls who told us that love is love as he bravely defended his two moms before the Iowa State Legislature. Seventeen-year-old Lila Perry from Missouri who withstood the sting of stigma by being true to herself and her gender identity. Thirty-one-year-old Alonso Guillen, a Texan who traveled 120 miles from safety into the heart of Hurricane Har-vey’s fury on a volunteer rescue mis-sion, who gave his life so that others, strangers, might survive. His courage and sacrifice exemplify the best traits of our Nation. They place him squarely on the long list of young American he-roes who have carried us toward a more perfect union. But this week, President Trump slammed the door on 800,000 people like Alonso. DREAMers. Children raised in our neighborhoods, who run on our playgrounds, who pitch in our Little Leagues, who proudly march in 4th of July parades, who make lemonade stands, build snowmen, go to prom, and get summer jobs, who hit the books, who earn a living, who raise families of their own, who serve in our military, who give to this country just as much, just as faithfully as you or I. Now, our President told them that they are not wanted, that he would rather see them in handcuffs, their families ripped apart, their futures in limbo, sent to be strangers in a strange land. Mr. Speaker, sometimes this body has to make hard choices. Sometimes our solutions are complex. This is not one of those times. This one is easy. Our work comes down to a very simple question: What are we willing to ask our children to bear? We have the power in this body to say: Not this, not again, that we will not ask the youngest among us to force our country’s conscience to awake be-cause of the burden that we, the adults in the room, place on their shoulders. We can do better. We can be braver. We can change the course of that history. We will not stand here and leave it for future generations to wonder why we allowed such harm to pass.

KEEPING GUAM SAFE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. B
ORDALLO ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, yes-terday I introduced a resolution with 21 of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle condemning the threats North Korea made against Guam last month—you can imagine the fear that we had during this period—but also re-affirming the United States’ absolute and unshakeable commitment to Guam’s security, as well as that of the Pacific States, the territories, and our Asia-Pacific allies. Mr. Speaker, this threat against Guam and, indeed, our entire Nation, was inexcusable, and it demands firm condemnation from this House of Rep-resentatives. My resolution sends a clear message that North Korea’s continued willful disregard for U.N. resolutions, inter-national agreements, sanctions, and arms controls in pursuit of its illicit nuclear weapons program will not go unanswered by our government. I remain fully confident in the defen-sive capabilities on Guam and in our region, but it is vital that we do all that we can to prevent a military con-flict with North Korea and ensure that its regime does not continue down this path of reckless and destabilizing nu-clear militarization. I want to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution with me, and I hope that the House leader-ship will quickly bring it to the floor for consideration, and I urge all the Members to support it. CALLING FOR THE HOUSE TO TAKE UP THE  
DREAM ACT  
Ms. BORDALLO. On a separate topic, Mr. Speaker, I also want to echo my Democratic colleagues in calling for the House to quickly take up a perma-nent legislation solution such as the Dream Act, H.R. 3440, and lift the veil of anxiety that has been placed on nearly 800,000 DREAMers who live in and contribute to our community. b1100 I know one of those DREAMers on Guam. Her name is Christine. She is a registered nurse on our island and works every day to save lives in our community. And it is easy, Mr. Speak-er, to hear the number 800,000 and for-get that these DREAMers are real peo-ple. They are individual children or young adults who study in our schools. They work. They pay taxes. So can you imagine how disruptive this must be in their homes? They are our neighbors, our coworkers, our children’s class-mates and friends. They are first responders, service-members, reservists, National Guards-men, active military who serve on the front lines in our military. They are nurses, and doctors, businessowners, and entrepreneurs, and all DREAMers contribute to the fabric of our great country of America. So I hope that we will give these DREAMers the security of knowing that they will not be deported from the country that they love and have called home for most of their lives. They are Americans in all but paper, and we should treat them with the same com-passion and love that they have for our great country.

CONGRATULATIONS TO COACH ROBERT HUGHES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. V
EASEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I was privileged to see something very spe-cial back in December of 1995 in Texas high school sports history. Now, before you think this is a story of ‘‘Friday Night Lights,’’ it is not. This happened on the hardwood court of the Wilkerson Greines Activity Cen-ter in southeast Fort Worth. Four coaching legends on the court, all with 1,000 wins each: Morgan Wooten of DeMatha Catholic High School; Ralph Tasker, Hobbs High in New Mexico; Bill Kruger of Clear Lake High School just outside of Houston; and Coach Robert Hughes, Sr., of Dunbar High School located in Stop Six, Texas. They squared off in an extraordinary basketball game. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that of these four coaching legends, Coach Hughes has the most wins with over 1,300 victories.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH7098 September 7, 2017 
Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, Friday Sep-tember 8, will mark another special moment in basketball history for Coach Hughes as he is inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Spring-field, Massachusetts. Growing up in Fort Worth and having lived part of my childhood in Stop Six, I knew of Coach Hughes at a very young age. He was a legend before he retired. He is and was a master basket-ball strategist, coach, mentor to the boys he coached and the most promi-nent ambassador for high school sports in the State of Texas. When you would go to a Dunbar bas-ketball game and watch Coach Hughes work his craft, you ended up watching Coach Hughes as much as you watched the action on the floor. I saw this as a player that not only played against Coach Hughes, but also as a spectator and a fan for many, many years. Hughes and his longtime trusted as-sistant, Leonadas Rambo, fielded some great teams to rack up over 1,300 vic-tories. These wins were racked up at Dunbar High School and I.M. Terrell High School, which was shut down after desegregation. Coach Hughes would pace the floor while his teams ran up and down the court at a swift pace. He usually gave them lots of latitude when they made mistakes that he felt could have been avoided by using better judgment. It didn’t matter if you were the star point guard or the sixth man, he would stand up from the bench—and Coach Hughes always had his jacket unbuttoned—and with a look of disapproval on his face that was unmistakable, he would look down the bench—and I am going to say he would look down the bench with his signature look of tough love—and you knew that you were being pulled out of the game. There wasn’t anything that your mom or dad could do for you. That was the type of coach that Coach Hughes was. Coach Hughes earned the dedication of his players be-cause of the excellence that he ex-pected each and every day. I will never forget in one Whataburger Basketball Tournament in Fort Worth when Dunbar was play-ing Oak Hill Academy from Mouth of Wilson, Virginia. Oak Hill had at least five or six guys that were all over 6 foot 8, three of whom went on to major Division I careers at the University of Virginia and Kansas. Everybody at the gym that night, be-cause Coach Hughes didn’t have any-body over 6 foot 5, 6 foot 6, thought that Coach Hughes was outmatched. But with superior rebounding, pa-tience, and good shot selection, Dunbar won the game. I was there, and I viv-idly remember the audience being shocked, but inspired, by the victory. But no one should have been surprised. Once a reporter asked Coach Hughes who his favorite NBA player was, and it surprised everybody when he said Larry Bird was his favorite player. The reason why: he liked Larry’s legendary rebounding, fundamentals, blocking out, scoring, the type of things that may not have been fancy but led to vic-tories. But that is who Coach Hughes was. That was the kind of excellence Robert Hughes brought to coaching Fort Worth ISD and boys basketball in the State of Texas. And due to that fierce competitive streak in Coach Hughes’ Dunbar teams, they always made the playoffs. I will never forget one day Coach Hughes was quoted in the paper saying that the people who worked in the neighborhood, who worked at the var-ious jobs around town, at General Mo-tors, Miller Brewery, and Lockheed, they would always save up their vaca-tion time so they can go to the quar-terfinals and regional games in Mid-land, because everybody knew that Dunbar was at least going that far. And he could say that because it was true, and his teams could back it up. I will never forget one year when Dunbar didn’t make it that far and Coach Hughes shared his scouting re-port with another school. I believe it was Southwest High School. He shared his scouting report with the coach from Southwest of the team they were getting ready to take on in the playoffs because he felt that at least the other team in the Fort Worth Independent School District should have the chance to advance. That is the kind of class act he was on the court and he still is off the court today. The men that he made, Mr. Speaker, his former players include current win-ning high school basketball coaches and one of the top all-time assist lead-ers in high school and college sports history, James Cash, an I.M. Terrell graduate who was the first Black play-er in the Southwest Conference who went on to become the chair of the Harvard MBA program. In a State known for its Friday night lights, Mr. Speaker, there is not a sin-gle other person in high school sports who exemplifies this like Coach Hughes. Mr. Speaker, I am humbled with the opportunity to recognize the next member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, Coach Robert Hughes. Congratu-lations, Coach Hughes. Go Wildcats. Go I.M. Terrell.

REFORM CLOTURE RULE IN SENATE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks after the 2016 election, I spoke on the House floor and warned that the greatest single obstacle to meeting the expectations of the American people was the cloture rule in the Senate. I said: ‘‘Voters elected Republican ma-jorities in both Houses of Congress and they expect action. They’ll get it from the President and from the House. But in order for the Senate to rise to this occasion, it must reform its cloture rule.’’ Well, it didn’t. Now, cloture is the Senate motion to conclude debate, and it is based on a sound parliamentary principle that as long as a significant minority—cur-rently, 40 Members of the Senate— want to continue to debate, that de-bate should continue. This principle as-sumes it is an actual debate between real people regarding the merits of the subject directly at hand, but that is not what cloture has become. Today, any Senator can block vir-tually any bill simply by filing a pro-test, and until 60 of the 100 Senators agree to take up the bill, it cannot be heard. Thus, a motion designed to pro-tect debate has now degenerated into a motion that very effectively prevents debate. It also hands practical control of the Senate to the Democratic minor-ity, which can effectively veto any pro-posal by the majority, essentially re-versing the result of the last election. This is not some act of God or con-stitutional constraint that has been forced upon the Senate. No, this is a deliberate choice by Senate Repub-licans not to reform their cloture rule. It has rendered the Senate dysfunc-tional and, with it, the Congress. Earlier this year, the Senate briefly recognized this and chose to reform cloture for Supreme Court nomina-tions, but not for the legislation abso-lutely vital to the interests of our country. The news yesterday that the Presi-dent has now had to capitulate to Democratic demands on the debt limit should come as no surprise. By failing to reform cloture, Senate Republicans have effectively given CHUCK SCHUMER  operational control of the Senate. That is how we got wrapped around the axle on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. The House could have passed a comprehensive bill that com-pletely and cleanly abolished ObamaCare and fully replaced it with all of the market and tax reforms that Republicans agreed with and cam-paigned on, popular reforms that put consumers back in charge of their healthcare decisions and placed those decisions within their financial reach. Instead, the House leadership chose to attempt this through a budget proc-ess called reconciliation, a process completely unsuited for complex policy reform. They did so for one reason: to bypass the Senate cloture rule. By ad-hering to the very limited and re-stricted requirements of budget rec-onciliation, the House produced a man-gled, tangled mess that fell well short of the reforms we had promised and, ul-timately, failed to receive even a sim-ple majority of the Senate. Those who supported this process ar-gued that a clean, complete, com-prehensive bill would have been dead on arrival in the Senate for lack of Democratic votes for cloture. Well, I doubt that. Quite the contrary. Had the House done its job through regular

order rather than trying to cover for the Senate Republicans’ bad choice, one of two things would have happened: Senate Democrats would have been seen as the single obstacle to a pop-ular, comprehensive reform while ObamaCare continued to implode and, quite possibly, eight of the most vul-nerable Democrats would ultimately have crossed party lines and supported this rescue of our healthcare system; or, far more likely, Senate Republicans would have been forced to come to the same conclusion that they came to with respect to the Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch and reform this rule. Certainly, we couldn’t have been any worse off than we are today. I would ask that, henceforth, the House leadership stop covering for the Senate Republicans and move all of the legislation that we promised the Amer-ican people to the Senate through reg-ular order. It is time we left the man-agement of the Senate to the Senate, stopped enabling their atrocious judg-ment on not reforming cloture, and made it very clear to the American public why the reforms they entrusted us to enact aren’t being sent to the President. Senator Dirksen once noted, when they feel the heat, they see the light. It is time the House and the American people adopted this maxim.

HONORING FALLEN KISSIMMEE POLICE OFFICER MATTHEW BAX-TER AND SERGEANT RICHARD ‘‘SAM’’ HOWARD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. S
OTO) for 5 minutes. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, it happened on a Friday night, August 18, that Ser-geant Sam Howard and Police Officer Matthew Baxter responded to a report of three suspicious persons around Palmway Street and Cypress Street in Kissimmee. I remember hearing about it. It was unfortunate because a vet-eran, a marine who lived in our com-munity, had a moment of post-trau-matic stress disorder and ambushed these two Kissimmee police officers, killing one nearly instantly and the other only a little over a day later. Officer Matthew Baxter was 27 years old. He grew up in Baltimore and moved to central Florida after high school. He had been with the depart-ment for only 3 years. He met his wife, Sadia, a detective of the Kissimmee Police Department, on the job. He left behind his wife and four young chil-dren, the youngest under a year old. He was courageous and passionate in his devotion to public service, and he was known as a sharp dresser and as someone with overwhelming con-fidence. Sergeant Richard ‘‘Sam’’ Howard was 36 years old, born and raised in Kis-simmee. He served in the Army and fought in Iraq. He was a 10-year vet-eran of the department and a member of our SWAT team. He left his wife, Billie Jo, and teenage daughter, Unique, behind. My wife and I got to visit his wife’s classroom and brought supplies to her students, knowing how difficult it was. He was a family man, hardworking, very optimistic, and quite the fast talker, as we were reminded by every-body during his wake. There are moments like these that test our will, our strength, our compas-sion. There are moments like these that test our community and even our faith. And more than we can ever imag-ine, there are moments like these that test the families of Sergeant Sam How-ard and Officer Matthew Baxter. We are here today and I am on the floor today to proclaim aloud what we already know in our hearts to be true. And make no mistake about it: these men were heroes, and we will never for-get their sacrifices. They are heroes because they got up every day and put on the Kissimmee Police uniform. They went out in our community every day to protect us. And, yes, they put themselves in harm’s way every day to keep us safe. These men are heroes because they were good family men. They were lov-ing husbands, great fathers, and they were pillars of our community. b1115 Yes, these men were heroes because when the moment came where they had to lay their lives on the line to protect our community, they did so without hesitation. For those reasons, we will never for-get Sergeant Sam Howard and Officer Matthew Baxter. On August 21, 2017, an American flag was flown over our Capitol in honor of Sergeant Howard, and on that same day, an American flag was flown over our Capitol in honor of Officer Baxter. These flags cannot take away the pain caused to their families. They cannot take away the pain caused to our community, to their fellow offi-cers, and to the police department in general. But they were flown over our Nation’s Capitol for a very good rea-son—to show that their lives matter, their sacrifices matter, and that their families matter. For that, they remain in our hearts, they remain in our thoughts, and they will always be in our prayers. God bless Sergeant Sam Howard, Of-ficer Matthew Baxter, and their fami-lies.

DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. V
ARGAS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the recent deci-sion made by the Trump administra-tion to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. By ending the DACA program, this administration leaves 800,000 people, mostly young adults and children, without any legal protections. DACA gives these individuals, most of whom were brought to the United States as very young children, the op-portunity to work hard, study hard, sustain their families, and contribute to their communities. DACA recipients are taxpayers, they are students, they are soldiers, and they are our neigh-bors. I would like to mention one DACA recipient that I know. Her name is Jac-queline. Jacqueline was brought to the United States when she was 2 years old. She excelled in school and was an Ad-vancement Via Individual Determina-tion—or what we call AVID—student in high school. She did very well. She was a strong candidate for admission to many of our top universities. When DACA was announced in 2012, it helped Jacqueline come out of the shadows and pursue her educational dreams. She did exactly that, and now she is a double major. She is doing very well. DACA gave Jacqueline and her family hope for a better future. It gave her a chance at the American Dream. By ending DACA, this administration is taking away the hopes of 800,000 DREAMers like Jacqueline and threat-ening their deportation to countries that are very unfamiliar to them, places they may have never known— except, of course, when they were 2— and they have no family there. I would like to thank the religious leaders who have come forward and have urged us to do the right thing and to pass a law to allow these kids and these young adults to stay here and to participate in our community as they have been doing. I would like to read a letter now that was written by the religious leaders here in Washington to the President. As leaders of the three Abrahamic faiths, we look to our sacred texts and traditions in seeking to follow the way of peace. Our respective teachings are clear, and we speak with one voice when we say: Supporting the dreams of young immi-grants in the United States is consistent with the foundational values of our Nation and with the moral imperative of extending hospitality to the stranger, of caring for im-migrants and children, and of loving our neighbors as ourselves. Nearly 1 million young immigrants have benefited from the DACA program since its inception in 2012. Among that number, many of the program recipients are members of our respective faith communities as well as the communities we mentor in and around the Nation’s Capital. We have witnessed firsthand the relief and pride in our young people’s faces as they fi-nally came to feel validated and safe by par-ticipating in a program that made them feel more at home—in the only country that they have ever really considered their home. But now anxiety and fear for their future has returned. We note that DACA has widespread support across the country and among politicians who agree on little else, for good reason. DACA has dramatically improved the lives of these young people and the communities in which they live:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH7100 September 7, 2017 
Ninety-five percent of the DACA partici-pants are working or attend high school; Sixty-eight percent of those working have seen their pay increase and, thus, are paying higher taxes; Fifty percent now have driver’s licenses, which makes the roads safer for everyone; Fifty-four percent have purchased their first car; and Twelve percent have purchased their first home. Rescinding DACA would have a wide-spread, devastating impact not only on a generation of industrious young people, but also on their families, communities, and our society as a whole. Thus, we add our voices to those urging you, Mr. President, to keep this policy in place until Congress puts in place a perma-nent solution. It is our collective prayer that in the com-ing months congressional leaders work to-gether to pass sensible and comprehensive immigration reform that our country so des-perately needs, including making the DACA program permanent. But until that time comes, the least that our country can do is to continue supporting our DREAMers. Keep DACA in place, Mr. President. Faithfully, The Right Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Wash-ington; Rabbi Bruce Lustig, Senior Rabbi of Wash-ington Hebrew Congregation; Imam Talib M. Shareef, The Nation’s Mosque; His Eminence Donald Cardinal Wuerl, Archbishop of Washington. 
Mr. Speaker, we can do the right thing. We can pass comprehensive im-migration reform, and we should. But at least we can pass DACA. I know, Mr. Speaker, that there is goodwill on both sides. Let’s come to-gether over this and do the right thing as our community leaders and as our religious leaders are asking us.

DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. A
GUILAR ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, today is not a good day for our Nation. Today, 800,000 young people across this coun-try are living in fear. They fear being ripped apart from the only home they have ever known. They fear being sepa-rated from their families, from their friends, and from the lives they have built here. They fear deportation, Mr. Speaker, and they live with this fear because President Trump has decided that the Federal Government is going to break its promise and turn its back on DREAMers. These are young men and women who did not break the law—they were brought to this country as children— who went to school here, who work here, and who pay taxes here. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program brought these young people out of the shadows and offered them some relief. It gave kids who grew up here and who truly believe that America is their home a chance to lead normal lives and chase their dreams. The fact of the matter is, though, Mr. Speaker, that DACA did not go quite far enough. DREAMers are American by every measure except for their pa-perwork, and it is time that we offer them a path to citizenship. That is why I am here today to call upon my colleagues to bring the Dream Act back to the floor for a vote—no policy riders, no packages, just a straight up-or-down vote. Because if there are Members of this Chamber who still believe that DREAMers should remain in the shadows and that they should not have a chance to join our Nation as citizens, then they should stand up and be counted. Many of my colleagues here come from all walks of life. They have charted their own path, however dif-ficult it may be to join this House. DREAMers have earned that chance to carve their own path, too. They have earned the right to live without fear and in peace as Americans. Passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, it is the moral thing to do, and, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is the Amer-ican thing to do. f 
HURRICANE HARVEY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. M
AXINE WATERS ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, on August 26, Hurricane Harvey began a path of unprecedented destruction across southeast Texas. The historic levels of rainfall were so extraordinary that the National Weather Service had to add new colors to its map graphics just to record it. As of August 30, it was estimated that 24.5 trillion gallons of water had been dumped over Texas and Louisiana. Harvey is now being called the most extreme rain event in United States history. Year after year, the natural disasters that hit the United States are becom-ing more frequent and more severe. Democrats understand the root cause: climate change. It is long overdue for President Trump and the congressional Republicans to admit the truth. Quickly following the tragic news that Harvey was on a path to cause catastrophic flooding in Texas, Presi-dent Trump pledged to help pass the necessary financial aid to begin the long recovery. But, of course, the President and Members of Congress all knew we had better not deny or delay funding for this very devastating nat-ural disaster. The American people expected their government to quickly respond to Har-vey. However, we must understand that there are other laws and policies that must be protected, laws that determine what the Congress can do and must do to assist our country with mitigation, preparedness, mapping, and affordable national flood insurance. The NFIP must be dealt with and must be under-stood. So Mr. Trump’s previous record on the issue is appalling and is in direct contradiction to his latest pledge. Just days before Harvey made landfall, Trump repealed an Obama executive order that would have required the Federal Government to account for cli-mate change so that infrastructure could be built to withstand cata-strophic events. Trump also sent Con-gress a budget that cuts funding for programs that help us understand, pre-pare for, and recover from storms like Harvey. His budget slashes operations and funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s climate research, cuts $62 million from the Na-tional Weather Service, eliminates the Regional Coastal Resilience grants, guts Coastal Zone Management grants, and cuts $190 million from the National Flood Insurance Program’s flood map-ping program. Trump’s budget would also cut $114 million from the Department of Agri-culture’s disaster assistance that would help farmers recover livestock, crops, and equipment that would be felt in Texas where many farms are currently under several feet of water. His budget also completely elimi-nates HUD’s Community Development Block Grant and HOME programs, vital grant programs that serve as one of the first available sources of funding to help communities recover even before disaster relief funding can be appro-priated from Congress. What is more, Trump’s budget would have cut $876 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, the very fund that he is now pledging billions of dollars of support for. So we are pleased that he learned after the fact. All told, Trump would cut billions of dollars for disaster pre-paredness and disaster relief programs. Of course, he also appointed a known climate change denier to lead the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency. So I, for one, am not surprised that this is where his priorities lie. The hypocrisy and shortsightedness do not end with Donald Trump. Let us remember that many House Repub-licans, including both Texas Senators, opposed disaster aid following Superstorm Sandy. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, they are asking for billions of dollars in taxpayer support for their constituents. Of course, we should pass a disaster aid package quickly and without hesitation because it is simply the right thing and the American people expect us to do it. But just as we are now witnessing the sud-den change of heart for disaster relief in certain Members of Congress, I hope that we will see a similar change of heart in response to the push of certain Republicans to unwind the National Flood Insurance Program.

We stand on the floor of the House of Representatives today asking for Your divine guidance and wisdom for the men and women who have been elected and sworn to represent the interests of the people of these United States of America. I pray that they would serve with hu-mility, dignity, and honor, enacting laws that would be fair, just, and equi-table. You have blessed this Nation with great wealth and great resources. Thank You. Help us to be mindful of the disen-franchised, despondent, dejected, and especially those who have been affected by Hurricane Harvey. We pray for Your protection for those in the path of Hur-ricane Irma. Lord God, I humbly beseech You to hear my prayer. Enable this gathering to hear and believe in the power of prayer. In Your holy name, I pray. Amen.

Reverend Murphy truly embodies what it means to love your neighbor as yourself. In his 18 years as senior pas-tor at the Mt. Zion Progressive Mis-sionary Baptist Church, he has been a dedicated disciple of Christ, giving his time, energy, and compassion to lifting up his congregation and the larger St. Petersburg community. In addition to his duties as pastor of one of the largest churches in Pinellas County, Reverend Murphy has been a leader in economic revitalization ef-forts in south St. Petersburg, and in supporting job training and outreach programs for at-risk youth. A native of Florida, truly a man of God, and a man of the people. I person-ally thank Reverend Murphy for com-ing to the people’s House and providing such a moving, thoughtful invocation. God bless you.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to honor a Catawba County na-tive. Mr. Greg Brunt has won more than 100 medals in the Special Olympics and serves as an inspiration to the wider Catawba community and, in my opin-ion, the Nation. Mr. Brunt’s road cannot have been easy. He has overcome challenges that many Americans don’t have to face. In-stead of giving in, Mr. Brunt gives back. As a swimming instructor to younger students, Mr. Brunt teaches children the value of practice and per-severance. Mr. Brunt has earned many Special Olympic medals, and has aspirations of being in the Catawba County Hall of Fame. Though I am not a voting mem-ber of the board, Mr. Brunt would have my vote. Additionally, I was thrilled to learn that Mr. Brunt is a man of faith, who attends Corinth Reformed Church, and that his favorite song is ‘‘Amazing Grace.’’ When I think of the amazing accom-plishments Mr. Brunt has achieved, I cannot help but think, how sweet the sound. I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr. Brunt on all of his many wins, and wish him continued success. f 
WE MUST PASS THE DREAM ACT (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, America is founded on the promise that if you work hard and play by the rules, then we will have a place for you. That is the American Dream. There is no reason it shouldn’t extend to peo-ple who were brought here as young children and have been working since then to build a better life. San Diego is home to 38,000 residents who could be eligible for DACA, the seventh most of any county in Amer-ica. DREAMers are our friends, our neighbors, and our coworkers, and our economy is more prosperous because of their contributions. Like so many, I was saddened and angry at the decision by President Trump to end the DACA program. It was a cruel action, rooted in fear, that only makes us weaker. Congress must act swiftly to correct this economic and moral catastrophe. We must pass the Dream Act to protect DREAMers, and give them and their employers the certainty that they de-serve. The time is right now for Congress to finally step up and do its job. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President.

RECOGNIZING LEACY BURKE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere gratitude and appreciation that I have the oppor-tunity to recognize Leacy Burke, former communications director for South Carolina’s Second Congressional District. I will always appreciate Leacy for her years of service on behalf of the people of South Carolina. A native of South Carolina, Leacy is an esteemed alumna of the University of South Carolina, where she graduated with both a bachelor of arts degree in political science and criminal justice, as well as a master’s degree in mass communications, integrated commu-nications. Beginning as a deputy press secretary for the office in 2015, it has been an honor to work with such a dedicated public servant making mean-ingful provisions for our office. It is with mixed feelings, but great happiness, that our office bids Leacy farewell. She is now doing amazing work in her new role as communica-tions director for Senator J
IMINHOFE , Republican, of Oklahoma. I know her parents, Greg and Denise Burke, and family members join me in recognizing her achievements. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our prayers are for all persons threat-ened by Hurricane Irma, from the Car-ibbean Islands to South Carolina.

LET US VOTE TO RESTORE OUR VALUES AND GIVE DREAMERS OPPORTUNITIES THEY DESERVE (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, Ana was an intern in my of-fice. She is also an undocumented im-migrant. When DACA was announced, Ana was ecstatic. She told me that DACA meant she could qualify for fi-nancial aid or be an intern at the State Department. All she saw were opportu-nities to contribute to our country, and that is exactly what she has done. Thanks to DACA, Ana earned her master’s degree and got a job helping other immigrants to lay roots and con-tribute, like she did. She was able to get a driver’s license to safely get to school and work. And today, she is at-tending law school. Ana represents the promise that if you come here, work here, and con-tribute here, you will have a future here. But Donald Trump is breaking that promise by ending DACA. And so it is up to us to fix it. The bi-partisan Dream Act will protect these DREAMers who are American in every way but on paper. Mr. Speaker, let us vote to restore our values and give these DREAMers the opportunities they deserve. CONGRATULATING INDIANA STATE SENATOR LUKE KENLEY (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Indiana’s State Senator Luke Kenley on his retire-ment, and to thank him for the many years he dedicated to serving our fel-low Hoosiers. From balancing the budget to re-forming State taxes, he has worked for 25 years to empower local communities and strengthen Indiana’s economy. He led important efforts to enhance our schools, roads, businesses, local insti-tutions, and more. Senator Kenley’s commitment to Hoosier common sense, and his tireless efforts to bring our State’s economy into the 21st century, helped transform Indiana and improve Hoosiers’ lives. I am grateful for Senator Kenley’s lead-ership and his keen understanding of the Hoosier values that are so impor-tant to our way of life. I have no doubt his impact on our State will last far into the future. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Indiana State Sen-ator Luke Kenley the absolute best as he embarks on this next chapter in life. f 
DACA AND PROTECTING DREAMERS (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permis-sion to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, when DACA was launched in 2012, it allowed nearly 800,000 young people to come out of the shadows and live without the constant fear of being deported. Some came here as infants in their parents’ arms. Some know no other language but English, and they know no other country but America. And all of them simply seek a better future. DACA helped breathe life into their American Dream. DREAMers are our neighbors, our friends, and our col-leagues. They grew up here. They have done absolutely nothing wrong. They are in school, they are working, and they are contributing to the American economy. And now, they must fear deportation once again. That is not the American Dream; that is not who we are. I hope that all of my colleagues will take that to heart so that we can fi-nally pass the Dream Act and keep these Americans out of the shadows, contributing to our economy, growing their lives, and helping live and be the American Dream.

RECOGNIZING PASTOR FRANK HAMPTON, JR. (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Frank Hampton, Jr., as he celebrates 50 years of ministry at the Church of God in Jackson, Michigan. Over the years, Pastor Hampton has been a steady example of what it means to be a father, a pastor, a men-tor, and a community servant. In addition to faithfully shepherding his congregation, Pastor Hampton has served as a volunteer chaplain for Alle-giance Health, counseled disadvan-taged youth, and helped build strong leaders in the community. He has worked in conjunction with Jackson’s judicial system, Jackson Public Schools, Jackson County Jail, and the Interfaith Shelter. The longevity of his service to his congregation and to the community is a reflection of his mission to make a profound difference in the lives of ev-eryone he meets. Pastor Hampton is a remarkable man of integrity, perseverance, and servant leadership. His 50 years of ministry have set the standard for our commu-nity. I congratulate him on his mile-stone and pray for God’s many bless-ings in the years ahead. f 
LET’S FIX DACA (Mr. CONNOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, Presi-dent Trump shielded Sheriff Joe Arpaio from a prison sentence for criminal contempt, despite Sheriff Arpaio’s record of illegal racial profiling and abuse directed at immigrant commu-nities. The President’s latest salvo in his war on immigrants is his tragic deci-sion to end the DACA program, which has given nearly 800,000 innocent DREAMers, who want to be Americans, the opportunity to work and attend school. In my native State of Virginia, we have more than 12,000 DREAMers, who contribute more than $711 million to our GDP every year—that is con-tribute. These young, hardworking DREAM-ers, who see themselves as Americans, as do I, are contributing to our commu-nities, creating jobs, serving in our military, teaching our children, and caring for our family members. Presi-dent Trump would learn that if he ever sat down with them, as I have, and so many of my colleagues have, and bro-ken bread with them, and listened to their fascinating, challenging, wonder-ful stories. Ending DACA is self-defeating, hurts the American economy, and neglects all that makes America unique. Let’s fix this.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Francis Bellamy, one of the most influ-ential individuals from Mount Morris, New York. Francis Bellamy is the au-thor of the Pledge of Allegiance. Tomorrow marks the 125th anniver-sary of the Pledge of Allegiance, which was first published in a magazine called The Youth’s Companion on Sep-tember 8, 1892. The pledge was initially written as part of a campaign to put American flags in every school in the country. In its original form, it read: ‘‘I pledge allegiance to my flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’’ In 1923, the words, ‘‘the flag of the United States of America’’ were added. In 1954, Congress added the words, ‘‘under God,’’ creating the 31-word pledge we have today. Bellamy’s words are recited millions of times every day and are ingrained in our society as an expression of national pride and patriotism.

CONGRESS MUST PASS LEGISLA-TION TO PROTECT DREAMERS (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is inhumane and unAmerican. Whatever your politics on immigra-tion, America’s DREAMers did not choose their birthplace or their path early in life. They are innocents, and they have grown up as Americans. They have attended school here along-side our own children. They share our values and our principles. They believe in the American Dream. Yes, deporting them hurts our econ-omy, and yes, it damages our standing as a leading nation, but at its heart, this is a matter of conscience. What kind of justice will we give to kids brought here when they were 6 years old, who grew up as Americans and who have no home beyond our shores? To make them the targets of deporta-tion is a violation of our national con-science. Congress must act now to pass legis-lation to protect these DREAMers. A just nation must not take lightly the judgment of the innocent. Let us not discard our friends and our neighbors for the sake of political theater, not when we can instead draw strength of heart and mind and treasure from their experience, their differences, and the many values we share in common. E pluribus unum. Out of many, we are indeed one. BRINGING ATTENTION TO MONTANA’S WILDFIRES (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the wildfires devastating Montana. My heart goes out to those affected by Hurricane Harvey. The disaster has shown the very best of our country, neighbor helping neighbor. That spirit is alive and well in Mon-tana, too, as we face a massive dis-aster. Drought conditions are severe. Over 40 wildfires continue to rage, and more than 900,000 acres have burned so far. As we speak, ash rains down on our homes and our schools, poor air quality threatens the health of Montanans, particularly our children and our elder-ly, and our livelihoods are at risk. This photo was taken just a few weeks ago from the south summit of Mount Sentinel as fires raged towards the town of Lolo, Montana. Sadly, this image is not unique. I met with leaders and firefighters at five wildfires this summer and wit-nessed the destruction firsthand. Mr. Speaker, I hope this image and others from back home will make my colleagues more aware of the fires, the devastation they have caused, and the need for relief in the Treasure State.

CONGRESS SHOULD PASS THE DREAM ACT (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the over 20,000 DREAMers in my district on the central coast of California. Due to the administration’s pledge to end DACA, those young men and women, who have done everything right after they got to America, are now being punished for a choice that they did not make before coming to America. Their mothers and fathers came to the central coast to work hard and con-tribute to the economies and commu-nities in the salad bowl of the world and the most scenic place in the world so that their children could have the opportunity to live the American Dream in the best country in the world. Now, it is clear that DACA doesn’t just give them that dream. All that DACA does is give those children the opportunity to come out of the shad-ows and fulfill that dream. That is why DREAMers work in our businesses, study in our schools, and serve in the military of the only country that they know. This is why Congress should vote on and pass the Dream Act. If we do our job, we will allow DREAMers to not only do their jobs, we will give them the opportunity to give back to the communities and country that gave them and their parents so much. As immigrants, they understand that obligation. Let’s show them and let’s show this country that Congress under-stands that obligation as well. f 
RECOGNIZING CLARION UNIVER-SITY’S 150TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Clarion University of Pennsylvania as it celebrates 150 years. In 1859, the people of Clarion County created a proposal for a higher edu-cation institution in Clarion. Shortly after, the Civil War erupted and dis-rupted the Nation, but it did not stop the determination of the Clarion peo-ple. On September 10, 1867, Clarion Uni-versity was founded as the Carrier Seminary of western Pennsylvania. With no facilities to call home, Carrier Seminary operated as a co-educational program in the old academy building, with Reverend James G. Townsend as principal. Carrier Seminary then became Clar-ion State Normal School in 1887. In 1915, the Commonwealth purchased the school, and it became a technical school of junior college rank in 1920. It opened its doors as a college-level institution in 1929. Since then, Clarion’s student body has grown to more than 5,000, its programs have re-ceived top level accreditation, and the institution has become a part of Penn-sylvania State System of Higher Edu-cation. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Clarion University on reaching this milestone, and I join all in celebrating its rich his-tory and contributions to our area.

AMERICA CAN BE A FAIR AND COMPASSIONATE NATION (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, last week I visited Norte Vista High School and stood before a room of DREAMers who were desperate to know if they have a future in America, the only country they have ever called home. I had to look each student in the eye and say: I can’t make any promises. The question is not whether we have enough votes in Congress to pass the Dream Act. We all know that we do. The question is not whether passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do. We all know that it is. The question before this Congress is whether we have the political courage and the basic decency to reject our worst impulses, and protect the most vulnerable members of our society. In a few months, I hope I can stand before that same room of DREAMers

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT AARON ALLAN AND DEPUTY CHIEF JIM WATERS (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor our Nation’s police officers, who sacrifice for their fellow citizens and selflessly put their lives on the line to keep our commu-nities safe. Sadly, in late July, right before our August recess, our community of cen-tral Indiana suffered terrible losses. While off duty, Indianapolis Metro-politan Police Deputy Chief Jim Waters was involved in an accident in-volving a semitrailer. He passed away a few days later on July 27. Deputy Chief Waters held almost every title in law enforcement in his lifetime, but he was proudest of the ti-tles of son, brother, father, and hus-band. No matter the job he took on, Deputy Chief Waters was known for working so hard, yet having fun while doing so. Also in late July, a second Indiana police officer was killed. When respond-ing to an overturned vehicle on Marion County’s south side, Southport Police Department’s Lieutenant Aaron Allan was fatally shot by the driver he was trying to assist in that overturned ve-hicle. He, too, passed away on July 27. He was the first Southport police offi-cer to be killed in the line of duty. As a child, Allan always knew what he wanted to be when he grew up: a po-lice officer. He had a compassionate heart and consistently went out of his way to help those in need, even if his job didn’t require it or he was off duty. I offer my deepest condolences to their families, the Southport and Indi-anapolis Metropolitan Police Depart-ments, and all who mourn their loss and cherish their memory.

HONORING DR. ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ BILLINGSLEA (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr. Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Billingslea of Orlando, who passed away on Friday, September 1. Dr. Billingslea was the founding ex-ecutive of Walt Disney’s Corporate Urban Affairs and Development depart-ment, and served as its vice president until his retirement in 2012. In this po-sition, he led the company’s minority outreach efforts, and was a firm be-liever that diversity drives growth, cre-ativity, and innovation. Bob’s unwavering commitment was evident by his service. He served on nu-merous organizations and boards, in-cluding Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Boys and Girls Clubs, and founded the Orlando Urban League, to name a few. When Bob walked into a room, people noticed; and when Bob spoke, people listened. Bob Billingslea was smart, impactful, and unforgettable. He made a difference. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allow-ing time for this tribute as we cele-brate the life of Dr. Bob Billingslea. f 
HONORING MISSOURI TASK FORCE 1 FOR THEIR COURAGE AND SELFLESSNESS (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the brave members of Missouri’s Task Force 1, who have risked their lives to help others in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Missouri’s Task Force 1 is one of 28 urban search and rescue teams in the country. Its 210 members are trained to provide emergency response and dis-aster relief services at a moment’s no-tice. Last week, as the rains came down and the waters came up in Houston, 47 members of the task force deployed to Texas with a mission: to turn potential stories of tragedy and despair into sto-ries of salvation and hope, and they succeeded. In just one day during Hurricane Harvey, the team made more than 300 water rescues and evacuations. De-ployed to Houston for 14 days, these skilled crewmembers risked their lives to save the lives of others in Houston. Now they are monitoring a possible new deployment to assist after Hurri-cane Irma. We should all keep in mind the con-tributions and rescue efforts of Task Force 1. Their courage and selflessness demonstrated the best of humanity in the worst of times. I want to thank them for putting their lives on the line to help others in their time of need. You are all worthy of our respect, appreciation, and honor.

b1230 CONGRESS MUST FIX OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Congress must act to fix our broken immigra-tion system, including passing legisla-tion to protect DREAMers. Like many Members of this body, I was deeply disappointed with the Presi-dent’s decision regarding DACA, to take away the promise of possibility that DACA provided young people who were brought to this country as chil-dren—many of them just months old— by their parents and have grown up here. They work here. They go to school here. They contribute to the quality, to the greatness of this coun-try. The one thing I did believe is right that the President said was that Con-gress ought to act. I have sat here and watched us name post offices, bring back legislation that we have passed in previous Congresses on suspension and brought them to the floor and debated them for hours. We have time in this House to stand up for 800,000 young people and give them hope that they deserve, to show that this country is as great as we say it is. When the Speaker was elected, he said he would open up the process. Here is my challenge: Bring the Dream Act to the floor of the House of Representa-tives. If you believe these DREAMers should be deported, then vote ‘‘no,’’ but give them a vote on the floor of this House. That is the moral thing to do, and we should do it now. f 
KEEP OUR GOVERNMENT FUNC-TIONING EFFICIENTLY AND EF-FECTIVELY (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act that the House is considering. This bill is a package of legislation that the Appropriations Committee has dili-gently worked on over the last several months that will fund our domestic and national security priorities. This is legislation that prioritizes conservative policies, invests in proven and effective programs, and reduces un-necessary and wasteful spending. It will fund the government in a fiscally responsible way, keeping a lid on spending as we have since taking the House majority in 2010. It will continue our work of rolling back burdensome, job-killing policies to help our economy grow even faster than we have seen over the last 7 months when we have added more than 1 million jobs. It includes many items that the House has already passed this summer, like the largest pay raise for our troops in 8 years and the most funding to care for our veterans in our Nation’s his-tory. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure to keep our gov-ernment functioning efficiently and ef-fectively for the American people.

CULTURE OF CORRUPTION AT WELLS FARGO (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, Wells Fargo is the Nation’s third largest bank, with nearly $2 tril-lion in assets. In the past several

months, Wells Fargo has engaged in blatant and systemic fraud perpetrated against millions of its own customers by opening fee-generating accounts without customer authorization, changing mortgage terms without cus-tomer knowledge, and forcing Wells Fargo auto loan customers into costly insurance products they did not need or want. Mr. Speaker, Wells Fargo has dem-onstrated a blatant, egregious culture of corruption, costing their customers tens of millions of dollars in unauthor-ized fees and financial hardship. Today I am calling on the Federal Housing Administration to ban, to im-mediately declare ineligible, Wells Fargo from participation in the Fed-eral mortgage guarantee program. Wells Fargo has violated its public trust and that of millions of its own customers and clients.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF FORMER CONGRESSMAN VERN EHLERS (Mr. AMASH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, with great sadness, the people of west Michigan learned of the recent passing of former Congressman Vern Ehlers. Vern was a humble man who served our community with honor. Early in his life, Vern moved to Grand Rapids to attend Calvin College. After earning his Ph.D. at Berkeley, he returned to help launch, and later chair, Calvin’s Physics Department. His passion for science, technology, and the environ-ment came to define his time at Calvin and tenure in Congress. In 1993, Vern was elected to Congress and served until his retirement in 2010. Vern was the first research physicist in Congress, and his impressive back-ground contributed to his many achievements. Vern was a member of the Commit-tees on Education and the Workforce; Science, Space, and Technology; and Transportation and Infrastructure. He served as chairman of the Committee on House Administration, and his por-trait now hangs in the committee’s main hearing room. I have staff who worked for Vern, and they all admired his compassion, inde-pendent thinking, and nonpartisan record. Colleagues often referred to him as ‘‘the smartest man in Con-gress.’’ Vern lived as commanded in Micah 6:8: ‘‘To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with Your God.’’ He placed his hands on this verse each time he was sworn in. Our community will endeavor always to honor his legacy. My deepest condolences go out to Vern’s wife, Johanna, his children and grandchildren, and to everyone whose lives he touched. May his memory be eternal. SUPPORT THE DREAMERS (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, today I rise in support of DREAM-ers. When I was just a baby, my parents brought me to this country because they sought freedom, opportunity, and a better life for our family. As a parent now, I know how they must have felt because I, too, would do anything for my children, no matter the risk. That parental instinct to give our children better opportunities than we had is universal and powerful. DREAMers were brought to this country as children by families who sought a better life. They were just kids and had no role in the decision to leave their native country, and they have done nothing wrong. They dem-onstrate one of our Nation’s most basic promises: the American Dream is available to anyone who is willing to work for it. The President’s decision this week to end DACA will tear families apart. Worse yet, it punishes children who have done nothing to deserve punish-ment. It is immoral and wrong. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you bring the Dream Act to the floor so we can enact an enduring solution for the 800,000 as-piring Americans who would be hurt by the President’s decision. 
f 
AMERICAN FAMILIES DESERVE ATTENTION AND SUPPORT (Mr. ROHRABACHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about DREAMers today, and we will continue to hear that. Let us note that we are talking about inviting millions of people to send their children to the United States, millions from around this hemisphere who live in poverty and oppression, and we are saying: If you can get your kids to the United States, they are going to be taken care of. We have limited resources here, lim-ited in the Federal Government. Our people of every race and every religion and every ethnic group that make up the American family deserve to know that we are caring about them—I am sorry—rather than the children in other countries that come here ille-gally. We can expect a flood of new young people if we legalize this, and they will be consuming the healthcare dollars. They will be consuming the education dollars that should go to American children. This is not being selfish by saying take care of your family first. The American family deserves our atten-tion and our support. We should not be extracting resources, bidding down their wages, extracting the resources of education and healthcare for people who have come here illegally and in-vite more people to flood into our country. No, the DREAMers concept is a nightmare for American young people. f 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF JAMES ANDREWS (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor James Andrews, president of the North Carolina AFL–CIO. After four decades of service, James will be retiring on September 15. He has been a leader since a young age, and while serving our country in Vietnam, he earned a Purple Heart for his brave service. Upon his return, James organized fel-low workers at a plant in Henderson, North Carolina, before joining the AFL–CIO in 1974 as a director of Frontlash, an AFL–CIO youth group. Just a year later, the AFL–CIO recog-nized James’ dedication to the fight for fair working conditions and promoted him to outreach director for the North Carolina federation, making him the first African American to hold a paid, full-time staff position with the State AFL–CIO federation. After a brief stint working for his union in 1982, he began his position as the treasurer and secretary for North Carolina’s AFL–CIO. A little over a decade later, James was elected as president and became the first African American to lead a State federation. As his service draws to a close, we want to both congratulate and honor him for his unparalleled work on behalf of North Carolina’s hardworking fami-lies. James, congratulations, and thank you for your hard work.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF KENDRA MURRAY ADAMS (Ms. MOORE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life of Mrs. Kendra Murray Adams, a loving mother, a wife, daughter, sister, and friend to many, myself included. I first got to know Kendra when she joined my office in 2005 as an executive assistant. She was a blonde bombshell who was quick-witted, strong-willed, but just as quick to laugh with you and at you, if needed. Effortlessly funny and graciously caring, it was a joy to get to know her and to have a front row seat to see how this marvelous young lady lived life. Even now, I struggle to find the words to convey how much of a joy and honor it was to know Kendra and to be known by Kendra. Whether you knew her for years, or just got to meet her, you got the best

of her from minute one. Kendra may have left my office, but she never left my heart. Sadly, at the end of July, Kendra lost her battle with cancer at the tender age of 39. And although my heart is heavy, I am recalling the final words written by Kendra before her death, where she urged those who loved her to not mourn, but to ‘‘live life, to go to the beach, go rock climbing, skydiving, do what you want to do.’’ This exempli-fies her spirit, her courage, and her life which, unfortunately, ended too soon. Kendra is survived by her beloved twins, her husband, her father, her sis-ter, and my thoughts and prayers are with her and her family and friends. I loved her dearly, and I will miss her deeply and will always remember her.

PROTECTING DACA (Ms. LEE asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 800,000 DREAMers in our Nation, 200,000 in my State of California. Now, these DREAMers are students, entrepreneurs, volunteers, and neigh-bors. They go to school, they work, and they pay taxes. They are young men and women like my constituent, Karem, a DREAMer who recently grad-uated from the University of California at Berkeley. Karem now works as a paralegal, helping people like herself navigate our complicated immigration system. Karem came to America when she was only 3 years old. In a message to my office, she wrote: ‘‘The United States is all I’ve ever known.’’ I have to tell you, she is as American as I am. Forcing Karem or any hard-working DREAMer out of this country or back into the shadows is heartless and un-American. This is her home. Deporting DREAMers from the only country they have ever known is an ex-treme betrayal of our values. We care about family values. Ending DACA breaks families up. Let me be clear: Now President Trump has turned his back on these in-nocent young people. Now it is up to Congress to have the courage to do the right thing. I call on Speaker R
YANto bring up the bipartisan and bicameral Dream Act now.

PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSID-ERATION OF H.R. 3354, DEPART-MENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVI-RONMENT, AND RELATED AGEN-CIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, by di-rection of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 504 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their re-marks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, it is going to be a good day. It is going to be a good day. I don’t know if you came down to Washington as a young man. I remem-ber sitting right up there on the second row of the gallery, and I came into the Chamber and I was so excited. It was my first visit to see the people’s House. The Reading Clerk was standing there at that podium and read and read. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, and here nobody hands you a pamphlet or anything to tell you what is happening on the floor of the House. I thought the activity was going to happen down here, and it was all going on up there at the podium. That has been 40 years ago now. I now see that however long that con-versation happens, it lays the ground-work for what is going to be an even greater conversation here on the floor of the House. Mr. Speaker, I am fond of saying that if you come to this institution on the right day, you are going to see a fes-tival of democracy take place right here. Today is going to be one of those days. If you were on the House floor yester-day, you saw us take up the first of these divisions in this appropriations bill. Today, because of the work that my friend from New York and I did with the rest of the members of the Rules Committee right up there last night, we are bringing to the floor the remaining four divisions of H.R. 3354; 224 additional amendments. 224 addi-tional amendments. Division A is the Interior section; division C is the Com-merce, Justice, Science section; divi-sion D is the Financial Services sec-tion; division F is the Labor, HHS, and Education section. When I was on the floor yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I talked about how proud I was of the work that we have all done here together. This annual appropria-tions process has been conducted in a more comprehensive fashion this year than in any other year in my memory. When we get jammed, you end up with one of those long-term, yearlong continuing resolutions that shut out every Member’s voice. In a good year, maybe, you end up with one of those giant leadership-negotiated White House and the leader of the House and the Senate omnibus appropriations bills that shut out all but two or three voices. This year, the Appropriations Com-mittee, beginning its work way back in April, has worked through every single appropriations bill one by one at the committee level, and we are seeing the culmination of that effort here on the floor today. Mr. Speaker, it has been since 2010 that the House has finished its work before the September 30 fiscal year deadline. It was the 2009 calendar year. They were doing the work for the 2010 fiscal year. It is hard to get this done, and it doesn’t happen because Demo-crats are successful or Republicans are

successful. It happens because the col-laboration that we have together is successful, and we are seeing the result of that today. If we pass the underlying rule, we will make in order those 224 amend-ments, we will begin that process of de-bating the last four divisions, and we will have the voices of this House heard. We went until midnight last night, Mr. Speaker. We went until midnight the night before that. I suspect mid-night is going to seem early to us where we are headed over the next cou-ple of days. But at the end of that proc-ess, Republicans, Democrats, folks from all regions of the country, are going to be able to look each other in the eye and know that—in a way that makes folks back home proud—we worked through each and every appro-priations bill and we got our work done on time. That is why I ran for Congress, Mr. Speaker, to deliver results back home, and that is why I am proud to be stand-ing with my friend from New York today delivering on those promises. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, what is happening with the appropriations bills is unprece-dented. After passing four appropria-tions bills earlier this year, we are now considering the remaining eight appro-priations bills this week in 2 days. That means that we are debating the funding for roughly two-thirds of dis-cretionary Federal spending bills in just over 4 days. Has any Member here really had the time to read all 1,035 pages of these eight bills? Better yet, has anyone had time to read nearly all the thousand amendments and determine what the impact of each one would be? This is the appropriations process we are talking about; the process that used to take us days and weeks and was perfectly open so that all Members of the House were able to propose amend-ments on the floor. These are the bills that fund programs that impact the life of every American every single day. But we are not giving them any seri-ous consideration they deserve, and the minority has been virtually, literally, I would say, shut out of the process alto-gether. When the majority took control of Congress and the White House, they promised regular order. They have not only broken that promise, they have shattered it and stomped on it. Speak-er R
YANis the only speaker in the his-tory of tracking statistics to never have had a truly open rule. An open rule would allow any Mem-ber to offer an amendment that com-plies with the standing rules of the House and the Budget Act. Not a single one. A bad process, I believe, will lead to a bad product, and these bills are no exception. They are full of provisions that would do real harm to millions of Americans. Inside these bills, the Dodd-Frank fi-nancial reform law, passed in the wake of the biggest recession since the Great Depression, would be tattered. The big-gest banks still in control of the people who got us in trouble in the first place would be allowed to run roughshod over the economy again, paving the way for another Great Recession or worse. Try as we could to find out what would be the substitute for Dodd-Frank to prevent them from doing that again, there is no answer they would be able to do it. Under Dodd-Frank, we have had a record-setting streak of more than 80 consecutive months of private sector job growth. Mr. Speaker, this growth didn’t come despite this law; it came because of it. There is also language here that would ramp up the majority’s assault on women’s health; provisions that would zero out funding for Title X, the Nation’s only Federal program devoted to family planning. More than 4 mil-lion women depend on it for access to contraception. The bills would also eliminate fund-ing for Planned Parenthood, which serves 2.5 million women and men every year. It is relied on not just for contraception, but for services like breast cancer screenings, wellness vis-its, and STI testing. The bills would be truly destructive if they ever became law. They don’t ap-pear to have the necessary votes to pass the Senate, since there are not 60 Senators willing to vote for this legis-lation, and that would make one won-der why are we even going through this charade, because we have only 9 legis-lative days left in the month of Sep-tember. During those 9 days, we need to raise the debt ceiling to pay the bills we have already incurred, to fund the government for the following year, to reauthorize the Children’s Health In-surance Program; the Perkins Loan Program, which many low-income stu-dents rely on for their college edu-cation; and, very importantly, the Fed-eral Aviation Administration. All of those expire on September 30. We also need to address the National Flood Insurance Program, which, on its current course, faces a shortfall of more than $25 billion. And that will ex-pire at the end of this month. We all know the horror of going through Hur-ricane Harvey, and now Irma, and with two more, as I understand it, starting their aim at us in the Atlantic. If we are going to do all of this, we have to get back to the orderly and thoughtful process. Congress can’t wait for a disaster to always be at its door-step before acting. We need to abandon legislation by chaos or emergency, which we often do for something that we could have done by scheduling. Two-thirds of the discretionary spending bills considered in a single week is absurd and irresponsible, and I would doubt has ever taken place be-fore in the House of Representatives. It is time we took control of the House and got back to regular order, which we talk about all the time, but hardly anybody remembers. We hope for a bet-ter day, and we hope for it soon. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My friend is absolutely right, there is a lot of work to get done. That is why we both ran for Congress, to get that work done. I am incredibly optimistic that we will get that work done. I wish from time to time we would celebrate our successes as fiercely as we observe our failures. My friend is absolutely right, there was a time in congressional history where appropria-tions bills came to the floor and any Member could offer any amendment they wanted at any time, and the proc-ess could go on for days or weeks or months. To my friend’s point, we can remi-nisce about those days and celebrate them, but we can’t do it at the same time we observe the very limited dead-lines that we have now trying to get work done. It was back on August 24 that the Rules Committee created a deadline and said: We want to have every Mem-ber have their voice heard. We want to hear from every single Member on every single appropriations bill to un-derstand what it is you would do dif-ferently to have the bills serve Amer-ica better. We created that deadline, Mr. Speak-er, for exactly the reason my friend from New York suggested, and that is so folks would have the time to look at those amendments, to digest those amendments, to be thoughtful about those amendments. Now, it turns out even in a body of 435 Members, you can have some repet-itive ideas. It turns out a lot of us think a single amendment is a good idea. The Rules Committee looked at amendments and found multiple Mem-bers had exactly the same idea. In order to speed the process along, we let one of those Members offer the amend-ment; we asked the other Members not to. That is not closing down the process. That is a good use of the American peo-ple’s time, because we have so much that we must get done together. Mr. Speaker, for folks who care about openness—and I am one of those Mem-bers—I just want to remind you that it is not just the 1,000-plus amendments we looked at in the Rules Committee. It is thousands upon thousands that were worked through the Appropria-tions Subcommittee process, and then the Appropriations full committee process. b1300 The appropriations process is one of the best opportunities for any Member

in this Chamber to make their prior-ities known, act on those priorities, change the law of the land for the men and women they serve back home. Every single Member of this Chamber knows of that process, avails them-selves of that process, and if we pass this rule, we will make several hundred more amendments in order and com-plete this process for the first time since 2009. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. R
OSEN ). Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am dis-gusted by House Republicans’ contin-ued efforts to end DACA and help this heartless administration tear families apart. Yesterday, House Republicans had a chance to rectify the Trump Ad-ministration’s despicable decision to betray DREAMers in Nevada and across this country. Instead, they chose to block the im-mediate consideration of the bipartisan Dream Act. And then last night, House Republicans in the Rules Committee doubled down on this President’s cow-ardly assault on DREAMers by block-ing an amendment that I helped file with my colleagues J
ULIA BROWNLEY  and L
UISCORREA . That would have prohibited funds from being used to deport DACA recipi-ents. In Nevada, DACA has allowed more than 13,000 young people to come forward, pass background checks, and live and work legally. These young men and women who are brought here as children are patriotic and brave. They include college students, mem-bers of our military, and so many oth-ers who are contributing to our soci-ety. They fear they will be taken from their homes and their families torn apart. President Trump’s decision to end DACA is an affront to everything our Nation stands for and only cements his legacy of shortsighted cruelty. House Republicans ought to be ashamed of themselves for helping this administration push DREAMers one step closer to deportation. I will con-tinue to fight for our values, our prin-ciples, because as Americans, we do not turn our backs on people who represent the best of our Nation. We must take the Dream Act up without delay. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. P
ALMER ). Members are reminded to re-frain from engaging in personalities to-ward the President. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. R
OHRABACHER ), one of our leaders from the great State of Cali-fornia. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank you very much for providing me this time. I rise in opposition to this rule, which prohibits a vote of the House of Representatives on an amend-ment that would prevent the Depart-ment of Justice from using its power and resources to supersede all State laws that have legalized the medical use of cannabis. For 3 years, States have been shield-ed from having the will of their voters and their people by a prohibition on the Department of Justice that would prevent the Department of Justice from thwarting the will of the people of the States by superceding those State laws when they have determined in the States that the medical use of mari-juana should be permitted with their citizens. The Rules Committee has, thus, been basically—it will be changing the law of the land for 3 years where the 50 States have been permitted, if they so chose, to have the medical use of mari-juana. After this vote, because of this rule, we have been prevented from again pro-viding that prohibition that passed this House on a number of occasions that would prohibit the Department of Jus-tice from superceding State law. In short, a vote for this rule is anti- States’ rights. A vote for this rule is against permitting the people of your State to legalize the medical use of marijuana if the Federal Government, if the DOJ, decides. A vote for this rule will, thus, pre-vent medical use of cannabis by our doctors in States that would like to permit their people to benefit from il-legal use of medical marijuana. In-stead, those doctors now will, as they have been, prescribing opiates. That is right, opiates. Our people have ended up being prescribed opiates because marijuana has not been an option. It is a vote to cut off our veterans, and our seniors with arthritis, those people who have children who are plagued with seizures, all of these things now are permitted in the States where they have legalized the medical use of marijuana. These people are pro-vided an avenue to at least try this as a method of dealing with these horrible maladies that they have to deal with in their lives, whether they are seizures, or whether they are people who have arthritis, or whether they are our vet-erans who are coming back. We need to make sure that the bil-lions of dollars that right now are being invested in medical marijuana businesses and clinics throughout our country, those billions of dollars will go to the benefit of our people. Instead, this rule prevents us from standing in the way of the Justice Department from obliterating those rights in the States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WOODALL. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-fornia. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, so a vote against this rule is a vote to per-mit those States to make that deci-sion. The rule, as it is now, prevents us from getting in the way of the Justice Department’s obliteration of these rights. But one of the most important things, whether it is States’ rights, or whether it is trying to listen to the seniors who are begging for us to give them some relief from some of their suffering and let them at least try this if the doctors so prescribe, but let us just remember this: that billions of dollars, $3 billion or $4 billion have been invested in this industry to pro-vide honest businessmen and doctors the right to try medical marijuana on some of these maladies. Those $3 billion will immediately be transferred to the drug cartels in Mex-ico if this rule goes through. That is what it means. Now, I would suggest that whether it is opiates, or the drug lords down in Mexico, we need to side with the States’ rights to make this determination and decide—and to make our determination to let the peo-ple decide in those States and let them have the choice there. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule for those reasons. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act, this bipartisan, bicameral legislation. We have thousands of young people who are Americans in every way except on paper. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-sent to insert the text of my amend-ment in the RECORD , along with extra-neous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentle-woman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. C
ARBAJAL ) to dis-cuss our proposal. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, in the past 5 years, the DACA program has given nearly 800,000 young men and women who came here as children, and have only known the United States as their home, a shot at the American Dream. It rightfully allowed them to come forward to live, work, and learn in the United States legally, and with-out fear of deportation. President Trump, this week, made his most heartless decision yesterday by cruelly rescinding DACA protection for these young DREAMers. These DREAMers now face the painful reality of a President betraying their trust, forcing them back into the shadows, and kicking them out of their homes. These kids put their faith in our gov-ernment to protect them. They under-went rigorous background checks and paid the required fees, all for an oppor-tunity to better themselves and their communities. And we are failing them. I share a similar story as many of these DREAMers. I emigrated to the United States with my parents as a 5- year-old boy from Mexico. This great country since has given me the oppor-tunity to work hard, raise my two chil-dren, and serve my country in local

government, the military, and here in Congress. Terminating DACA and stripping DREAMers of that same hope and op-portunity is unconscionable and incom-patible with our American values. We are a nation of immigrants and are made stronger by their contributions. Following the President’s shameful de-cision this week, Congress must take action and pass the bipartisan Dream Act which would provide a permanent legislative solution to allow DREAM-ers to remain in the United States and continue to contribute to our Nation’s future. They are our neighbors, our chil-dren’s classmates, our coworkers. These are all hardworking and law- abiding individuals. We cannot afford to abandon DACA recipients who have lived in America all of their lives and contribute to this country in many ways. Ending this program undermines our economic growth and competitiveness, costing our economy $490 billion in lost GDP over the next decade, in addition to losing potential innovation and en-trepreneurship. This House has already passed the DREAM Act in 2010, and a majority of Senators also supported this legisla-tion. However, it fell short with a fili-buster from then-Senator Jeff Sessions, the same Attorney General who an-nounced the termination of DACA this week. This Congress must now ensure the well-being and future of these 800,000 youth living and working in the United States. I urge my colleagues to stand up for DREAMers by bringing H.R. 3440, the bipartisan Dream Act, imme-diately to the floor for a vote. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I appre-ciate that admonition. As my friends all know, the truth is, the vote in the Senate was a bipartisan vote against the consideration of that bill. We are going to find a bipartisan so-lution to this difficult problem and continuing to characterize this as a partisan issue does nothing but harm to our shared cause. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. R
OBY), one of the great leaders of the big freshman class in 2010. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the Make America Secure and Pros-perous Appropriations Act, and I en-courage my colleagues to support this rule. As a pro-life conservative, I have long fought to make sure that tax-payers’ dollars aren’t being used to fund abortions or to fund abortion pro-viders. Whether it is in the Appropria-tions Committee or here on the House floor, I have repeatedly made the cause for increasing protections for life under the law. Those fights haven’t always been easy, and we haven’t won every time. But Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the appropriations bill before us does contain important pro-life provi-sions. First, the bill states: ‘‘None of the funds made available by this act may be used to conduct or support research using human fetal tissue if such tissue is obtained pursuant to an induced abortion.’’ We all remember the 2015 scandal that revealed how Planned Parenthood officials were systematically altering abortion procedures in order to pre-serve the organs of babies to sell them to researchers. I said it at that time, and you don’t have to be staunchly pro- life like me to be appalled by the thought of harvesting and trafficking aborted babies’ body parts for profit. Our bill will prevent these atrocities from removing any incentives abortion providers might have to harvest and sell babies’ organs. Instead, the bill di-rects agencies to find research using modern, more efficient alternatives to human fetal tissue. To be clear, I am a strong supporter of the National Institutes of Health. Their research is critical for develop-ment of lifesaving medical break-throughs. However, I believe we must set a clear line of distinction between what is acceptable and what is not. Second, the bill expressly prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from steering Title X public health funding to abortion providers. Of course, the Hyde amendment has long made it against the law to actu-ally pay for abortions with taxpayer dollars. But the Obama administration had a bad habit of pushing hundreds of millions of dollars to Planned Parent-hood in forms of grants and reimburse-ments for other services. This amounts to a pipeline of funding propping up the Nation’s largest abortion provider. It is an abuse of taxpayer money, and I am pleased that this bill cuts it off. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my chair-man, TOMCOLE, for including these im-portant pro-life provisions in our base bill for the first time. b1315 It represents real progress for the pro-life movement, and I will continue to fight to see it through the process. Mr. Speaker, I am unapologetically pro-life, and I believe that every human life is precious and our laws and policies should reflect that. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L
EE), a distin-guished member of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank our ranking member for yielding and, really, for her tireless advocacy on behalf of all Americans. I rise in strong opposition to this rule and the underlying bill, the so- called Make America Secure and Pros-perous Appropriations Act. Mr. Speaker, let’s make one thing clear: this bill breaks Republicans’ promise to get back to regular order, while blocking the majority of amend-ments to be considered on the floor. Also, as an African-American woman, I can’t help but see how these cuts im-pact communities of color. It may be easy to think of budgets in terms of dollar signs and decimal points, but the disturbing truth is that the decisions we make here affect lives. If we are honest, many of these deci-sions in this bill disproportionately af-fect Black and Brown lives. For instance, the bill eliminates the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative, the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Communities Health Program—just eliminates it—and Title X family plan-ning, which many women of color and men rely on. It eliminates the Health and Career Opportunities Program, which provides training and grants for health careers for minority-serving in-stitutions, and it eliminates the Minor-ity AIDS Initiative, just to name a few. These are just under the Health and Human Services provision. This bill cuts $3 billion from the Pell Grant Surplus Program, $190 million in 21st Century Community Schools, and eliminates the comprehensive literacy program. All of these are critical edu-cation programs that predominantly help people and students of color. I am also disappointed that this bill divests in our workforce, especially for communities of color, by eliminating the proven apprenticeship programs and cutting millions of our Nation’s job training programs, including re-integration of ex-offenders—again, ma-jority African-American and Latino ex- offenders—reentering into society. This budget cuts millions from that. It refuses to make in order Congress-man BOBBY SCOTT’s amendment to strike the prohibition against using Federal funds for transportation to de-segregate public schools. We are talk-ing, still, about desegregating public schools in 2017. What is worse, I offered an amend-ment in Rules to combat these dev-astating cuts to communities of color, and Republicans refused to make them in order. I offered an amendment that would have prohibited funds from being used to implement the policy memo that Attorney General Sessions has presented that rolls back the failed War on Drugs and reinstates the harshest sentences for low-level drug offenses, the majority of whom—guess what—are African Americans. I offered another amendment that would have expressed the sense of Con-gress that race-conscious admissions policies, which are designed to achieve a more diverse student body, which al-lows for the use of race as one factor, only one factor, in admissions—these policies, we have to remember, are ben-eficial to all students. So the Depart-ment of Justice should not take action to limit these benefits. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH7110 September 7, 2017 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have re-maining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tlewoman from New York has 16 min-utes remaining. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 1 minute. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding another minute. Mr. Speaker, we should not be trying to limit students of color access to edu-cation, which the Justice Department is trying to do. Affirmative action is critical to mitigating discriminatory practices that prevent students of color from being admitted into the schools of their choice. Attorney General Ses-sions needs to back off of this. I tried to do this through an amendment to send that message. Of course, that amendment was not made in order. Congress can help, though, renew their faith in minority communities, and the minority communities can renew their faith in Congress by not accepting this Trump agenda and sup-port clear policies that demonstrate to people of color that our lives also mat-ter in America. Unfortunately, this spending bill does just the opposite. So I hope the Members will under-stand the message that we are sending to communities of color. I just men-tioned a few of the cuts that have been put into this bill. I hope that we work to rectify the problems with it. It is past time to get back to regular order. It is past time to move each bill individually, also. It is past time to make strong investments in the Amer-ican people, which include people of color. It is past time to help grow the economy and to create good-paying jobs for everyone. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule and ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill. There is simply too much at stake. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to associate my-self with the comments of my friend from California. She is absolutely right. When Republicans took control of this Chamber, they committed themselves to having a more open proc-ess. I was a part of that freshman class that came in to give Republicans a ma-jority, and we have made good on that process. I want to talk about that just for a little bit. My friend from California serves on the Appropriations Committee, and I thank her for her service, Mr. Speaker. When you want to talk about an open process, that Appropriations Com-mittee went through every single bill one subcommittee at a time, hour after hour, day after day, week after week, indeed, month after month. I am grate-ful to her for that service. The bill would not be as good as it is but for the men and women who serve on the Ap-propriations Committee. But I mentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker, that one of the reasons I was proud to be carrying the rule today is that we haven’t gotten the appropriations proc-ess completed on time since Demo-cratic leadership was able to achieve that back in 2009. They couldn’t do it in their last year in power, 2010. In fact, they didn’t do the appropriations bills at all. They punted it off to the next Republican Congress. But in 2009 they did. When I talk about that commitment to openness, let’s remember, last time we had this shared success together and my friends on the other side of the aisle were leading, they allowed 17 amendments to the Financial Services bill. We are allowing twice that many today. When my friends were leading this institution the last time we completed this process, they allowed 13 amend-ments to the Interior bill. We are al-lowing six times that many. When my friends on the other side of the aisle were leading this institution, the last time we successfully com-pleted this process, they allowed five amendments to the Labor-HHS. We are allowing 10 times that many. When my friends on the other side of the aisle were leading this institution, the last time we successfully com-pleted this process on time, they al-lowed zero amendments to the Com-merce-Justice-Science bill. We allow 49—infinitely more. My friends, can we always do better together? We can. I am grateful to my friends for the hard work they put in showing up day after day to do that better. But this bill is better, and if we pass this rule, we will move to the de-bate on this bill, and we will complete this process on time in the most open fashion that any of my colleagues have seen in decades. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. I am really very fond of my colleague over there, and I appreciate his won-derful sunshine attitude. The fact is we have never seen any-thing like what we are going through now. Twice, in just the last few months, one amendment by Ms. L
EE, to finally get an AUMF so that we could authorize the wars that seem to be going on forever in the name of the United States of America was voted on in committee, passed in committee, and should have been in the bill. Lo and behold, it disappeared. I don’t think we ever did anything like that to my knowledge, and if we did, shame on us. In this very bill today, there was, again, an amendment presented in committee for the DACA people to be able to get jobs while they are waiting with the Federal Government. I am paraphrasing that because I never saw it, but that is my understanding of what that did. Once again, it was pre-sented at the committee, voted, passed, and should have been in this bill. But before it got to Rules, just like Ms. L
EE’s amendment, it just disappeared. How can you run the Government of the United States by saying that the people do their will through us? We are not sitting here to represent ourselves and do what we want to do and take one from column A and one from col-umn B. We follow rules. That is what we are supposed to do. We have to an-swer for that. I want the people of the United States to know that what we are talk-ing about here today is probably not going anywhere. As far as we know, it will not get past the Senate. Now, some miracle may happen. Who knows? Or maybe the whole thing will dis-appear—I don’t know—with no expla-nation, by the way. But we haven’t really done anything here yet except what I would call a crazy amalgamation of what the rules of the House wouldn’t even come close to allowing us to do. Any body, any Congress, any House of Representa-tives, any legislature anywhere can do what they have to do to get their budg-et ready if they throw it all in one mix and let one committee, the Appropria-tions Committee, do it. The other com-mittees had no right to talk about it. As I pointed out, again, the majority has really cut out the minority com-pletely. Do you think we knew before it got to Rules that those two amend-ments that I talked about that were terribly important had disappeared? We didn’t know that until it was given to us. Many times what we get at Rules are emergency meetings, which means one thing: no committee action. We have decided we would like to do this one this week, so let’s call it an emergency. Enough. Enough already. This is the premier legislative body in the world. The hopes, the dreams, and the aspira-tions of all Americans lie in this House. We do or we do not do what is in the best interests of the people who sent us here. I promise you it is not in the best interests to cut out all of the population of the United States—about half, almost half. In fact, I believe nu-merically we got more votes than the other side—just cut us out of the proc-ess. I have already talked about no open rules. If you can’t have an open rule whereby you can talk about amend-ments, there is nothing else for you to do. We are out of it because Democrats get very few amendments. I don’t think the Rules Committee people get hardly any at all, and then we beg for some of the best ones we would like to be made into order—never happens. We are pretty discouraged. As a mat-ter of fact, we were talking about maybe we should stage a coup, but I know that is illegal and would not work in the United States of America. So it was kind of a fleeting thought brought about by pure frustration. Mr. Speaker, Mr. SCOTT had a won-derful amendment. He is the ranking member on the Education and the Workforce Committee and is known throughout the United States for the

work that he does, as is B ARBARA LEE, who is probably more well known than almost any other Member of this House. To be treated that way, to have to go back to her district and say, ‘‘Well, we tried to do these amend-ments’’—enough already. We can do it the right way. We used to. When I got here, it was entirely dif-ferent. The bipartisanship was strong. We all liked each other. It was a pretty wonderful thing. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. S
COTT), whose amendments should have been allowed. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman for yield-ing. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the number of amendments that were made in order by the Rules Committee, but I am appalled that the majority chose not to include one of my amendments, No. 63, to division F of H.R. 3354, which would strike a prohibition against using Federal funds for the purpose of transportation needed to desegregate public schools. This language has found its way into every appropriations act since at least 1974. The language in sections 301 and 302 of division F of the bill really represent a relic of an ugly history when States and school districts across the Nation resisted meaningful integration of pub-lic education for decades after the Su-preme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. That resistance has worked. According to the GAO last year, our schools are more segregated by race and class today than they were in 1968. The persistence of these riders, if un-challenged, is morally reprehensible and has no place in 2017. I stand with the Congressional Black Caucus in calling for a total removal of this of-fensive language in any fiscal 2018 ap-propriations act. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We have a long and proud history in this House, but it is sometimes tough to remember exactly how that history goes, Mr. Speaker. b1330 My friend from New York has her picture up on the wall in the Rules Committee room. If you haven’t been up there, Mr. Speaker, you should go see it. My friend from New York is the first woman to have ever led the United States House of Representatives Rules Committee. She led it ably and proudly for the 4 years that the Democrats were in the majority the last decade. It is a hard job because, as the chair-man of the Rules Committee or the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, you have to make decisions. When the bills come to you from the committees of jurisdiction—the authorizing com-mittees—you often have to completely reorganize those bills. You have to meld those bills together. It is a power-ful committee because it has a solemn responsibility. Yes, in the area of Rules Committee jurisdiction and the melding of all of those pieces of legislation is what amendments get added and what amendments get taken away. My friend from California (Ms. LEE), has an absolutely legitimate gripe, as does my friend from Virginia (Mr. S
COTT). Mr. Speaker, we all think our amendments are the greatest amend-ments to be known. Mr. S
COTT led, to his credit, with say-ing: I am glad so many of my amend-ments were made in order, but I am ap-palled my one amendment was kept out. We all want all of our amendments in. But to my friend from New York’s comment that Democrats don’t get a fair shake, I will remind you, Mr. Speaker, when my friend was leading the committee, the entire House of Representatives was offered 139 chances to change the appropriations bill in 2009, the last time we completed it. With P
AULRYANleading the institu-tion, with my friend from Texas, Pete Sessions, leading the Rules Committee, we made 214 Democratic amendments in order. We have made more minority amendments in order in this process than my friends on the other side made in order for the entire House. Mr. Speaker, we have nothing to fear from openness. We have nothing to fear from a robust debate. I am so glad that we have had a chance to do that. But history should be reported accurately. The accuracy is: we can always do bet-ter. But we are doing better today than we were just a few short years ago. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, we are really getting somewhere here. What my colleague failed to say is, as far as I know and I imagine as far as he knows, that no committee has ever sent a bill to the Rules Committee completely taking away amendments that had passed in that committee and were legitimately a part of that bill. In just the last, let’s say, 2 or 3 months, two amendments legitimately passed by Democratic members in the proper committee disappeared between that committee and the Rules Com-mittee. If that is not a violation of rules, I don’t know how in the world you would ever describe it. Sure, we had a lot of open rules—I mentioned P
AUL RYAN has never had one—which gave everybody an oppor-tunity to do an amendment, all 435 us, if we chose to, but we don’t. When you talk about something coming to us from a committee, large bills some-times don’t come to us from commit-tees, but oftentimes they are written somewhere—we are not sure where— but they come to us in an emergency procedure because they have to get to the floor that week. I am not just talking about improv-ing. I am talking about following the rules of procedure laid down by his-tory, by circumstance, and by geniuses. I am talking about not appropriating those in ways that say: We just don’t want that amendment on the list. Pre-tend it never happened. Throw it in the garbage and maybe nobody will re-member it. We remember. We think that some amendments are a few things that would really move the country for-ward, and we don’t have a chance to get them put in place simply because we are the minority. That is absolutely wrong. It is undemocratic. It is hurtful to the institution and hurtful to Amer-ica. We can do better. You and I should pledge right now to work on that. I am game if you are. Mr. WOODALL. Will the gentle-woman yield? Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield to the gen-tleman from Georgia. Mr. WOODALL. I will say to my friend that I have no better days than the days that you and I are working to-gether. I absolutely look forward to that. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Reclaiming my time, I don’t want to see that anymore. It is an embarrassment when I have to even get up to do my half of the rule and talk about what awful things have happened to us. There are more things that I need to talk about than that. I think we should cut out the games and the cuteness and all the rest of it and do our job. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICH-
MOND ). Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today, as a Member of the United States House of Representatives, em-barrassed. At the same time that I am embarrassed, I am also dumbfounded. I know that there are people at home that are thinking: Why would a Mem-ber of Congress, the most prestigious body in the world, be embarrassed, dumbfounded? Well, I was always taught that if you show me your budget or if you show me your legislation, then you are showing me your values. Representative S
COTT, my good friend from Virginia, had an amend-ment that would strike the prohibition that Federal funds could be used to de-segregate our public schools in this country. If you look at the GAO study, there are more schools now that are deseg-regated than in 1968. We can talk elo-quently about the history of the House and what the Democrats did when they were in control and how many amend-ments were made in order. I am not talking about how many amendments. I am talking about a specific amend-ment, a specific issue. We are perpetuating segregation in the United States of America in our

public schools. We are not allowing the States to use funds to promote integra-tion and diversity among our schools. My State—and I will own this—is still the only State under a Federal de-segregation order, because we have not completely desegregated our schools. We still have that ugly history. With everything going on in this country and school kids probably huddled around a TV right now watch-ing this institution work and they are saying: These are our leaders? We elected them to run this country? Why wouldn’t they want me to go to school with other kids of other races? That is why I am embarrassed. It is wrong. I don’t think we should just hide behind procedure, but address the issue and the moral failure and the message that we are sending to our children. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend from New York that I do not have other speakers remaining, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. These bills don’t have the support they need to pass the Senate. It takes 60 votes to even bring them to the floor. That means that this entire exer-cise this week has been an exercise in futility. All the while, the clock is ticking and Congress has so much to do, as I have elaborated several times this afternoon, over the next 9 legisla-tive days. If this process has been good for any-thing, it is revealing just how broken the legislative process has become under the majority’s rule. Legislation regularly comes to the House floor without any committee consideration. It just goes to rules. The majority even rammed through a healthcare repeal bill not long ago—I am sure everybody remembers that— that would impact one-sixth of our en-tire economy without first—what we need to do again in regular order—get-ting a score from the nonpartisan Con-gressional Budget Office. They are very important. They tell us what cost and what impact it would have on the budget and on the country. So that means we had no idea of the impact of that bill on our markets or what it would cost when voting for it. The minority is routinely shut out of the process, often unable to get so much as a vote on an amendment on the House floor. When Speaker R
YAN assumed the gavel, he promised to re-turn to regular order and an open proc-ess. We have been waiting a mighty long time. Every time we offered an amendment to the bill before us in the Rules Committee, we asked that the rule be open; again, giving all Members a chance to affect that bill. Unani-mously, we are voted against and we lose all those votes 9–4. That means that both sides will not be able to af-fect that bill and it means that regular order is as far away as it ever was. Here we are, less than a month away from the end of the fiscal year, and we haven’t passed a budget resolution through the House. We were supposed to have a budget through the House, the Senate, and the conference—the conference is necessary to reconcile the House and Senate bills—by April 15. We blew through the debt limit in March and still have not dealt with that. We have yet to have a single open rule in the Rules Committee under the Speaker’s leadership. Believe me, I am sure that an awful lot of Members of this House have something to say about what is going on. It is no wonder that, according to the latest figures from Gallup, 79 percent of the public disapproves of how Con-gress is doing its job. No wonder. CBS News highlighted that it costs the taxpayers an estimated $24 million a week to operate the House of Rep-resentatives. They know that they are not getting their money’s worth. They needed 60 votes to repeal and replace healthcare, when there was no replacement in sight. I am not sure how to describe that as a legislative proposal, but what it sounds like to me is a hoax. We are going to fool you that we have really got a replacement here. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, the rule, and the bill. I hope that my good colleague, Mr. WOODALL , and I can help fix this place to do a little better. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I don’t dispute the poll-ing numbers my friend from New York cites. In fact, I am as saddened by those numbers, as she is. But I also feel culpable; not culpable because of the work we are doing today—I think we should be proud—I feel culpable be-cause we all find ourselves in conversa-tions with one another where, instead of building the institution up, we run the institution down. What my friend from New York said about Ms. L
EE’s amendment being changed in the Rules Committee, she is absolutely right, the amendment was changed. But, Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear: it wasn’t changed in some back-room deal with smoke-filled air where no one knows what is happening and can’t read the bill. It was noticed. There was an entire paragraph dedi-cated to saying: Hey, this is unusual. This doesn’t happen that often. We want all the cards on the table so ev-erybody knows. Just understand we made this change this time around. Mr. Speaker, getting the work done in this institution is hard. It leads to conflicting goals. You heard folks from the other side of the aisle say: We are not spending nearly enough time on this bill. We need to make even more amendments in order. And you heard folks on other side of the aisle say: This whole bill is an exercise in futil-ity. I don’t know why we are wasting even one moment on it. It is tough to satisfy both of those concerns simultaneously. We have got this rule book called the United States Constitution. It doesn’t ask a whole lot of the United States Congress. It does ask us to appropriate the money. Under the leadership of both parties, Mr. Speaker, this House has failed to get that done on time year after year. This year, the bipartisan Appropria-tions Committee in subcommittee, in full committee, worked tirelessly, as I said, not for days, not for weeks, but for months. One bill at a time. In fact, one line at a time. That product was brought together by the Rules Committee last month, August 16, Mr. Speaker. That amal-gamation of bills was posted on the internet for all the world to see and read. Every Member of this Congress had a chance to bring their ideas about how to make it better. The Rules Committee got together, looked at those ideas, made more of those ideas in order for debate than we have seen in decades for bills that get completed on time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Will the gen-tleman yield? Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentle-woman from New York. Ms. SLAUGHTER. The Rules Com-mittee did not get together. The major-ity of the Rules Committee got to-gether. We had no action in that game whatsoever. b1345 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I am al-ways compelled to yield to my friend from New York because I am so fond of her and because her leadership has meant so much to this institution. My friend has served on the Rules Committee for even longer than I have, and so my friend understands how the Rules Committee works even better than I do. I don’t want to engage my friend in a colloquy, at least not in my closing statement. We should have this con-versation on day 1. Please, my friend from New York, give us one more word. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, just to speak on accuracy: don’t say the Rules Committee got together and went over those. Say the Rules Com-mittee majority got together and went over those. You know, that is all I ask. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I wel-come my friend’s constructive counsel, but I know for a fact that her calendar looks just like mine does, and that means that we are going in in the early afternoon and we are not getting out till late at night. Why? Because you and I are sitting just three Members apart listening to Member after Member make their case, and in the spirit of accuracy, don’t let it be said that our Members coming and testifying doesn’t make a dif-ference because it does. You and I both believe that. We know it to be true, and it is important that it be true. Those Members come and they tes-tify, they make their case, and then we vote up or down on those amendments.

Mr. Speaker, can we do better? We can. And I will work with absolutely any colleague of any political stripe of any region to do better at any time, but let’s do recognize that we made a commitment to ourselves to get this job done for the first time in a decade. By coming to the floor right now, Mr. Speaker, quarter of 2 on a Thursday afternoon passing this rule, we are going to get this job done together for the first time in a long time. Will we wake up tomorrow and try to do better? You know that we will. Should we take a moment to thank the folks who helped us get here? You know that we should. Mr. Speaker, you are surrounded left and right by Members of the House team. The parliamentarians worked tirelessly to approve the amendments, to make sure they are all written and drafted properly. I want to thank the parliamentarian team for the work that they do. Mr. Speaker, we kick CBO a lot in this place because we don’t like their score one day, we like it the next. CBO has to go through these amendments, score these amendments. I am grateful to them for the work they did to make this possible. Legislative counsel goes through, with each Member of Congress, making sure that every ‘‘i’’ is in the right place, every ‘‘t’’ is crossed. It is not a small task. It is a gargantuan task, and they do it on these big bills day in and day out. I am grateful for that. You are starting to see some of the appropriators come down, Mr. Speaker. Long after my friend from New York and I have left this Chamber, the ap-propriations team is going to be here until the wee hours of the morning once again going through each and every line and each and every amend-ment. I think about what my friend from Louisiana said about the school chil-dren who are turning on C–SPAN and watching this process. I don’t know what they think goes into making this happen, but what I know goes into making this happen is a lot of hard work, staff work, Member work, a lot of big hearts, and a lot of big brains sitting down together hashing through these issues. This rule is worth supporting. The underlying legislation is worth sup-porting, Mr. Speaker, and I ask all of my colleagues to do exactly that. The material previously referred to by Ms. S
LAUGHTER is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 504 O FFERED BY  M
S. SLAUGHTER  At the end of the resolution, add the fol-lowing new sections: S
EC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consider-ation of the bill (H.R. 3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment of status of certain individuals who are long- term United States residents and who en-tered the United States as children and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally di-vided and controlled by the chair and rank-ing minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the con-clusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and re-port the bill to the House with such amend-ments as may have been adopted. The pre-vious question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without in-structions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no reso-lution on the bill, then on the next legisla-tive day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 3440. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT I
TREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), de-scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-mand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is ENTI-TLED to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Repub-lican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Rep-resentatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Al-though it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member con-trolling the time will not yield for the pur-pose of offering an amendment, the same re-sult may be achieved by voting down the pre-vious question on the rule . . . When the mo-tion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the pre-vious question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amend-ment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon re-jection of the motion for the previous ques-tion on a resolution reported from the Com-mittee on Rules, control shifts to the Mem-ber leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for de-bate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican major-ity’s agenda and allows those with alter-native views the opportunity to offer an al-ternative plan. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the res-olution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5-minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of adoption of the resolution.

and configuration reports, pumper and gauger field logs, volume statements, event logs, seal records, and gas anal-ysis. Most of these documents have noth-ing to do with determining the amount of production at a lease and will force businesses to hire more staff just to keep records. This will also likely result in more Federal employees to oversee the bu-reaucracy. This makes zero sense and is simply creating work and overregu-lation for no reason. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I think it is clear that what is at stake is 2.6 billion barrels of oil a day made from wells that make maybe one or two bar-rels, three barrels a day. They are not extremely economic, but those busi-nesses are located in New Mexico. Those businesses keep their head-quarters there. They are just small mom-and-pop operators that care enough about the energy business to stay out there, and so when the govern-ment does things that says we are not going to let you operate, that we are going to shut you down, it accom-plishes what the Saudi Arabians have never been able to accomplish, and that is defeat the spirit that says we can survive any attacks. Mr. Chair, again, I urge people to support this amendment and the under-lying bill, H.R. 3354, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from New Mexico (Mr. P
EARCE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 63 OFFERED BY MR . PEARCE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 63 printed in House Report 115–297. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
At the end of division A (before the short title) insert the following: S
EC. ll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to finalize, imple-ment, or enforce the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management relating to ‘‘Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation’’, pub-lished at 81 Fed. Reg. 83008 (November 18, 2016). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. P
EARCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico for 5 minutes. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the venting and flar-ing rule was, again, put in place by the last administration, intending for BLM to regulate methane. Historically, that had been regulated by the EPA. Now, keep in mind that methane pro-duction from oil wells is down 21 per-cent since 1990, while production is going up. Production is going up, meth-ane production is down. So we wonder why the administration came at the last second to put this rule into place. Basically, the argument is exactly the same for opposing that venting and flaring rule that what is at stake are not the good wells. Those wells are going to produce in their economic with whatever burdens are placed on them. What is at stake are the stripper wells which, again, make up 2.6 billion barrels of production in the U.S. every day, 145 million barrels of production in the State of New Mexico. So you can imagine the economic catastrophe if that 145 million barrels weren’t avail-able to the State to both tax and to provide jobs. Again, 40 percent of New Mexico’s pay, roughly the teachers’ pay, the po-lice pay, roughly that much comes from oil and gas production. You can do the math and see how much New Mexico would be affected if this vent-ing and flaring rule continues to place the burden on the well. The estimates are for each well that a cost of $60,000 is going to be required to come into compliance. Again, keep in mind that this rule comes after the methane is more carefully controlled today under greater production than it ever has been. The estimates are that we will lose thousands of wells if this venting and flaring rule continues. Again, it is the stripper wells which are most at harm. If we lose the 2.6 bil-lion barrels of stripper well production every year because of the high cost of implementation of the venting and flaring rule, that is going to mean we are less energy independent, that we rely more on outside sources. It is going to drive the price of gasoline up. The people who can afford it least are the people at the bottom of the eco-nomic ladder. They will be the ones pe-nalized most by rising prices of gaso-line and decreasing supplies of oil. Mr. Chair, again, I would urge people to support this amendment, the under-lying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 2 min-utes. Ms. M
CCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. M
ICHELLE LUJAN GRIS-
HAM). Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague for yielding me time. Mr. Chair, yesterday the House passed a $7.9 billion downpayment to address the destruction caused by Hur-ricane Harvey, which is projected now to cost as much as $180 billion—by far, today, the costliest hurricane to hit the United States. Today, we are considering an amend-ment which would prohibit BLM from implementing a rule to address the wasteful venting, flaring, and leaking of methane, which is a climate change- causing emission 30 times more power-ful than carbon dioxide. New Mexico is currently home to the largest methane hot spot in the world. Not only is methane a powerful green-house gas, but every cubic foot of gas that is wasted into the atmosphere cheats hardworking New Mexican tax-payers out of precious royalty and tax payments which go toward public edu-cation, infrastructure, and community development programs. Our State desperately needs these in-vestments, and we cannot afford to let money disappear into thin air. BLM, in fact, should work with stakeholders, especially small independent producers who have low-producing wells to make this workable. But taking a sledge-hammer to our Nation’s energy policy is a shortsighted and counter-productive effort. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to collabo-rate to make this rule effective for pro-ducers and taxpayers alike. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. C
ALVERT ), the chairman of the subcommittee. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, the House has spoken several times on the Bureau of Land Management’s methane regula-tion in the past 2 years. I understand the administration is reviewing the regulation and that litigation is ongo-ing. In the meantime, I think action is needed, and so I support this amend-ment and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. G
OSAR ). Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. The BLM venting and flaring rule, or the BLM methane rule, represents one of the Obama administration’s most egre-gious abuses of executive power de-signed to destroy responsible energy production on Federal land. BLM exceeded statutory authority by attempting to regulate air quality; authority that is vested solely with the EPA. Methane emissions from oil and natural gas have significantly declined in recent decades without duplicative Federal regulations in a time when oil and gas production in the U.S. has surged. It is frustrating that this rule is somehow cloaked under the idea that it will benefit taxpayers. It won’t. It is an onerous rule with no connection to the reality of the physics and chemistry of energy production. It will reduce American energy production on Fed-eral land and, therefore, reduce royal-ties due to the U.S. Treasury. This amendment brings account-ability to executive rulemaking. I thank Congressman P
EARCE and ap-plaud him, as well as Congressmen

Westerman and Cramer for their simi-lar amendments crippling other Obama rules. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. P
EARCE ) has expired. Ms. M
CCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, as I said, I rise in opposition to this amendment, as clearly this amendment would pro-hibit BLM from regulating flaring, venting, and leaking of methane from Federal onshore oil and gas operations. In 2016, the BLM finalized its rule which updated regulations that were almost over 30 years old. We have learned a lot about how we have to be more diligent about capturing energy and making America more energy se-cure, because this rule would prevent the waste of an estimated 65 billion cubic feet of natural gas a year and save taxpayers $330 million annually. BLM has a responsibility to the tax-payers, and that means capturing what is flared off, what is burnt off, which is potential energy. We have developed technologies in the past 30 years to capture this and make it work even more effectively for the taxpayers when we lease out these leases and roy-alties. Just for a fact, I share that the Bakken oil field, when it was at its height, flared more—I am from the Twin Cities—flared more and brighter than the metropolitan area in St. Paul and Minneapolis. That is how bright the flare was that the satellites cap-tured at night. That was burning en-ergy, energy consumption that should have been captured because we owe it to future generations to get it right when it comes to our energy produc-tion. Mr. Chairman, the amendment is bad for public health, it shortchanges the American taxpayers, and I urge my col-leagues to oppose it. I don’t think we are going to change each other’s minds on this because the bottom line is, and I have been consistent with this, this belongs in the Policy Committee. This only would change something for a year. You would have to come back year after year after year. If there is something where we can find common ground on, we can find it in the Policy Committee. We can’t find it on an Ap-propriations Committee where it ex-pires every year. I ride the elevator with the gen-tleman, Mr. Chair, and I am sure he is going to enlighten me some more. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. b2300 The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from New Mexico (Mr. P

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 65 printed in House Report 115–297. Mr. M
CEACHIN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
At the end of division A (before the short title), insert the following: 
LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR DEVELOPING  
A NEW 5 -YEAR -OFFSHORE -PLAN  S
EC. ll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to prepare a five- year offshore oil and gas leasing program that would schedule any Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lease sale before 2022. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. M
CEACHIN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. M
CEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It would prevent the Depart-ment of the Interior from preparing a new 5-year offshore oil and gas leasing program that schedules leases before the year 2022. Mr. Chairman, offshore drilling car-ries real consequences, from the indus-trialization of our coasts to the ines-capable risk of another BP Deepwater Horizon-like disaster. Those risks can not be eliminated. As Deepwater Horizon made clear, accidents can inflict damage of an al-most unimaginable scale. BP has spent billions of dollars responding to that disaster. That figure reflects liabilities that arose from massive and irreparable damage to our environment, perma-nent harm to economically essential industries, and countless other impacts on the Gulf Coast residents’ quality of life. We have to make sure that other regions are never exposed to those kind of harms. That is why my amendment is important. In the event of a drilling accident, thriving coastal economies could be decimated. Industries that rely upon a healthy marine environment—every-thing from the tourist trade to our fisheries—could disappear overnight. If a spill were big enough—and we have seen that they can be enormous— the economic consequences would rip-ple throughout the national economy, hurting millions of Americans who live many miles from the sea. Again, we cannot afford such economic risks. It is equally foolish to risk the nat-ural beauty, fragile habitats, and irre-placeable species for the benefit of a few massive oil and gas companies. Our coasts are home to some of our most iconic and unique wildlife. Healthy oceans are critical to tradi-tional ways of life, having provided subsistence resources for many genera-tions. Those places, those species, those customs are part of why we live in the greatest country on Earth. No other place could match the richness and di-versity of the United States of Amer-ica. We must not endanger the incred-ible heritage in a quest for dirty en-ergy, especially the kind of fuels that can drive catastrophic changes to our climate, with grave and permanent consequences for our society. It is important to note that prohib-iting the preparation of a new leasing program does not stop any of the cur-rently scheduled lease sales until 2022 from happening. My amendment just puts us back on the regular schedule for writing the next plan. Prohibiting the preparation of a new leasing program, however, does ensure that millions of taxpayer dollars are not spent reworking a plan that was just completed this year. Restarting a new 5-year leasing proc-ess would throw away 21⁄2years and tens of millions of dollars of effort, ig-nore overwhelming bipartisan opposi-tion from millions of people up and down our coasts, and eliminate the pro-tections that President Obama pro-vided for the fragile Arctic. Mr. Chairman, the risk of a new 5- year offshore oil and gas leasing pro-gram are simply too high and the con-sequences are too severe. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I certainly sympathize with many of the comments that the spon-sor of this amendment has brought up. Certainly, none of us have any inten-tion of trashing the environment, of causing environmental degradation in any of our coastal areas in the United States. But the thing is that this amendment doesn’t cut production. It would not re-sult in any reduction in oil and gas ex-ploration and production activities. And if it were to do that, then all that would happen is it would increase our dependence upon foreign imports of oil. The reality and statistics are very clear. You are less safe transporting energy than you are producing it. The statistics are very clear. Putting it into a ship is less safe. Putting it into a pipeline is less safe than actually producing it. So you are not doing any-thing to benefit the environment. The next thing is that, within ap-proximately 1 month of the Obama ad-ministration’s being sworn into office in 2009—as I recall, I believe it was on February 10—Secretary Salazar stood

up and said: We are rewriting the 5- year offshore leasing plan of the pre-vious administration. They walked right in and said: We are throwing this out. Which the amendment’s sponsor said was billions of dollars in implications and much planning. It is exactly what the Obama admin-istration did. So if the Trump adminis-tration chooses to take a fresh look at these resources and these resources, then I want to quote the Obama admin-istration saying that these are offshore energy resources that belong to all Americans. Mr. Chairman, I want to make one other note. If you read the amendment, it says that none of the funds made available in this act may be used to re-pair a 5-year offshore oil and gas leas-ing program that would schedule any Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lease sale before 2022. This wouldn’t just prohibit making changes to it, such as, perhaps, the idea of expanding it if public comments and other input found that that was the best thing to do, but it also would prevent slowing down the lease sale schedule. Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to this amendment. While I certainly sup-port the gentleman’s intent to prevent any type of environmental harm and degradation, I just want to say in clos-ing that I was the lead trustee for the State of Louisiana in the Deepwater Horizon spill. When you look at Outer Continental Shelf energy production, we had pro-duced trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. We had produced billions of barrels of oil. What the courts found in the BP incident was that there was gross neg-ligence and willful misconduct. They didn’t find that there were problems with the rules and other things. That is why, as the gentleman correctly started, that they had to spend tens of billions of dollars paying for their gross negligence and willful misconduct, which is very different than the trillions of cubic feet of nat-ural gas, and billions of barrels of oil that we have produced safely; we pro-duced them in the United States; and we have not put them in pipelines and tankers in other less safe mechanisms of transportation. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, what is the balance of my time? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 1
1⁄2minutes remain-ing. Mr. M
CEACHIN. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. C
AL-
VERT ), the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, this amendment would prevent the Depart-ment of the Interior from performing a necessary and thorough review of the existing 5-year plan. Meanwhile, the committee encouraged a review of the 5-year plan in the 2017 omnibus, which we just enacted just a few months ago. For these reasons and others, I cer-tainly urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amend-ment. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I just want to say that, once again, while I under-stand the gentleman’s intent to pre-vent any type of environmental deg-radation—I think everyone shares that objective—the reality is that this amendment doesn’t do anything to ad-vance that objective. And potentially, should there be some type of emergent situation where you would want to slow down lease sales, this amendment would actually prohibit that from hap-pening. We should take a fresh look with public input and with the best science to determine where we produce, how we produce, to maximize domestic energy production, to maximize or to reduce dependence upon foreign energy, to maximize economic opportunities and employment opportunities in the United States. Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, just briefly, of course, I was not here at the time, but it was my understanding that this is nothing unlike what the other side of the aisle did during the Obama administration. So what this amend-ment seeks to do, in many cases, is not that unusual. And while the gentleman is correct, the size of the payments that BP had to make were because of a certain type of conduct: What we want to do is just freeze things where they are. While I acknowledge that there is a possibility that somehow someone wanted to slow down the process, I don’t believe that this administration would do just that. Again, millions of dollars have been spent. Much time has been spent in de-veloping this plan. I think we just need to leave it in place. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Virginia (Mr. M
CEACHIN ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 66 OFFERED BY MR . GROTHMAN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 66 printed in House Report 115–297. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
At the end of division A (before the short title), insert the following: S
EC. ll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement, ad-minister, or enforce the rule entitled ‘‘Na-tional Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone’’ published by the Environmental Pro-tection Agency in the Federal Register on October 26, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 65292). The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. G
ROTHMAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 3354. The purpose of my amendment is to prohibit use of funds made available by this act to implement, administer, and enforce the EPA’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone rule, which was originally published on Oc-tober 26, 2015. This rule will make the standards more stringent in other places, in the State of Wisconsin, up and down Lake Michigan, including counties such as Sheboygan County. As you make these standards more stringent—first of all, it makes no sense because they don’t take in the fact that there are areas like mine in which the ozone is coming from outside my district. For example, Sheboygan County, whatever they do, I don’t think they could ever meet those standards be-cause there is so much ozone coming up from the Chicago area. But there is an effect to these standards as well. The standards make it more difficult for industry along Lake Michigan to operate, to comply with the standards, putting us at a competitive disadvan-tage not only with other parts around the country, but a competitive dis-advantage compared to other areas around the world with much more pol-lution than we have. Right now our ozone is much less than it was when I was a child. Quite frankly, when I was a child, nobody complained anyway. Another thing about these ozone standards, it is something that people who are looking out for that not par-ticularly wealthy people should pay at-tention to. When you aren’t meeting the standards, it creates a situation in which your owners of automobiles have to have their cars tested every year. And sometimes these cars have to go through very expensive repairs to meet the standards. Now, there are people who are going to think that is no big deal because they are maybe wealthy Congressmen and they need to buy a car every 3 or 4 years and they don’t have a problem. But if you are somebody who has a 10- or 15-year-old car, maybe you can only afford to spend $500, $1,000 on a car, and then once a year you have to get the car tested. You flunk the test and you have to put $1,000 or $1,500 into it. No wonder we have some people in this country who can’t get ahead as long as the environmental extremists are run-ning the EPA. So, in any event, I think it would be good if we don’t spend any more money implementing this new rule. Give the EPA more time to reconsider this rule and come up with something a little bit more reasonable.

Mr. Chairman, I encourage my col-leagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 min-utes. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, while I understand the gentleman’s intent, I share his concern with the 2015 ozone standards, the bill’s language in the amendment goes a little too far. It ties this new administration’s hands with respect to reconsideration or flexibility efforts that they are trying to build in at the present time. Meanwhile, the ozone language in the underlying bill provides the necessary administrative relief for communities to comply with the overlapping 2008 and 2015 requirements. I think that this administration understands the com-plexities that are being imposed by this 2015 requirement. They are trying to deal with it. Mr. Pruitt has indicated that publicly. Mr. Chairman, I would urge my col-leagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. G

AMENDMENT NO . 67 OFFERED BY MR . LAMBORN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 67 printed in House Report 115–297. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
At the end of division A (before the short title), insert the following: 
LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS  S
EC. ll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement or en-force the threatened species or endangered species listing of any plant or wildlife that has not undergone a review as required by section 4(c)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(2)). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. L
AMBORN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It simply ensures that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is following current law, specifically sec-tion 4(c)(2) of the Endangered Species Act, by conducting a review of all threatened and endangered plants and wildlife at least once every 5 years. Time after time, the Federal Govern-ment refuses to follow the original in-tent of the Endangered Species Act. The government designates land as critical habitat despite not meeting the ESA definition, and the govern-ment consistently refuses to remove plants and animals from threatened or endangered status even when these spe-cies are flourishing and are no longer in need of ESA protections. But you may ask yourself: How does the government know when the species should be removed from the endangered or threatened list? How does the gov-ernment know if a species is recov-ering? The answer can be found in the ESA and its requirement that the Fed-eral Government review all plants or species that are currently listed as en-dangered or threatened every 5 years. Under the act, the purpose of a 5-year review is to ensure that threatened or endangered species have the appro-priate level of protection. The reviews assess each threatened and endangered species to determine whether its status has changed since the time of its list-ing or its last status review and wheth-er its status should be changed or maintained. Because the act grants extensive pro-tection to a species, including harsh penalties for landowners and other citi-zens, it makes sense to regularly verify if a plant or animal is being properly classified or should be delisted. Despite this commonsense requirement, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has ac-knowledged that it has neglected its responsibility to conduct the required reviews for hundreds of listed species. By enforcing the 5-year review— which is in the law—my amendment will ensure that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is using the best avail-able and most current scientific infor-mation in implementing its respon-sibilities under that act, including in-corporating new information through public comment and assessing ongoing conservation efforts. Now, I am sure you will hear the ranking member say that the problem is that there is simply not enough money to comply with the law, but the reality is that megasettlements and overzealous regulators have caused the number of species listed under the en-dangered species list to balloon to un-manageable levels. For the recovery of a threatened or endangered species or plant to be successful, we must prioritize our limited resources to where they are most critically needed. I encourage my colleagues to join me in ensuring that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service complies with the ESA and that we do not provide money in this bill that would violate current law. This exact amendment was added to the fiscal year ’16 Interior Appro-priations bill by voice vote and was added to the fiscal year ’17 bill by a bi-partisan rollcall vote. Mr. Chairman, I ask Members to sup-port this amendment for the third time, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 min-utes. Ms. M
CCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Colorado is right. We have had this conversation in this Chamber, Mr. Chair, before. The Serv-ice does attempt to comply with the statutory mandate and to review the status of listed species every 5 years to determine whether or not it is classi-fied as threatened or endangered. It is correct. The Service has a back-log in reviews due to funding limita-tions. This year it is a 17 percent list-ing reduction contained in this bill so that they have been working on the backlog. But the Service still has only been able to complete 100 to 120 reviews per year, which is half of what is need-ed. So in this bill, you and I might agree that there are things that could happen and that money isn’t always the solu-tion to a problem, but in this bill you might be surprised to know that it has cut another $3.4 million, so that only builds up the backlog all the more. That is not necessarily the fault of the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Chair. It is just the fact that the allo-cation that our subcommittee had to work with, tough choices had to be made. I know that the chairman was trying to balance a lot of things. The gentleman talked about the court and the environment. I would love to have a conversation with the gentleman more about that, because it is my understanding—and I want to make sure I have it correct before we go into depth about it because, as the gentleman knows, we have a good rela-tionship, and I want to make sure that I am correct when I say things—that actually some of the things that have been happening in court have actually helped to reduce some of the costs that the gentleman is thinking about be-cause it is in place. I will get the information, Mr. Chair, and share it with the gentleman later. But the fact is that this amendment would not remove species without re-view from the list of species protected by the ESA so that the ESA’s prohibi-tion, again, would still remain, and it still would be the ability of citizens to sue or force compliance even with what the gentleman is proposing. So funding cannot be used to enforce the ESA for species with late reviews; it is going to leave the species unprotected. Proposed language would prohibit the Service from working with the agencies. It would prohibit working with developers and landowners to comply, compliance to section 7 con-sultations or section 10 permits for Federal and private projects that could potentially affect the species. So as you can see, the other thing it doesn’t do is the proposed language would not affect the ability of third parties to sue those agencies or landowners.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7179 September 7, 2017 
So I agree with the gentleman that we need to do a better job of making sure that these reviews are done in a timely fashion. I agree that, when a species has attained a classification where it is no longer threatened or it is no longer endangered, it should come off. So I think we have a lot in com-mon. But I think that the challenge with this amendment is that, without the funding, in order for the Service to do the job that it has to do, it just kind of puts the Service in a box in which we are saying you are not doing a good job and, therefore, we are going to start changing the way in which we proceed. So I, right now, have to oppose this amendment. But as I said, in the policy committee I think that there is room for some of us to come together and to make improvement, but legislating this rider for 1 year at a time on this appropriations bill doesn’t allow us to have the deep, transparent, and open discussion that we need to have to re-solve your issue. So at this time I oppose the amend-ment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. C
ALVERT ). Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I ap-preciate the gentlewoman’s comments. If we get additional resources in the future, I would love to make sure that Fish and Wildlife has the resources to make sure they meet their mandates, and they should meet them now. One of the mandates they have is re-view the status of every listed species every 5 years and a corresponding change in the status if it is called for by those reviews. Instead of doing those reviews, in many cases, the Serv-ice chooses to spend the money to list more species. If the government isn’t willing to shoulder the responsibilities that come with listing species under the ESA, perhaps it shouldn’t be listing those species in the first place. So I think they need to meet their obligations under the law. I certainly support this amendment, and I encourage Members to support the amendment and vote for it. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for that state-ment. I will say to the gentlewoman from Minnesota that I would love to work with her on this. I know that, in the Natural Resources Committee, we are going to be looking at some of the dif-ferent facets of the Endangered Species Act, and I hope we can continue this dialogue. This amendment seeks to make the agency comply with the law. That pro-vision is in there for a reason, so let’s enforce what Congress, in its wisdom, put into the law many years ago. Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). The amendment was agreed to.

LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS  S

Mr. Chairman, the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse is a tiny rodent with a body approximately 3 inches long, a 4- to 6-inch-long tail, and large hind feet adapted for jumping. This largely noc-turnal mouse lives primarily in streamside ecosystems along the foot-hills of southeastern Wyoming south to Colorado Springs, in my district, along the eastern ridge of the Front Range of Colorado. To evade predators, the mouse can jump, like a miniature kangaroo, up to 18 inches high. In 1998, it leaped onto the Endangered Species list, a move that has hindered development from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Wyo-ming. Among projects that have been af-fected: the Jeffco Parkway southeast of Rocky Flats, an expansion of Chatfield Reservoir, and housing developments in El Paso County along tributaries of Monument Creek. Builders, land-owners, and local governments in af-fected areas have incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in added costs be-cause of this mouse. Protecting the Preble’s mouse has even been placed ahead of protecting human life and property. On September 11, 2013, Colorado expe-rienced a major flood event that dam-aged or destroyed thousands of homes, important infrastructure, and public works projects. As a result of the Preble’s mouse being listed as an en-dangered species, many restoration projects were delayed as Colorado sought a waiver. In fact, FEMA was so concerned that they sent out a notice that stated: ‘‘Legally required review may cause some delay in projects un-dertaken in the Preble’s mouse habi-tat.’’ It went on to warn that ‘‘local of-ficials who proceed with projects with-out adhering to environmental laws risk fine and could lose Federal fund-ing for their projects.’’ While a waiver was essentially grant-ed, the scientific evidence simply does not justify these delays or the millions of dollars in taxpayer money that go toward protecting a mouse that is ac-tually part of a larger group that roams throughout half of the North American continent. Scientific studies have concluded that the Preble’s mouse does not war-rant protection because it isn’t a sub-species at all and is actually related to the Bear Lodge jumping mouse. Even the scientist that originally classified this mouse as a subspecies has since re-canted his work and agrees that the Preble’s mouse subspecies designation is no longer defensible. Moreover, the Preble’s mouse has a low conservation parity score. What that means is that hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent on protection efforts that could have and should have been spent on other more sensitive species. My amendment would correct this in-justice that has been caused by the in-accurate listing of the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse. It would refocus U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s efforts on species that have been thoroughly sci-entifically vetted and that should be managed by the Endangered Species Act. This exact amendment was added to the fiscal year ’16 Interior Appropria-tions bill by voice vote and was added to the fiscal year ’17 bill by a bipar-tisan rollcall vote. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment for a third time. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. M
CCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 min-utes. b2330 Ms. M
CCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, clearly, what this amendment does— and it is different from the other amendment—is prohibit the Fish and Wildlife Service from implementing or enforcing the threatened species listing of the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse under the Endangered Species Act. It full-out restricts the Service from of-fering any critical protections to pre-serve the species. Once a species like this is listed under the Endangered Species Act, the role of the Fish and Wildlife Service is fairly permissive. They can help par-ties comply with the act as they carry out their other activities. The Service right now is reviewing and considering all the comments that they received during the public com-ment period, and a draft recovery plan is being worked through to develop a final recovery plan. But with this

amendment, the Service would not be able to continue to recover the species. All the Endangered Species Act prohi-bitions would still apply. So, in other words, we would stop them from moving forward, but they would still be under jurisdiction to comply. They wouldn’t be able to com-ply by working with agencies and land developers and landowners to provide the ESA compliance. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would be barred from issuing permits or from offering exemptions. That means landowners, industry, and other parties who might need to take the Preble’s meadow jumping mouse inci-dental to otherwise lawful activities, such as urban development, are vulner-able to third-party lawsuits. Another limitation that the Service would have would be undertaking the required status reviews of subspecies or initiating any rulemaking or downlisting or delisting species. So now we are talking about deep dives into what the U.S. Fish and Wild-life may or may not be impacted by doing or helping landowners or devel-opers on an appropriations bill. Quite frankly, as I have been saying all night—and I understand people have the right to come here with these amendments—the Service has a respon-sibility to implement the Endangered Species Act. They are charged with ful-filling their legal requirements. When they don’t fulfill their legal require-ments, it makes them more vulnerable to lawsuits, which I know is not the goal of the author of this amendment, Mr. Chair. But when there are lawsuits incurred, it creates more costs for American taxpayers. The gentleman’s amendment would just undermine the Service’s ability to work collaboratively with States and local communities. It opens the Serv-ice up for lawsuits and it would create even more uncertainty for landowners and make them vulnerable, as I said, to lawsuits. I think we should be working to sup-port the Fish and Wildlife efforts, not blocking the agency from doing its job and going back to what we discussed earlier, that is working through the committees of authorization, and then the authorizing committees having conversations with the Appropriations Committee on how they can achieve their goals, this being one of them. Because of those reasons, I do not support this amendment. I thank the gentleman for bringing this forward, but at this time I cannot support it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. C
ALVERT ) to weigh in on this issue. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to jump up and support this amendment. Obviously, the agency has not leaped fast enough and problems persist. So I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment, and I know it will squeak by with a large margin. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I will conclude by saying there is one other sort of a temporary element in this whole episode. And that is when you go from Colorado into Wyoming, the mouse is no longer threatened or en-dangered. There is a political boundary line between the two States. In its wisdom, the Fish and Wildlife Service says that if you go north far enough across the State line, it is no longer threatened or endangered. There is an element of arbitrariness that I think also calls into question why this was ever done in the first place. Mr. Chairman, I would ask support for this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. L

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal God, the Lord of the Harvest, we acknowledge that only by Your might can we live productive lives. Inspire our lawmakers in their daily work to labor for Your glory. Give them the desire to please You even with their motives so that their thoughts, words, and deeds will honor You. Keep them from avoiding irksome and unpleasant issues, as they arrange their priorities to accomplish Your purposes. Lord, guide them in the paths of jus-tice and cooperation as understanding and forbearance prevail among them. We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Presiding Officer led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f

ENSASSE, a Senator from the State of Nebraska, to perform the duties of the Chair. ORRIN G. H ATCH , President pro tempore. 
Mr. SASSE thereupon assumed the Chair as Acting President pro tempore. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
TRANGE ). The majority leader is rec-ognized. 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR—S.J. RES. 49 Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there is a joint resolution at the desk that is due a second read-ing. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the joint resolution by title for the second time. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: 
A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 49) con-demning the violence and domestic terrorist attack that took place during events be-tween August 11 and August 12, 2017, in Char-lottesville, Virginia, recognizing the first re-sponders who lost their lives while moni-toring the events, offering deepest condo-lences to the families and friends of those in-dividuals who were killed and deepest sym-pathies and support to those individuals who were injured by the violence, expressing sup-port for the Charlottesville community, re-jecting White nationalists, White suprema-cists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups, and urging the President and the President’s Cabinet to use all available resources to address the threats posed by those groups. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. In order to place the joint resolution on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I ob-ject to further proceedings. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion having been heard, the joint reso-lution will be placed on the calendar. HURRICANE HARVEY DISASTER RELIEF, FUNDING THE GOVERN-MENT, AND PREVENTING A DE-FAULT Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-dent, at the outset of the week, I out-lined three issues we needed to address immediately: provide resources for Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma preparedness, ensure that the govern-ment remains funded, and ensure that a default is prevented so the emergency resources I mentioned can actually get to Americans who need them. That is what the legislation I filed cloture on yesterday achieves, and it achieves it all together in one package. It will provide certainty and stability for first responders, State officials, and the many others involved in preparing for and recovering from these storms with critically needed emergency re-sources that will not be interrupted by the prospect of a shutdown or default. The recovery effort for a record-set-ting storm like Harvey has strained re-sources to the limit already. The ad-vance of another historic storm now makes the need for action even more urgent, so let’s work together and act on this legislation very quickly. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following leader remarks, the Senate be in a pe-riod of morning business, with Sen-ators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, until 11 a.m. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT JOSEPH LEON GEORGE SHOULD BE HONORED FOR HEROISM AT PEARL HAR-BOR, HAWAII, ON DECEMBER 7, 1941 Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, last month I spoke here about an amazing story I was told when I had the oppor-tunity to host several veterans who survived the sinking of the USS Ari-zona during the attack on Pearl Har-bor. They recalled to me the incredible story of a true American hero named Joe George, and I would like to briefly remind everyone of that story now. On December 7, 1941, Joe was a 26- year-old boatswain’s mate second class aboard the repair ship USS Vestal in Pearl Harbor, HI. That morning, the Vestal was moored alongside the USS Arizona. At 7:48 a.m., many sailors, including Joe, had just finished their breakfast when the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service attacked Pearl Harbor. As we know, the Arizona suffered a direct hit by a Japanese bomb that det-onated in the ship’s powder magazine. The resulting explosion sank the ship and claimed the lives of 1,177 service-men. During this unimaginable chaos and carnage, Joe George displayed stunning composure and courage. Joe spotted six sailors trapped in the control tower of the sinking USS Arizona. These men were severely burned and were search-ing for a way to safety. Those six wounded sailors were Sea-man First Class Harold Kuhn, Seaman First Class Russell Lott, Gunner’s Mate Third Class Earl Riner, Boat-swain’s Mate Second Class Alvin Dvork, Seaman First Class Donald Stratton, and Fire Controlman Third Class Lauren Bruner. Upon seeing these men, Joe threw a heaving line between the Vestal and the Arizona to rescue the wounded soldiers from the sinking ship. Suspended 40 feet in the air, the six sailors climbed 70 feet hand-over-hand across the rope to safety on board the Vestal. These sailors did all this while enduring inju-ries so severe that two would succumb to their wounds in the weeks following the attack. As they struggled across the heavy line, Joe George remained close by, all the while encouraging the men to push on. The four soldiers who survived their injuries each returned to serve with honor during World War II, and then went on to live long lives. Joe George’s legacy of heroism will remain alive for-ever in the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the four sailors who survived that infamous day thanks to Joe George’s incredible bravery and service. Joe George was never awarded a medal for his role in the rescue of these six sailors, although his commanding officer commended his courageous ac-tions. When I met one of the Arizona sur-vivors who was rescued by Joe, he told me: 
Joe George was never awarded anything for his bravery. He is no longer with us, but I believe in his memory he should be awarded the Navy Cross. 
Lauren Bruner was another survivor Joe saved. He said to me: 
The six of us would not have survived ex-cept for his courage, in spite of being at high risk himself. He fully deserves high com-mendations for his actions. I feel he should be recognized for this courage and presented the Navy Cross. 
In his own words during an interview in 1978, Joe said: 
I’ll tell you, the only thing I could tell you about that day. . . . My conscience was my guide. 
Well, his conscience was that of a hero. We need more people like Joe George in this world. That is why today I am committed to honoring Joe and why I rise today with the honor and privilege to call for unanimous consent in the adoption of a resolution honoring Joseph Leon George. Joe passed away in 1996, and it is long overdue that the Senate, the U.S. Navy, and a grateful nation honor the heroism of Boatswain’s Mate Second Class Joseph Leon George. God bless Joe George, whose im-mense courage and astounding composure serves as an example for the men and women in uniform who follow in his wake. Let us never forget their heroism and sacrifice. I would like to thank my colleagues Senators G
ARDNER , L EE, C OTTON , M
CCASKILL , and B ENNET for joining me in this resolution and for helping to en-sure its adoption here today. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the Armed Services Com-mittee be discharged from further con-sideration of and the Senate now pro-ceed to the consideration of S. Res. 243. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 243) expressing the sense of the Senate that Joseph Leon George should be honored for heroism at Pearl Har-bor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. 
There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 243) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in the R
ECORD of August 2, 2017, under ‘‘Submitted Resolutions.’’) Mr. FLAKE. Thank you, Mr. Presi-dent. I yield back, and I suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

HURRICANE IRMA Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am here to give a report on behalf of Flor-ida to the Senate. Senator R
UBIO and I were there all day yesterday in Miami and in other parts of South Florida, and we are preparing for what will be another Andrew. Andrew was thought to be a category 4, but it actually was a category 5, with winds in excess of 155 miles per hour. Likewise, that is what we have now. I see the leader has come in. I will speak for just a few minutes, then, giving an update. There are a number of things. I be-lieve the Federal Government is pre-pared, unlike we were 25 years ago with Hurricane Andrew. The Federal Government is certainly prepositioning supplies, but look at the situation with regard to FEMA. FEMA is stretched, and of all things, FEMA runs out of money unless we act by to-morrow. Thus, I left Florida in the middle of the night to come back to make sure that it has my stamp of imprimatur on this legislation. I am very glad that the majority leader has agreed to double the

amount, basically $7.5 billion for FEMA and another $7.5 billion for CDBG’s, or community development block grants, both of which would be for natural disasters. Because of that, it gives the flexibility to FEMA that some of the money will be used in case Irma hits Florida. But there is also the fact that Irma has already devastated our fellow U.S. citizens in the Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. So as to this package, it is essential that we pass this legislation and pass it quick-ly, and especially pass it before tomor-row. There are some needs that need to be called to the attention of FEMA. I have emailed yesterday to the Adminis-trator of FEMA Brock Long. People are trying to get out, but they are stuck on the roads, and now they are running out of gasoline. Looking at the pictures on anything going north out of Florida, the roads are jammed. The interstates and the turnpike are jammed. The phenomenon that is occurring is that people need gasoline and they are running out on the road, which adds all the more to the chaos. They are going to the gaso-line stations and the gas stations are running out of gasoline. So I made an urgent plea yesterday, and I would make that to FEMA again, that we get gasoline into the State of Florida and down into the peninsula, so as the evacuation orders come along the coast, as the hurricane gets closer and closer, people will be able to flee. This is an unusual one. Usually, we will see the tracks from the National Hurricane Center move around. Basi-cally, the track of what is expected from the National Hurricane Center has stayed fairly steady for last 36 hours. We will get our next update at 11 this morning, but it will hit South Florida somewhere in the Miami area, and it will go right up the coast. It will go on up the coast of Georgia, South Caro-lina, and into North Carolina. That is a massive population along the eastern seaboard of the United States. Finally, I would state that, as we consider this package, which I think we will pass, I want the Senate to be forewarned that this $15 billion pack-age is only temporary. It will probably only take us through mid-October, at the most. With the massive number of requirements in Texas, and add to that at least that much, if not more, for the eastern seaboard, particularly with not only water damage but wind damage that is being done and the destruction of the residences and people being homeless, what we have seen in Texas, unfortunately, with the terrible things that have happened there, that could almost be so overwhelmed by what could happen in Florida. I urge the Senate—I implore the Sen-ate, and I beg the Senate—to pass this package while recognizing that there is going to have to be a lot more to come. Finally, congratulations to the mi-nority leader, the Democratic leader. I think of him as the majority leader. My congratulations to him. He is a consummate dealmaker, and I say that in the best sense of the word because, absolutely, that is what the American people want us to do. They want us to get together in a bipartisan way to get things done—to build bipartisan con-sensus to get results. Senator S
CHU-
MER, the Democratic leader, has done that, and he has done it with flying colors. I yield the floor.

THANKING THE SENATOR FROM FLORIDA Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, let me thank my friend from Florida for his kind words. During these troubled times in the State of Florida—and we hope and pray that Irma will not do too much dam-age, although signs point in the other direction—the people of Florida could not have a stronger, more effective, more compassionate advocate than the Senator from Florida, Mr. N
ELSON . He knows how to get things done, and he knows how to inform people about what is going on. He is able to reach across the aisle, in a bipartisan way, to help in all times but, particularly, in times of need. The people of Florida are lucky to have him as their Senator, particularly at this moment, I would say to my dear friend B
ILLNELSON .

HURRICANE HARVEY DISASTER RELIEF, THE DEBT CEILING, AND FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-terday, the congressional leadership and the President reached a bipartisan deal on three crucial issues: short-term aid for the victims of Hurricane Har-vey, the debt ceiling, and government funding. Alongside the aid package for Texas and Louisiana, the Senate will take up and pass an extension of government funding and the debt ceiling, both to December 15, although that may be modified to December 8, as I under-stand it. We all agreed to work to-gether to avoid a default in December as well. This is a good agreement for the American people, and everyone should breathe a huge sigh of relief. This agreement takes the threat of a shut-down and default off the table this month and will help us quickly get re-sources to FEMA and other agencies that are helping with rescue and recov-ery in the wake of Harvey and that will, in all likelihood, be needed in the wake of Irma as well. The Nation has been clamoring for bipartisanship—for the two parties to work together to do the country’s busi-ness—rather than to engage in needless brinksmanship. Yesterday’s agreement was a ray of hope for both parties com-ing together on the big issues. Also, let it be a ray of hope that both parties can come together to help the Dream-ers. We Democrats have said from the very beginning of this Congress that we are willing to work with our Repub-lican colleagues and the President for the good of the country so long as we do not sacrifice our principles. We have never been for obstruction for obstruc-tion’s sake, and we will never be for that. This agreement is a reminder that we do not always have to wait until the eleventh hour—risking shut-down, risking default—in order to com-promise and do the right thing. Impor-tantly, this agreement gives Congress a way forward on what are some of the thorniest issues this month, allowing us to move to other vital work. The 3-month agreement is a com-promise. In the past, so many of our colleagues have said: ‘‘If the other party is President, we are not going to do anything to help.’’ We did not want to say that. We did not want to say: ‘‘It is all on you.’’ We wanted to com-promise. A compromise is just that— not dictating what should happen but working together. I give the President credit for understanding that in the Oval Office when Leader PELOSI and I made the compromise suggestion. I thank him for it.

DREAM ACT AND OTHER WORK BEFORE THE SENATE Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, since President Trump’s decision to end DACA on Tuesday, it is absolutely nec-essary that Congress move forward to pass a clean Dream Act while 800,000 Dreamers anxiously await action by this Congress. There is no reason to wait. Let’s put a clean Dream Act on the floor, which I believe would pass by a significant margin, and tell these hard-working Dreamers that they be-long in this country, too—the country they want to be part of desperately. If the majority leader and Speaker do not offer a clean Dream Act, we Democrats will find other legislative vehicles to attach it to until it passes. Let me say this. I spoke once again to the President this morning. He called and said that he wanted to help with the Dream Act. There are many ways to help, and here are two. One is to persuade other Republican Senators to cosponsor the bill that has been in-troduced by Senators D
URBIN and G RA-
HAM. We now have four Republican co-sponsors, and we need more. There are many in the Senate who seem to be sympathetic to the Dream Act. Maybe the President can help them get to co-sponsor. The second is to urge my friend, the Republican leader from Kentucky, and the Speaker of the House, Mr. R
YAN, to put the Dream Act on the floor ASAP. We can get this

done and get it done quickly. We can end the anguish of so many Americans and make sure that our economy con-tinues to move forward so that it is not needlessly ripped apart. There is other work that we have to do in healthcare to shore up the mar-ketplaces, particularly by guaran-teeing the cost reduction programs. Discussions in the HELP Committee between my good friend, Chairman A
LEXANDER , and our great ranking member, P
ATTY MURRAY , are pro-ceeding in a bipartisan way in, perhaps, the new spirit of the moment—maybe longer than a moment, we hope and pray. I am hopeful that the full Senate, this month, will be able to take up and consider bipartisan legislation that emerges from the committee in order to stabilize and improve our healthcare system. In a similar vein, we must consider a multiyear reauthorization of CHIP, the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Chairman H
ATCH and Ranking Member W
YDEN —again, in a bipartisan action— are having a hearing on CHIP today in the Finance Committee, and that should be another matter of immediate priority for this Senate. Of course, as the people of Florida brace for Hurricane Irma, and the peo-ple of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have gone through it now, the Senate must be prepared to quickly re-spond to that storm just as we are doing with Harvey. We also have to take into account some of the other disasters that are occurring in States like Washington, Oregon, California, and Montana. Wildfires are raging out of control. They, too, will need disaster assistance. Because of the immediate and strong impact of Harvey and, it seems, Irma, we should not forget that our friends in the West will need dis-aster relief and will need it soon as well. The deal we reached with Republican leaders and President Trump yesterday will allow Congress to work on all of these important items this month and in the following months without there being a looming specter of a shutdown or default on our debt. It should help to bring both sides together to, ulti-mately, get another deal on sequester relief, lower healthcare premiums, the Dreamers, and many other items in De-cember. That is good for this Congress, and that is good for the American peo-ple—a ray of hope, as I said. The majority leader has already filed cloture on this package. I hope that we can proceed quickly—hopefully, today—to ensure its passage. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maryland.

DACA Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to share with my colleagues a meeting that I had last Thursday in Montgomery County, MD, with CASA de Maryland. We put together a round-table discussion to talk about immi-gration and the need for immigration reform and the concerns we had about the current status of people who are concerned about what is happening with immigration enforcement. That was before the President had made his announcement on terminating the DACA Program, which is the program that provides relief for the Dreamers— those who have been in this country for a long period of time and know only America as their home. I must tell you that, at that discus-sion I had last Thursday in Mont-gomery County, MD, the fear of uncer-tainty was clear to me. I talked to many families who were concerned about how the Trump administration was enforcing our current laws, what would be the resolution of the tem-porary protective status, TPS, under which people are here legally, and I had a chance to see firsthand some of the Dreamers who are here under the pro-tection of the DACA Program. It was very clear to me that what the people in that meeting were looking for was leadership in Washington that rec-ognized that it is in our national inter-est for us to provide the type of legal protection to these individuals who have made America their home—who took the risk to come here for a better life for their families. These individuals came to this coun-try—the Dreamers, who are the chil-dren, particularly—when they came with their parents. It was the parents’ decision to try to find a better life for their children. They know only Amer-ica as their country. They do not know the countries from which they have come. America is their own home. They have helped to build this great Nation. They have attended our schools. They have joined our military. They have joined our workforce. They are, truly, the future of America. The DACA Program, which recently celebrated its fifth anniversary, pro-vided protection for these Dreamers against their arbitrary removal. It ap-plied only to those who had come to this country when they were younger than 16 years of age. They had to have been here before January 2007. They had to have gone through a background check to make sure that they had not violated any of our criminal statutes, and they had to have been enrolled in schools or our military. It was really dealing with young people who were in-nocent with regard to any of the viola-tions of our immigration laws. It really dealt with individuals who had come to this country and had been part of America. The DACA Program provided not only protection against their removal but gave them protection in the work-force. They were given documentation so that they could legally work here in the United States and get the protec-tion of our labor laws and not be sub-jected to an underground economy or the abuses in the workforce that we sometimes see among immigrant fami-lies. So 800,000 children have taken ad-vantage of the DACA Program. In my State of Maryland, 10,000 are registered under the DACA Program. Then came President Trump’s deci-sion this past week to terminate the program in 6 months—terminate it now, as far as new DACA registra-tions—but to terminate this program. That immediately created uncertainty and fear for 800,000 individuals in this country and their families. President Trump’s decision is tragic in three ways. First, it has the poten-tial of ripping families apart—800,000 people here in the United States. It creates uncertainty for those who are currently in the DACA Program. It cre-ates fear as to what tomorrow will bring, and it will drive many of these individuals into the shadows, into the underground, into protecting them-selves against the enforcement of re-moval. This decision by President Trump is tragic for a second reason. It will hurt our economy. The numbers in Mary-land I think are somewhere around one-half of $1 billion to our State GDP from the Dreamers alone. The Dreamers are part of our econ-omy. They are adding to our economy. I got a phone call from one of our major employers in Maryland express-ing grave concern about President Trump’s decision and the impact it will have on that company and on our econ-omy. These are individuals who have been trained in our schools, who have gone to our colleges, who have served in our military, and who are now add-ing to the economic strength of Amer-ica through their employment and their innovation. It makes no sense from the point of view of our economy. The third reason the President’s deci-sion is tragic is one that speaks to the strength of America—what makes America the great Nation it is. Yes, we are proud of those who serve in our military. We know that we have the strongest military in the world, and we are very proud of the way our military protects this country and provides global leadership. Yes, we are very proud of our economy and what it pro-duces and the economic growth it pro-vides for the people in this country and its engagement in the global economy. But what really makes America the unique, strong Nation that it is are our values, including what we stand for, our democratic institutions, the fact that we are the beacon of hope for peo-ple all over the world for providing op-portunity. People can come to this country with dreams, and those dreams can become reality. That is what America’s values are about. President Trump’s decision to end the DACA Program runs afoul of the principles that have made America the great Nation it is—a safe haven for those who are seeking refuge from per-secution, a nation that embraces diver-sity and recognizes diversity as our strength. President Trump’s decision to end the DACA Program runs afoul of

America’s core values. It weakens us as a nation and certainly weakens our ability to lead globally with our values as we present them to the global com-munity. So, as a result of that decision, what do we need to do? Each one of us needs to stand up and be counted, to speak out about America and what makes this Nation the great Nation it is. Then, collectively, we need to take ac-tion to show the American people that we will stand up not just for the Dreamers—and we need to stand up for the Dreamers—but we will also stand up for the values that have made America the great Nation it is. I support S. 1615, a bipartisan bill that has been introduced by Senator D
URBIN and Senator G RAHAM . I thank both of our colleagues for their leader-ship in bringing that bill forward. That bill will provide protection for the Dreamers and for the DACA Program so that Congress can say: No, Mr. President, we do not want to terminate this program. This program is in our national security interests. This pro-gram is why America is the strong Na-tion that it is. It is not only right for 800,000 people; it is right for all people in this country. This body showed great leadership a few years ago when we passed com-prehensive immigration reform. I am for passing comprehensive immigration reform. Let’s take care of and protect the Dreamers, and then let’s work to-gether to pass comprehensive immigra-tion reform that we did just a few years ago that was never taken up in the House of Representatives. Let me close by telling a few stories about Dreamers in Maryland. One story appeared in the Baltimore Sun. It begins: 
Jesus Perez doesn’t remember much about his journey to the United States two decades ago, beyond his parents using a simple phrase that would change the course of his life: ‘‘We’re leaving.’’ Perez was 5 when he left Mexico. He’s never been back. Perez [is] now a 25-year-old research assist-ant at the Johns Hopkins University in Bal-timore. For Perez, the DACA program was a ‘‘re-lief’’ that allowed him to come out of the shadows. It also allowed him to take the job at Hopkins, and to get a standard driver’s li-cense. ‘‘To now have it in limbo means that you either lose it all, and restart all over again—’’ Perez said, trailing off. ‘‘I’m not going to let that happen. We will win in the end.’’ 
I want Mr. Perez to know that we are going to fight here in the U.S. Senate, not just for his ability to remain here in the United States but for what that means for the strength of our country. Our university community in Mary-land has strongly supported the DACA Program. Dr. Loh, president of the Uni-versity of Maryland, College Park, called the decision ‘‘antithetical to the core values’’ of higher education. He vowed in a letter to students and staff to ‘‘continue to identify all avenues available for offering support.’’ Johns Hopkins University President Ron Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar reaffirmed the university’s support for DACA, saying that Johns Hopkins Uni-versity students directly impacted by the decision will be given the aid they need to complete their degrees. Presi-dent Daniels and Provost Kumar said: ‘‘The decision on DACA will not deter us from working to ensure that all members of our community can par-ticipate fully in our mission—the pur-suit of excellence in education, dis-covery and service to the world.’’ As President Loh and President Dan-iels fight on behalf of the DACA chil-dren, we need to also let the American people know that we are going to fight for what makes this Nation the great Nation that it is. The Baltimore Sun also told the story of Monica Perez, who is one of dozens of Dreamers from Maryland who rallied near the White House on Tues-day to protest the decision. The 23- year-old Baltimore woman came to the United States from Mexico when she was 7 years old. Ms. Perez said DACA ‘‘gave us the opportunity to feel safe. We’ve already been in the shadows for so long.’’ Ms. Perez works for CASA de Maryland. ‘‘I’m just scared for my parents, for myself, and for my whole community.’’ Mr. President, let us do the right thing and immediately extend the DACA Program. These are not 800,000 faceless individuals. I urge all of my colleagues to get to know the Dream-ers and to understand their life story. It is heart-wrenching—the courage that they have shown, the obstacles they have overcome. Let’s not put ob-stacles in their way. Let’s allow their dreams to be able to come true. Let’s stand up and be counted and fight for the Dreamers. Let’s work together to protect their status, and then let’s work together to fix our broken immi-gration system. That is our responsi-bility. This is our opportunity. Let’s work together to get this done. With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DACA Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud Michigander, Amer-ican, and the son of an immigrant. My mother Madeleine grew up in France and met my father Herb when he was serving overseas during World War II. They fell in love, were married, and she had the opportunity to immigrate to the United States where she started a new life with my dad and was proud to become a new citizen of the United States of America. She worked hard as a nurse’s aide and a union steward, and she provided inspiration and opportunity for me and my sisters. And, because the Detroit Tigers don’t have a game on TV at this moment, I hope that she is home in Rochester watching me speak right now. My mother’s American experience in-forms my views on the nearly 7,000 Michiganders who have benefited from the protection of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. Let’s look at the facts. The young men and women known as Dreamers and who are helped by DACA are stu-dents, serve in the military, launch new businesses, create jobs, and boost economic growth. These Dreamers did not choose to come to this country; they were brought here by their par-ents. They have no meaningful connec-tions to the foreign countries they left as children and often don’t even speak the language. They know no home other than the United States of Amer-ica, and they were raised as Americans. They have passed extensive back-ground checks, paid fines, and continue to pay taxes, which reduces our budget deficit. They pay into Social Security, which increases its solvency for all Americans. According to the CATO Institute, de-porting the more than 700,000 DACA participants would cost—yes, cost—the Federal Government over $60 billion and reduce economic growth in this country by $280 billion over the next decade. Rescinding DACA is not just cruel and unfair, it is a terrible economic policy and a bad deal for the American taxpayer. Numbers can only say so much, so I often tell the story of a fellow Michi-gander, Ola Kaso. Ola is pictured right here. Ola’s family came to the United States legally but unsuccessfully seek-ing asylum in 1998. Ola was only 5 years old when she came to America. After 13 years in the country—13 years—the government attempted to deport her and her mother back to Albania, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school. Backed by the sup-port of fellow Michiganders, Ola’s fam-ily was granted a stay of the deporta-tion. I am proud to report that Ola ulti-mately graduated as the valedictorian of her high school class. She recently graduated from the University of Michigan and plans to attend medical school. She is a beneficiary of the DACA Program. Our Nation is facing a doctor short-age—especially in rural areas—and this young woman wants to dedicate her

life to caring for others. Deporting Ola makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. As a country that seeks the best and brightest, we should not spend tax-payer dollars to deport contributing members of our society, especially when they were brought here through no fault of their own and when they voluntarily came out of the shadows through DACA. Let me be clear. I strongly disagree with President Trump’s decision to re-scind the DACA Program. Congress must provide leadership and help these young people who are giving back to our country. We must provide them with the certainty they deserve and take a positive step forward toward re-forming our broken immigration sys-tem. We must move beyond the politics of scarcity and division. The Dreamers are not taking away limited American jobs; they are cre-ating new jobs and growing our econ-omy. They are creating jobs with their own small businesses, helping Amer-ican entrepreneurs grow their compa-nies as they expand in their commu-nities, and fighting to keep us safe as members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Our Nation needs more innovators, doers, and dreamers, not fewer. I will fight for Ola and all of the Dreamers who make this country bet-ter, stronger, and more prosperous for all Americans—not just because it is good for our bottom line but because it is simply the right thing to do. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. E

HURRICANES HARVEY AND IRMA Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, for better or worse, history repeats itself— sometimes much sooner than we would like. We now know that Florida offi-cials, as well as those up the east coast of the United States, have begun order-ing evacuations as Hurricane Irma has intensified into a category 5 storm which could make landfall this week-end. It is my sincere hope that all resi-dents of Florida will be safe, as well as those in other States affected by Irma, and that they take proper precautions. If there is one thing we learned from Hurricane Harvey, it is the importance of listening to local officials and lead-ers when it comes to evacuations and precautionary measures. But whatever happens, we are going to stand by the people of Florida and the Carolinas and others affected, just as they have stood by us in Texas and Louisiana as a re-sult of Hurricane Harvey. In the mean-time, we pray that Irma’s trajectory changes. Down in Texas, of course, we are still thinking about another hurricane, and that is, of course, Hurricane Harvey. It is hard to believe, but not even 2 weeks have passed since the storm first tore through our towns, great and small. Of course, communities are still reeling from the devastation. One I visited earlier this week is the Meyerland neighborhood in Houston. It has been flooded three times in 3 years. On Monday, I visited the home of a sin-gle mom who survived several recent storms unscathed, but this time, Har-vey found her home and destroyed it. There is a pile of debris on her front lawn, ready to be picked up by dump trucks. As a matter of fact, as you drive down the street, house after house after house, there are piles of furniture, clothing, drywall, and other debris that has been pulled up and dis-carded and is ready to be picked up by the dump trucks. Throughout the re-gion, there are piles like that stacked up in Rockport, Aransas Pass, Lake Jackson, and West Columbia. As re-cently as this week, let’s remember, some of these places were still under mandatory evacuation orders as the rivers crested and higher waters moved downstream. But here is my main point: As the rubble piles up and up and up, it is sometimes hard to see past the wreck-age of the past weeks. Sometimes it is hard to see beyond what is right in front of you. That is why some simple words by historian David McCullough are good to keep in mind at times like this, as we continue to deal with Har-vey’s aftermath and worry what might follow with Irma. McCullough said: We think we live in difficult, uncertain times. We think we have worries. We think our leaders face difficult decisions. But so it has nearly always been. 
He is right. We have been through tough times before. We certainly have been through tough times in storms like Harvey in Texas before. As a mat-ter of fact, back almost a little over a century ago, on September 8, 1900, a hurricane like Harvey—a category 4 hurricane—slammed into the city of Galveston, with winds surpassing 135 miles per hour. Two-thirds of the city was destroyed, and approximately 10,000 people lost their lives—10,000 peo-ple. By comparison, so far the death toll of Harvey is 70. So we can be grate-ful the death toll that was experienced in Galveston was not repeated. Like Galveston, the city of Houston and the surrounding area will recover. Of course, back in 1900, it took a cou-ple of days for the world to find out what had happened because commu-nication was not what it is now, but when word finally spread, America no-ticed. One little girl in Chicago sent 10 cents to help because that was all she had—10 cents. Well, that was probably worth a lot more back then than it is now, but it certainly is a lot for a little child. Her story reminds me of a 5- year-old boy in Philadelphia I heard about last week who set up a lemonade stand. Wearing a ‘‘Houston Texans’’ hat, he raised more than $400 for vic-tims of Hurricane Harvey. How re-markable. What has changed since Galveston? Quite a bit. One crucial difference is that we have gotten a lot better at dis-aster prediction and response. As a matter of fact, my State—from the Governor on down to our local offi-cials—plans for disasters like these and anticipates them, and it is that plan-ning which has reduced the loss of life and gotten people out of harm’s way. Houston’s $503 billion economy will hopefully bounce back quickly, and with our help, it should. The fourth largest city in the country is known for energy, and that is what we here in Washington must devote to ensuring that aid relief is expedited. Supple-mental funding to aid the Harvey re-covery needs to be voted on promptly. Our friends in the House did it yester-day, and now it will be our turn this afternoon. The Senate will soon consider legis-lation that will keep the government’s lights on until December 8 and increase the Nation’s borrowing capacity. This is important because without lifting the debt limit, we couldn’t vote for and send aid to the victims of Harvey be-cause we would be bumping up against the debt ceiling. More importantly, this afternoon we will consider $15 billion in new emer-gency funds. These will be available to Texas families who, like the woman I met in Meyerland, are removing their rugs and furniture and rebuilding the very walls of their homes. These funds include $7.4 billion to FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, as well as $7.4 billion to HUD’s Community Development Block Grant Program and $450 million for the Small Business Administration Dis-aster Loan Program. As large as these numbers are, with more than 100,000 people who have ac-tually lost their homes, this is a down-payment, unfortunately, on what will be additional costs that Congress will have to vote on. As a matter of fact, after Hurricane Katrina, Congress voted on seven separate supplemental appropriations before the job was done. As I said, these are large numbers but not in the context of this unprece-dented hurricane which dropped 50 inches of rain in 5 days on the city of Houston and the surrounding area. I hope my colleagues will keep in mind the scope of this catastrophe and de-liver this funding to those whom Har-vey has cost much more than just dol-lars. Getting back to the Texas economy, which I mentioned just a second ago, I want to talk about how important it is to get my State back up and running, because it is so important to the U.S. economy. As columnist Brett Stephens wrote last week, ‘‘Economic growth isn’t just a matter of parking lots paving over paradise.’’ Companies oftentimes do real, tangible good. What matters for us today is that they underwrite safety

standards and fund scientific research, and they develop new technologies to warn us of impending storms and engi-neer new materials that make build-ings more secure. That is probably one of the biggest reasons why the damage from Hurricane Harvey didn’t compare to the damage from the Galveston hur-ricane of 1900—because of building standards, building codes, and new ma-terials that have been devised to help make buildings more secure. That is why Harvey wasn’t like Galveston in 1900, and in the days and weeks ahead, we need to remember how far we have come. That is not to say we still don’t have a long way to go. While the strong Texas economy is crucial to recovery efforts, education will be too. Thousands of Texas school-children have been displaced by Hurri-cane Harvey, and many public school children are still wondering when their classrooms will be opened, if at all, or whether they will simply be trans-ferred to other schools because their schools literally do not exist anymore. Yesterday, I spoke with Mike Morath, commissioner of Texas public education, who told me about the many challenges schools in Texas are now facing. For example, an entire school district in Rockport, TX, is closed indefinitely, leaving more than 3,000 students without friends and teachers to go to school with. In the Houston Independent School District, more than 200 schools were affected by the flooding, with at least 50 suffering extensive damage. Our healthcare facilities are also dealing with other concerns. Bill McKeon, president of the Texas Med-ical Center—one of the largest medical centers in the world—told us that his employees had problems getting to work due to road closures, debris, and families without homes and vehicles. When your office is in the world’s big-gest medical complex and employs more than 100,000 people, that is a big problem. It is a big problem, but we are going to deal with it. Like Galveston in 1900, like New Or-leans after Katrina, these storms hum-ble us but provide us the way to show the human spirit and ingenuity that so routinely follows as we rebuild and re-cover. Once again, David McCullough’s words are useful. He said: ‘‘A sense of history is an antidote to self-pity and self-importance.’’ Colleagues, let’s keep in mind those wise words of David McCullough as we weather this storm and brace ourselves for the next. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. NORTH KOREA Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, I am here today to urge the White House and the National Security Council to develop and deliver to Congress a clear, comprehensive U.S. strategy to address the urgent threat posed by North Ko-rea’s nuclear missile program. I have submitted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act—the annual national defense bill that we will consider soon—requiring that strategy within 90 days, and I hope all of my colleagues will support it when the time comes. I am honored to colead two Senate panels that have been focused on this threat for years: the Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces— where I work with my colleague Sen-ator F
ISCHER to oversee our Nation’s nuclear arsenal, missile defense sys-tems, and nuclear nonproliferation pro-grams—and the Banking Sub-committee on National Security and International Trade and Finance, where I work with Senator B
ENSASSE to oversee the development and en-forcement of U.S. sanctions laws. In my role on these two panels, I have traveled to South Korea, the DMZ, and China. I have met with U.S. forces and foreign leaders to discuss our challenges and our options for overcoming them. I have worked with colleagues—both Republican and Democratic—to shape legislation to improve our homeland defenses, strengthen our military, and expand our sanctions in response to Kim Jong Un’s dangerous behavior. I have sat in dozens of meetings, hearings, and clas-sified briefings on the subject of North Korea’s nuclear program and what we can do about it. Just yesterday, every Member of the Senate had the opportunity to attend one of these briefings and hear from the leaders of the Pentagon, the State Department, and the Intelligence Com-munity about our various efforts against Kim Jong Un. I am sorry to say I walked away from yesterday’s brief-ing with the same concern I had after every briefing on this subject in the past 8 months. We have operational plans for our military and scattered talks among our diplomats, but we need a substantive strategy. With each passing week—at times, with each passing day—North Korea is making its intentions clear and its progress toward a nuclear-capable ICBM known to the entire world. We see missile tests with growing ranges, warhead tests with growing yields, test shots that fly over the territory of our allies, and threats that target U.S. ter-ritories. Kim Jong Un says he wants to shoot a nuclear-armed missile into the U.S. mainland. I take him at his word, as we all should. In times like this, it is critical every move we make be a deliberate one that moves the ball forward toward the out-come we want, the outcome we need to achieve. We should be doing everything in our power to do that in a way that will not put America’s sons and daugh-ters, moms and dads, brothers and sis-ters who make up our Nation’s mili-tary in harm’s way unnecessarily. There are more than 20,000 U.S. serv-icemembers in South Korea. At last count, more than 300 of them were from my home State of Indiana. An-other 40,000 U.S. troops are in Japan and nearly 4,000 on Guam, not to men-tion the thousands of sailors and ma-rines aboard our vessels at sea in the region. I have every confidence in the ability of these men and women to defend our Nation, but we owe it to them to make every appropriate effort to end this conflict in a way that doesn’t unneces-sarily put their lives at risk. We talk a lot about a whole-of-gov-ernment effort. That is not what we are seeing right now when it comes to our response to North Korea. I see a Treasury Department that needs to dramatically step up its sanctions en-forcement to not just induce pain but to cripple North Korea’s ability to progress further on its nuclear pro-gram. I see a diplomatic corps grappling with the top national security priority in the Pacific—bar none—lacking the resources, the guidance, and the back-ing from Washington to do their jobs. I see a U.S. Embassy in Seoul with no Ambassador. I see a State Department without key positions filled in various areas, including arms control, non-proliferation, and Asian affairs. I see a Defense Department without an Assist-ant Secretary for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities—or, for that matter, an Assistant Secretary for Asian and Pa-cific Security Affairs. We can do better, and we must do better. This is not a partisan critique. It is not fearmongering. It is not a call to arms. This is my effort to speak on this floor, before my colleagues and the country—a request we have all made to the White House many times. Give us a strategy on North Korea and let our country unite behind it. The country is looking for leadership on this. The world is looking for lead-ership. Let’s define our objectives based on the best interest and safety of our country and our allies and develop our strategy to achieve it. Let us work together across departments and agen-cies, across branches of government, and across party lines to get there. This is way too important to not do that. No more mixed messages. No more bluster. We have to act. We can’t afford to waste our efforts in chaos and disarray. We have to continue improv-ing our missile defenses and be pre-pared to use them to protect our terri-tory, the territory of our allies, and all of our people. We have to sanction Chinese banks that do business with North Korea. We have to cut off the lifelines of the Kim regime, including oil supplies and for-eign currency—not to topple the gov-ernment but to eliminate their ability to continue down this murderous path.

We have to be doing far more to get our partners in the region to do more— allies and competitors alike—in service of a goal we all share. There is ample support for all of these efforts in Con-gress. Senator F
ISCHER and I worked to-gether to provide even more funding for missile defense than the President requested because it is so important. Senator S
ASSE and I have worked to-gether to gather options from some of the Nation’s best and brightest minds on how to shape sanctions that could actually impact North Korea’s ability to continue their nuclear program, whether Kim Jong Un agrees to it or not. I believe there will be ample support among our allies—and even our adver-saries—around the world if we provide the kind of clear, forceful, and effective leadership America has always been known for in the past. There is not a nation on Earth that is safer with the existence of North Ko-rea’s nuclear weapons program, and that includes North Korea itself. How-ever hard the path forward may be, we can all agree that the status quo is not enough. It is not even close and will not continue to work. We cannot fix that without a strat-egy. I am here today asking the admin-istration—once again, reaching out our hand to them—to take that first essen-tial step forward and asking my col-leagues to support my amendment to the national defense bill to require the administration to submit a North Korea strategy to Congress within 90 days. We can do this together. I yield back.

f 
FINDING COMMON GROUND Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before we adjourned for the recess, I came to this lectern to issue a call for comity, co-operation, and compromise. My mes-sage that day was simple: If we are se-rious about legislating—if we are truly committed to doing the work the American people sent us here to do— then we must look beyond the horizon of our differences and find common ground. Since January, this Congress has been its own worst enemy. It has been mired in the muck of its own making, bogged down by partisan squabbles and gripped by gridlock—the likes of which I have never seen in all my years of public service. I wish I could say the situation across the country is better, but sadly it isn’t. The polarization we see in the Senate is only indicative of the division we see all around the Na-tion. The events of August threw that division into sharp relief, but it also showed us our ability to heal—our re-markable capacity to lay aside super-ficial differences in moments of crisis to come together as one. In Charlottesville and Houston, Au-gust brought us a tale of two cities— one that showed us at once both the weaknesses and strengths of our great country. In Charlottesville, we saw the worst of America on full display. In the vio-lence, vitriol, and vulgar racism of Nazi demonstrators, we stared evil in the face, and in the terrorist attack that ensued, we saw the ideology of ha-tred brought to its logical endpoint. None of us will soon forget this attack on innocent civilians. I am sure, in the stagnant human air of that hot sum-mer’s day, we caught a glimpse of the darkness buried deep in the soul of America. Charlottesville was more than a trag-ic event. It was a gut-check moment for all Americans. It was a national low point that demanded all of us to take stock of where we are as a society and where our rhetoric is taking us. The men who perpetrated this hor-rific act of violence—whether by their words or by their actions—represent the dregs of a dying culture, but if the violence in Charlottesville showed America at its worst, then the rescue and recovery efforts in hurricane-rav-aged Houston showed our country at its best. Just 2 weeks after the brutality in Charlottesville, our Nation again watched in horror as Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, unleashing a flood of biblical proportions. Relentless rainfall battered the coast for days, leaving in its wake a trail of destruc-tion and shattered life. Harvey left behind unprecedented devastation, but it also gave us count-less stories of hope and heroism. On na-tional TV, we saw a weatherman rush-ing to the aid of a stranded driver, pull-ing the man to safety before the cur-rent could take him away. We saw ev-eryday Texans wade in the neck-deep waters to form a human chain, saving the life of a stranger trapped in his car. We watched as three teenage boys navi-gated the streets of Houston in a fish-ing boat, driving from house to house to rescue their neighbors as the flood-waters poured in. These are just a few stories among thousands more. These stories remind us of the hope and humanity borne of tragedy. They bear testament to the innate goodness of the American peo-ple, and they show us that, in moments of crisis, our capacity to come together for the good of our communities is really unparalleled. Tragedies like those in Houston strip us of all that is superfluous, leaving be-hind only our common humanity. In the moments of peril that moved tens of thousands of Texans to band to-gether to save their city, consider-ations of race, religion, class, or creed fell into complete irrelevance. The first responders, volunteers, and Good Sa-maritans who put their own lives at risk to rescue others served indiscrimi-nately. They took no thought for whom they were helping—what their back-ground or beliefs were. Houston’s he-roes saw only lives that needed saving, and they went to work. If there is any good that comes of tragedy, it is that for a brief but beau-tiful moment, we are able to see each other as we truly are—not as Repub-licans or Democrats, rich or poor, Black or White, but as members of the same community, partakers of the same human condition and children of the same God. For a brief moment, we are able to see each other as Ameri-cans. I pray that the hope of Houston may inspire all of us here in the Senate. I pray that we may look to the city’s ex-ample in the work we have before us, setting aside our petty partisan dif-ferences to come together for the good of the Nation. I pray that, as Senators, we might see each other as friends and equals, partners and patriots, anx-iously engaged in the important work of legislating. I pray that we can es-teem each other by our mutual love for this great country, not by the R or D that follows our names. Now, more than ever, we need strength and unity here in the Senate. The challenges we have before us are enormous. In the next few weeks alone, we need to secure emergency relief funding for the victims of Hurricane Harvey, raise the debt ceiling, fix our broken Tax Code, and find a way for-ward on immigration reform. Our to-do list just keeps growing. Each of these items taken on its own is challenging, but taken as a whole, our agenda is daunting. But I truly be-lieve we are up to the task. I truly be-lieve we can step up to the plate, just as the people of Texas did, to tackle the challenges before us. As I said before we broke for recess, the Senate is capable of so much more. I know because I have seen the Senate at its best. I have seen the Senate when it truly lived up to its reputation as the world’s greatest deliberative body. I believe we can again see this body at its best. My central message today is simple. We can do hard things. I know because we have done them before. So let’s make laws, not excuses. Let’s move forward on an agenda that puts the needs of America’s families front and center. This is an important pivotal time in our Nation’s history. It is up to us to

make that pivotal time an important time, a successful time, and one where we are brought together to work as col-leagues, rather than as opponents, which it has been far too much, as far as I am concerned, over the last num-ber of years. I hope that we can all get together and do a better job for America. I yield the floor The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Pennsylvania.

DACA Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for just a few minutes about the Dreamers in our country, the young people about whom we have had a debate recently and will continue to debate about with regard to the so- called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known by the acro-nym DACA. The United States is a proud nation of immigrants, and ending this pro-gram does not make sense either mor-ally or in terms of our economy. Re-scinding the program will cost the United States jobs. It will hurt our na-tional security, and it is a total be-trayal of the trust of the Federal Gov-ernment. Dreamers are young people who have lived in our country for a long time, since they were children. They have been law-abiding residents, they have learned English, and they pay taxes. They have secured jobs that support themselves and their families. Our Government promised them that they would be protected if they came forward, and now the administration is breaking that promise. President Trump’s actions with regard to DACA are an insult to America and are an in-sult to American values. This action is unjust, it is immoral, and it is without regard for basic fairness. Tearing apart the lives of these young people will make our Nation less safe and will harm our economy. Ending DACA also does not make sense financially. In Pennsylvania alone, estimates are that ending DACA would cost Pennsylvania $357 million per year in GDP losses. Nationwide, the number is $460 billion from the GDP over the next decade. Ending DACA would remove approximately 685,000 workers from the U.S. economy. According to the Cato Institute, de-porting DACA residents would cost more than $60 billion. Finally, the In-stitute on Taxation and Economic Pol-icy estimates that 1.3 million young people enrolled in or eligible for DACA pay some $2 billion each year in State and local taxes. Let me just share one story of many about a Dreamer that I met. In this case, it was back in April of this year. I was proud to meet with this indi-vidual from Lancaster. Her name is Au-drey Lopez. Audrey is one of those Dreamers. She came to the United States as a child with her parents, who were seeking a better life for her and for her family. She grew up in Pennsyl-vania and graduated from college. The United States is the only home she knows. When I met Audrey, she was worried about the debate about immigration and immigration policy. The debate that we have been having in Wash-ington mostly since January of this year was causing great fear and uncer-tainty in her community. Audrey is ob-viously concerned about the immigra-tion debate and, in particular, what happens with DACA. She has worked with Church World Services, an organization that helps re-settle hundreds of refugees each year in Pennsylvania. They provide services to help new arrivals adjust to their new home and become successful members of their local neighborhoods. Audrey is now a student at American University, pursuing her master’s de-gree in international development—of course, after getting a college edu-cation as well. This is America. This is who we are as a nation, where young people like Audrey have a chance to work hard and to succeed, to get an education and to contribute to the American economy and to the fabric of our society. We are a country in which hard-working young people who are working to bet-ter themselves and their community are given a chance to do so, in a sense, fulfilling or living that dream. This program, DACA, has allowed al-most 800,000 young people whose stories are very similar to Audrey’s to grow up and thrive in America. It makes no sense to heartlessly remove Dreamers from a country they call home. In response to President Trump’s de-cision to end DACA, Congress should move immediately to pass a bipartisan Dream Act. This bill will allow Dream-ers to become permanent residents if they meet the very stringent qualifica-tions outlined in the bill. In Pennsyl-vania alone, 5,900 people have been granted DACA status. Passing the Dream Act will give these people the security they need and a future they can count on. We should be focused on humane and commonsense solutions that keep our Nation safe and allow it to thrive. I was proud to vote for the DREAM Act in 2007 and 2010. I hope we will have a clean vote on the Dream Act very soon. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arizona. Mr. M
CCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Sen-ate as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. M
CCAIN. Madam President, like all of us, I would like to join with our fellow citizens and colleagues in ex-pressing our deep condolences to the victims of Hurricane Harvey. All Amer-icans stand with the people of Texas who have been devastated by this ter-rible storm as they work to recover and rebuild their communities. My thoughts and prayers are also with the people of Florida as they pre-pare for Hurricane Irma. I urge every-one in the path of this horrible storm to pay attention to instructions from local officials to stay safe. In the aftermath of Hurricane Har-vey, I am pleased that the legislation before us includes $15 billion in emer-gency funding to help the people of Texas put their lives back together. Congress should and must provide this needed relief. In due time, if the devastation of Irma is anywhere near as bad as pre-dicted, obviously I and others will sup-port sending Federal funding to assist the people of Florida with recovery. That is clearly a requirement and func-tion of government. Madam President, I also support in-creasing the debt ceiling as a necessary way to prevent default on our govern-ment debt. However, I cannot in good conscience support those very impor-tant pieces of this legislation if it also means supporting a continuing resolu-tion. I have come to this floor many times to talk about the harmful effects of continuing resolutions on our military. Year after year, we have lurched from one short-term fix to another without doing the hard work of governing and budgeting. And year after year, I have reminded my colleagues that con-tinuing resolutions are not only no way to fund the government, they in-flict great harm upon those Americans we are constitutionally obliged to pro-vide for, and that is our men and women in uniform. Our defense leaders have also sound-ed the alarm. For the last several years, our senior military and civilian leaders have come to the Senate Armed Services Committee and asked for the same thing: that Congress provide sta-ble, predictable funding and that we provide it on time. Is that a lot to ask, stable and predictable funding, and providing it on time? In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee this year, Secretary Mattis pointed out that ‘‘during nine of the past ten years, Congress has enacted 30 separate Con-tinuing Resolutions to fund the De-partment of Defense, thus inhibiting our readiness and adaptation to new challenges.’’ He asked Congress to ‘‘pass a FY 2018 budget in a timely manner to avoid yet another harmful Continuing Resolution.’’ Let me explain. A continuing resolu-tion just continues and continues at previous years’ levels. I will talk about some of the impacts continuing resolu-tions have had. The Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dunford, also stated that ‘‘without sustained, sufficient, and predictable funding, I assess that within 5 years we will lose our ability to project power; the basis of how we defend the homeland, advance U.S. in-terests, and meet our alliance commit-ments.’’ My friends and colleagues, that doesn’t come from Senator J

CCAIN, it comes from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that without predictable funding, within 5 years, we will lose our ability to project power, the basis of how we defend the home-land, et cetera. I shouldn’t have to remind everyone that threats are on the rise around the world. Global terrorist networks, in-creasing great power competition with Russia and China, malign Iranian influ-ence spreading across the Middle East, a North Korean dictator racing to ac-quire missiles that can hit the United States with nuclear weapons—the threats to our national security have not been more complex or daunting than at any time in the past seven dec-ades. Let us not forget that we are a na-tion at war. There are brave young men and women serving in Afghani-stan, Iraq, and other places. We must always ask ourselves, are we really doing all we can to support them? There is no point to discussing our strategy for Afghanistan or North Korea or ISIS or any of the other myr-iad of threats we are currently facing if we are simply going to fund the mili-tary through a continuing resolution. My friends, the state of our military is dire. The overwhelming majority of our forces are not fit for combat in the near term. Three out of our fifty-nine Army brigades are combat-ready. Four of sixty-four Air Force squadrons are ready to ‘‘fight tonight’’—that means fully combat ready. Fewer than half of the Marine and Navy planes are ready for combat. The Air Force has a pilot shortfall of 1,500, 1,000 of whom are fighter pilots. The Navy has a mainte-nance backlog of 5.4 million man-days scheduled for 2017. The hard truth is, our military is de-clining. The President of the United States campaigned with a full commit-ment of rebuilding our military. If we do a continuing resolution, we are not only not rebuilding our military, we are harming our military. The hard truth is, the military is de-clining. For evidence of this, we need look no further than all the headlines about ship collisions and aviation acci-dents during peacetime training oper-ations—incidents that have tragically taken the lives of dozens of our brave men and women in uniform. The inci-dent involving USS McCain, which killed 10 young sailors, is only the lat-est example. So how did we get here? How did we get into this position? Uncertain budg-ets that are consistently late. Con-tinuing to increase the operational tempo for our military despite not hav-ing sufficient money to pay for it. Making cuts elsewhere to stay afloat, like training and maintenance. And we are about to do the same thing. Appar-ently, watching as young men and women die for entirely avoidable rea-sons seems not to be enough for us to change. To be sure, while the budget alone will not fix all of the underlying causes of the recent incidents, the military cannot improve without timely and growing budgets. Yet that is exactly what a CR—a continuing resolution— will not provide. A continuing resolu-tion will lock the Department of De-fense into last year’s funding levels, it will prevent them from reprogramming funding to meet emerging needs, and it will prohibit the start of new programs to modernize for future threats. Per-haps worst of all, a continuing resolu-tion will mandate a level of spending $52 billion less than the President’s budget request. The military cannot fix its readiness problems without more funding. The military cannot grow its forces to meet the expanding requirements of a global threat environment under a continuing resolution. A continuing resolution will not allow our military to mod-ernize its forces to ensure we maintain our strategic advantage over our com-petitors. While the President and this Con-gress understand that the military does have a need for additional funding to rebuild the military, we are asking them to keep treading water for 3 months for no reason whatsoever. A continuing resolution is a crutch we

rely on when we cannot pass actual ap-propriations bills. It is a temporary so-lution to avoid the worst possible out-come—a Federal shutdown—and to allow us more time to reach a solution for funding the government. The majority of us can agree that passing continuing resolutions is not the proper way of funding government. Congress cannot perform oversight by passing continuing resolutions. The Federal Government cannot execute ef-fectively or efficiently when locked into last year’s funding bills. Having to pass a continuing resolution, by all ac-counts, is a failure by the Congress of the United States to fund the Federal Government. I understand the need to use these from time to time as bipartisan spend-ing agreements are not always easy to come by. What I do not understand is why we are voting on a continuing res-olution 3 weeks before the actual start of the next year without having spent any time in the Senate on actually try-ing to pass an appropriations bill or ne-gotiating a bipartisan budget agree-ment. How is it that we are voting on a continuing resolution—a mechanism of last resort—before we have even made a single attempt at funding the government? There has been no discussion of a bi-partisan budget deal. There has not even been a fiscal year 2018 budget res-olution. We have not called up a single 2018 appropriations bill—not a single one for 2018. Quite simply, we have not been doing our jobs. If we are going to call ourselves the world’s greatest de-liberative body, we have to do one heck of a lot better. We have 3 weeks before we need to pass fiscal year 2018 fund-ing. Why have we given up before hav-ing even tried? We could be spending this month debating a bipartisan budg-et deal we all know we will now need to pass in December. Attaching emergency funding for hurricane relief to a must-pass con-tinuing resolution and debt limit in-crease is irresponsible and a dereliction of our most routine duties. It is the re-sult of yet another self-inflicted—I re-peat, self-inflicted—crisis. Instead of returning to the regular order by mov-ing individual spending bills to fund our government and our national secu-rity priorities, with ample time for de-bate and amendments, we are shirking our responsibilities and kicking the can down the road. All of us are respon-sible for the detriment to the men and women serving in our military during a time of incredible global uncertainty. I would like to vote to provide assist-ance to the people of Texas. I cannot vote for another continuing resolution that will harm our men and women in uniform. Quite often, I go to where we have conflicts—Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other countries in the region. I can tell you that these young men and women who are serving in uni-form, under difficult and challenging circumstances, are not being provided with the support, the weapons, the strategy, or, most of all, the funding that is necessary. Yes, we have been in this conflict for many years. The main reason the con-flict is not over is, we never had a strategy by which to win. Now we have a national security team that has a strategy to win, but they cannot do it without the tools they need to win but also do their best to protect the lives of these young men and women who are literally placing their lives on the line. Meanwhile, what do we do? We decide that by December 15, maybe we will take up a continuing resolution. We may take certain action. Meanwhile, we are not providing the men and women in the military with what they need not only to win but to do every-thing we can to ensure that we have provided them with every possible means of protecting their own health and welfare. I say to my colleagues, we have seen this movie before. We are lurching down the road to December 15—Decem-ber 8, I think it has been changed to now—when everybody will be eager to get out of town and go home for one’s undeserved Christmas holiday break. The point is, today we should be taking up the budget, taking up our appropria-tions bills, and moving forward. If peo-ple want to block it, fine. Then let’s stay in tonight. Let’s stay in on Friday and Saturday and Sunday. Let’s do something really unusual. The men and women who are serving over there, whom we are supposed to be taking care of, do not leave on Thursday after-noon and go back on Monday. They are out there, putting themselves on the line for us every single hour of every single day, and they deserve a lot bet-ter than what they are getting from this administration and this Congress, where the Republican Party has the majority. I urge my colleagues again, Why don’t we sit down? Why don’t we move forward with these appropriations bills? Why don’t we take care of the men and women who are serving? There are so many things we can do for them and for the country that we are not doing today. I urge my colleagues to sit down together, and let’s move forward because the American people deserve it, and our oath of office makes it incumbent on us to practice it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Kentucky. 
MOTION TO REFER WITH AMENDMENT NO . 816 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, in Washington, we have a disease—or a syndrome rather. I call it the dinosaur syndrome: big hearts, small brains. Un-fortunately, it is a recurring problem year after year, bill after bill, day after day. In Washington, it is argued that you are more compassionate if you give away more of someone else’s money. I would argue that true compassion is in giving your own money away. I would argue that truly rational policy is giv-ing away money that you have. It is one thing to give away other people’s money. It is another thing to give away money you do not even possess. As a country, we have a $20 trillion debt. We borrow $1 million every minute. Yet we are putting forward a bill to allocate $15 billion to those who are suffering from Harvey without pay-ing for it and without finding the money from anywhere. We are simply adding it to our tab—adding it to our $20 trillion bill. How did we get to $20 trillion in debt? Big hearts, small brains. Nobody has the courage to ask: Why don’t we pay for it? Why don’t we be legislators and stand up like men and women and say: Let’s set priorities. If it is a priority to help those in Texas—and I have great sympathy for those in Texas. My family is there. I have family members with 2 feet of water in their house so I have great sympathy for those who are in need, but there is no reason to be foolish. We shouldn’t just borrow the money. Why don’t we take the money from some-thing less important? My amendment, the America first amendment, would take the money from money we are going to send to foreign countries. We send billions and billions of dollars to countries that hate us. We send billions and billions of dollars to countries that burn our flag. I think it is a very simple choice, when we are looking at helping those in need in our country, that we quit sending money to other countries. What my amendment would do would be to pay for the $15 billion in aid by taking it out of the foreign aid ac-count. Who gets the money in the for-eign aid account? What is it spent on? I will give you a couple of examples of what we spend our foreign aid on. We spent billions of dollars—I think it is over $100 billion—on building roads in Afghanistan, blowing up roads in Afghanistan, building schools, blow-ing up schools, and then rebuilding all of them. Sometimes we blow them up, and sometimes someone else blows them up, but then we always go back and rebuild them. What about rebuild-ing our country? Why don’t we look at our country and rebuild our infrastruc-ture and rebuild our roads? For those who are flooded in Texas, let’s help them, but let’s help them by not send-ing the money to Pakistan and to other countries that do not even like us. In the foreign aid account, we spent $273 million last year teaching people how to apply for more of our money. So it is not bad enough that they take your money and send it to foreign countries that do not even like us, but we teach these people how to apply for more of our money. We had a televised cricket league that we spent $1 million on in Afghani-stan—a televised cricket league. The only problem is, they don’t really have any televisions. Why it is our obliga-tion? Why is the U.S. taxpayer asked to pay for a cricket league in Afghani-stan?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5034 September 7, 2017 
We spent $45 million on a natural gas, gas station in Afghanistan—$45 million. It was estimated to cost a half a million dollars—86 times cost over-runs. What does it serve up? Gasoline. Natural gas. Who has a car that runs on natural gas in Afghanistan? Nobody. So we bought them cars. We bought them cars that run on natural gas. Then they had no money with which to buy the natural gas so we gave them credit cards to buy the natural gas. That is where your money is going. If you want to help the people in Texas or those people who may be hurt in Flor-ida, why don’t we quit sending the money overseas? These are the people who chant ‘‘Death to America,’’ and we send more money to them. We spent money on home mortgages in Nigeria. We are spending money on home mortgages in Nigeria? We spent money on tourism in Albania. This is one of my favorites: We spent money teaching people in Kenya how to use Facebook. All I am asking is, Why don’t we stand up like men and women, like real legislators? If we are going to have compassion for those in Texas, why don’t we have the good wisdom not to just simply add it to our debt? In hysteria—everyone is hysterical—we must give, give, give someone else’s money but not only that. We must give, give, give money we do not have. We are going to destroy our country. There have been people who have ar-gued that our $20 trillion debt is the No. 1 threat to our national security. So what I am asking is, Why don’t we pay for this? Why don’t we simply take some money that we were going to spend somewhere else, for something not as valuable in another country, and spend it here? You realize what is going to happen. I will proffer this amendment, and in all likelihood, the swamp—the establishment—will vote this down because they never want to cut a dime of spending. They are al-ways compassionate. They have big hearts. They are willing to give away everybody else’s money, but they are never ever willing to pay for it. This is both parties—both the Republican Party and the Democrat Party. Watch the vote and see who is a conservative and who says we should pay for the aid for Harvey and who says, oh, no, that we should add it to the tab. Where is the $15 billion going to come from? This year, we are going to run a $500 billion debt. There is no money. They are giving away your grand-children’s money to help people. People will say that is compassion, that we are going to help people now. Yet we are stealing it from our kids’ futures, and we are stealing it from the future and the soundness of our country, and we are threatening the very security of our country with this enormous and elaborate debt. Simply pay for it. Simply say: Do you know what? This year, we cannot be so compassionate to people who are wanting to get healthcare in Cambodia. We have USAID money going to Cam-bodia to help them get cost-effective or lower cost insurance. We could not even do anything with the healthcare in our country. We failed to act on it, but we are sending money to Cambodia to help them with their healthcare. Why don’t we act here at home? Why don’t we take care of our own problems before we think we can take care of ev-erybody else’s problems everywhere around the world? So we will get a chance to vote today. My amendment will come up shortly, and it will simply say, yes, we are a big, rich country. We can help those in Texas, but we will pay for it by taking the money away from some-where else in the budget that is less of a priority. We give hundreds of mil-lions—really billions—of dollars to Pakistan. How much do they like us? Sometimes they help us, but some-times they harbor the enemy. Some-times they harbor whole networks of people who are plotting to kill us. What do they think of Christianity in Pakistan? Asia Bibi is a Christian. She has been in jail for 5 years—on death row—for being a Christian. What do they think of helping us with bin Laden? They did not raise a finger to help us with bin Laden. Bin Laden lived among them for years and years and years, and when we finally got bin Laden, we got bin Laden with informa-tion from a doctor named Shakil Afridi. What did Pakistan do to reward the doctor who helped us get bin Laden? Pakistan has him locked up for life in prison. Really, we need to requestion wheth-er this aid works at all to foreign coun-tries, whether it is counterproductive, and whether we have it in the first place, but we should also ask an impor-tant question: Maybe that aid ought to be better spent at home. Maybe we ought to start rebuilding our country instead of always thinking we have to rebuild everybody else’s country. I think this amendment is so easy to decide, and I think the American peo-ple are behind me on this amendment. If we were to take this to a huge vote of the entire American public, I think 75 to 80 percent of the American public would say: Do you know what? Let’s take care of our problems at home; let’s don’t send our money abroad. And I think we would win this battle. Watch this vote because in Wash-ington you will see the opposite. You will see three-fourths of this body or more say: Oh, no, we are not going to cut any spending to anyone. We could never cut foreign aid or welfare for for-eign countries. We are just going to add it on to the tab. I, for one, want to be a loud voice to say that it is risking our country’s future. It is risking the security of the United States to keep adding to a $20 trillion debt, no matter how good the cause is. Remember, the next time a politician tells you that they are so compas-sionate because they want to give away more of someone else’s money, ask them how much they gave of their own money if you want to judge their true compassion. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nebraska. Mr. SASSE. Madam President, Hurri-cane Harvey is a horrible tragedy. It has ruthlessly taken lives. It has taken diplomas and baby albums. It has taken homes and gardens and play-grounds. It has also given us many new pictures of volunteerism, heroism, and neighborliness, and God bless those many helping hands. It has also re-vealed the willingness, the advanced planning, and the hard work of many government employees in the State and local governments, in the National Guard, in FEMA, and beyond. So what are we doing here today in this body? And what should we be doing? What is the specific duty of the U.S. Congress at this moment? We should provide emergency funding re-lief. We should provide emergency funding for FEMA and for related agen-cies. They are doing important work, and they need it. The amount agreed upon by the ad-ministration and the House of Rep-resentatives on Tuesday—just 48 hours ago—was $7.8 billion. It passed noncon-troversially. The vote was 419 to 3. They did the right thing. So let’s ap-prove it. Let’s do the exact same thing. Let’s let FEMA spend that $7 billion. It is important money. There is a genuine emergency. There is real need. I am a small government guy, but there is a clear and urgent governmental role in this moment, so we should do it. But what we should not do are unre-lated things that we will pretend are hurricane relief. We should not fool ourselves into pretending that the leg-islation on the floor today is actually doing what it says it does just because it has a certain name on the top of the legislation. What we are actually con-sidering doing today in this body is much, much larger, much clunkier, and much less explicable or defensible to your and my constituents. Do your constituents know, for ex-ample, that far less than half of all of the spending in this bill before us today is in any way related to emer-gency relief for Hurricane Harvey? Think about that. Do your constitu-ents know that far less than half of the spending is actually related to hurri-canes? Shouldn’t they know that? Shouldn’t they know that the vast ma-jority of the money this body is going to spend today, under the pretend guise of an emergency in the Schumer- Pelosi-Trump bill, is not actually emergency spending at all? Do your constituents know that we are using the hurricane as an excuse to extend the debt ceiling? Translated, that means we can’t pay our credit card bill, so we are just going to take over the credit card company and change our credit limit without any discussion. We are not going to have any conversation about the fact that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5035 September 7, 2017 
we constantly spend more money than we have, and we have to borrow to do it. There is a mechanism by which, when we hit up against our debt limit, we are supposed to pause and have a conversation, but we are not going to do that today. We are going to use the hurricane as an excuse to hide from that truth. What we are really doing right now is borrowing from our kids. There is no other explanation for what we are doing. What we are doing is we are intergenerationally stealing. We are passing on debt to the next generation for current spending. We are not fund-ing infrastructure here. We are not funding roads and bridges and IT sys-tems and weapons systems. These are not things that could be called invest-ments in the future. Again, I am not talking about the hurricane spending. We should do all of the hurricane spending. But mostly what this bill is going to do is spend current priorities—current-year money—month over month, as we al-ways do, but we are going to pass the price tag and the debt on to our kids, and we are going to hide from our con-stituents what we are actually doing. We are not going to admit it. We are not going to have a conversation about it. We are not going to have an honest accounting about how much money we are going to spend. What we are going to do is increase the odds that we will have a debt crisis soon. At the moment that comes, we will have another emer-gency that we will be able to use as an excuse to do things that we then also will not want accountability for. We should separate these two things. We should do all of the hurricane spending. We should not do things that are not hurricane spending but, rather, are excuses to kick the can down the road on the nature of the obligations we are constantly incurring beyond our ability to pay. What we are not doing in this body today is draining the swamp. What we are doing is running a whole bunch of hoses to the edge of the swamp, turn-ing them on to the highest possible vol-ume flow, and then turning our backs on the swamp and shouting that there is nothing to see here. That is what we are doing. We are doing the opposite of draining the swamp today. Finally, do your constituents know that what we are doing today actually increases the likelihood of both a gov-ernment shutdown and a government default in December? The odds of a government shutdown are up and the odds of a government default are up in December. Do your constituents know that C
HUCK SCHUMER —whose title is minor-ity leader, not majority leader—just made himself the most powerful man in America for the month of December? C
HUCK SCHUMER has made himself the key man in all negotiations in Decem-ber because of the legislation we are going to pass today. Do your voters know that real and fundamental tax reform is going to get less likely because of today? What is going to happen today is that the calendar for the next 90 days will be laser-beam focused on that Decem-ber shutdown and showdown, and CHUCK SCHUMER and N ANCY PELOSI now hold most of the cards for when we get to December. This is an embarrassing moment for a Republican-controlled Congress and a Republican administra-tion. Here is the good news. We still have an off-ramp before us. We can do bet-ter, and we have a legislative pathway to do better. I have a motion at the table that is simple. It funds all of the emergency relief that the administration has re-quested for Hurricane Harvey. Hear that clearly. What the House did yes-terday morning that they negotiated Tuesday night funds all $7.8 billion that the administration says they need for hurricane relief. It passed 419 to 3. We can still pass that same legislation. That is it. That is what my legislation does. It doesn’t do anything that is not hurricane relief and pretend it is hurri-cane relief; it just goes back to the bill that funds all of the hurricane relief that the administration says they need. I am not offering lots of other stuff. I am not kicking the can down the road on the conversation that we should have tonight and tomorrow and Satur-day and Sunday about the debt crisis we face. All I am trying to do is make a bill that says it is about hurricane relief, actually be about hurricane re-lief instead of a majority of other stuff masquerading as hurricane relief. In short, if you want hurricane relief, this amendment is your vehicle to get to hurricane relief, not other pretend stuff calling itself hurricane relief. Just as the House did earlier this week in a 419-to-3 vote, we can do hurricane relief clear, plain, and simple, and we don’t have to hide a whole bunch of other stuff in it. Thank you, Madam President. I thank this body for its consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader.

Mr. President, I en-courage folks to take a close look at this picture of a forest ablaze in Or-egon. Right now, there are innumer-able fires burning across our State. Some of them are called complexes—a fire complex. Maybe it is referred to as a single fire complex, but that means there may be 10 or 20 different fires within that area. What we are seeing more and more with the changing climate, with cli-mate disruption, is that we have light-ning storms that sweep over our for-ests, will light up and create multiple fires at one time, and then, because the forest is so much drier, they burn fiercely. Just last week, Mary and I were hop-ing to spend a couple days out on the Pacific Crest Trail. This is the trail that runs from Mexico to Canada, and we were planning to go down to the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument and experience some of that, but we couldn’t because of the intense smoke from fires burning. Fires in the middle of the State had shut down some of the Pacific Crest Trail near Jefferson, so we decided to go up to the northern end of the trail, the trail that plunges into the Colum-bia River at a place called Bridge of the Gods, Cascade Locks, and walk south. The plan was to go about 18 miles or so and then pick up the Eagle Creek Trail and come right back through to where we had started. But posted at the start of the Pacific Crest Trail was that the Eagle Creek Trail had been closed and that the loop was shut down due to the Indian Springs fire. Well, we decided, OK, we can still at least do the first half and maybe con-tinue walking on through to Lolo Pass on Mount Hood and then get a ride and come back around to where we were. The point is that all across Oregon, there were either blazes or smoke from blazes. Oregon State is a plain, and it is not the only State. California, Washington, Montana, and parts of Idaho are burn-ing up, and it is getting worse each year. As we were considering how we were going to progress, we had to bypass a campground at Wahtum Lake because it was shut down. We had to camp on the side of a ridge that was just on the edge of the fire containment area. So we pitched our tent on a steep slope that had a little rock outcropping and a little bit of flat ground, basically about 3 feet by 6 feet. We settled down after a long day of hiking. We were ab-solutely exhausted. About 1 in the morning, I woke up and I got a strong whiff of smoke. So I leapt out of the tent, and down below us on the slope last week was this glow. Immediately I was concerned that fire had leapt into the valley below us, and you do not want to be on a steep slope upstream from a fire, especially when that is the direction the wind is blow-ing—as it was. I said to Mary: Wake up. Get out of the tent. We may have to make a run for it. And she jumped up. The glow just stayed the same, and it turned out it wasn’t a fire. It turned out that it was a landslide, and the Moon was illuminating that landslide and creating that glow on the slope below us. But we were terrified. You can imagine, if you are hiking through Oregon and suddenly there is a forest fire on the slope below you, you are going to run like crazy. Well, there were a bunch of folks who were on that Eagle Creek Trail that I referred to, and they were on a section very near the Columbia gorge—that section that hadn’t been shut down. They were walking south, but they couldn’t go on through the Tunnel Falls area. They could go only a few miles in. But a couple of teenagers went up that trail and started throwing firecrackers, fireworks off the edge of a cliff, and it set the gorge on fire on that Eagle Creek Trail. You can see how the Cascade Moun-tains plunge down to the Columbia River, and you can see here how that Eagle Creek Trail was lit up. There were 140 hikers trapped by this fire and the fire that Mary and I were dodging— the Indian Springs fire—and they had to retreat to the section of trail that actually goes through a tunnel that is drilled through the basalt. It has a wa-terfall next to it, and they were dropped supplies overnight before they could be brought out and escape this fire. This fire was raging so much, it had leapt the river—the Columbia River, the largest river by river flow volume in the United States of Amer-ica. It had leapt this river to the State of Washington. These are just two of the fires of the many that are burning across the State of Oregon. There is also the Chetco Bar fire, which is even larger than the Eagle Creek fire. The Chetco Bar fire has con-tinued and now has burned 176,000 acres of Douglas fir and oak and manzanita brush fields. There are 1,700 people working to contain this fire right now and, as of yesterday, it was just 5 per-cent contained. And, as of yesterday, the Eagle Creek Trail was just 5 per-cent contained. Fires are a big problem that is just getting bigger. There are 65 large fires burning across the United States; 19 of those are in Oregon. You can see how they are spaced out here. Both the In-dian Springs fire and the Eagle Creek fire that I referred to are here, and you can see its position and how it leapt across the Columbia River into Wash-ington State. There are more in Washington State and more in California and Idaho and Montana going this way. Nineteen of those 65 big fires are represented right here. Another 23 are in nearby Mon-tana. Over the last decade, we have seen an average of about 50,000 forest fires in America each year, with an average of about 5
1⁄2million acres being burned. This year, we are already over 8 mil-lion acres, with a lot more acreage that will be burned in the weeks ahead. In Oregon, we have seen an average of about 493,000 acres a year burn. We are over 550,000 acres now—and counting. So what happens during these intense fire years? What happens is we run out

of money to fight these fires, and then we engage something called fire bor-rowing. There is no FEMA for fires—no Federal Emergency Management Agen-cy for fires. So the Forest Service says: Well, we must fight these fires. I can tell you that a tremendous number of helicopters and planes and ground crews are involved in this effort. It is very expensive to fight them. We run out of money, and the Forest Service has to borrow from other ac-counts—from the hazardous fuels fund, which tries to reduce the amount of fuels that will create fires on the front end, so we decrease our effort on the front end in order to fight the fires on the back end. Forest management funds, forest res-toration funds, forest conservation funds, road maintenance funds, and funds that are designed to prepare for future timber sales—all of those are borrowed from. So I have been pushing, I have been fighting for us to get the funds now, right now, to make sure we don’t engage in fire borrowing to have to address this challenge, and we have a compromise that has been worked out that is going to help. In the con-tinuing resolution, the funds are based not on the amount the administration wanted but on the fiscal year 2017 level that included $400 million of buffer funds. One-quarter of what was author-ized in fiscal year 2017 is now going to be available—and available retro-actively—so that it can be used and spent in September, which is still in fiscal year 2017, so in immediate mo-ments we will not have to engage in fire borrowing. That is a victory. I thank the cochairs of the Appro-priations Committee for working so hard to help us get this provision that will stop the fire borrowing problem in the short term. But in the near future, after we are into fiscal year 2018—into October—we will be short funds that were spent for fiscal year 2017, so that will be a challenge we will have to con-tinue to address in the year to come. We are all thinking a lot about Har-vey and its impact on Houston and Texas, and we are all worried about Irma and the fact that it is hitting Puerto Rico, and it is aimed for Flor-ida. But let’s not forget the fires burn-ing all over the United States at an un-precedented rate, which we need to make sure we address as well. Under this provision I just men-tioned—this compromise that will be helpful in the short term—the Office of Management and Budget has control, and we need to make sure they actu-ally exercise that control and release those funds, so we will have to keep pushing. I see my colleague is here. I do want to talk a little bit about fisheries, but I will defer to him if my colleague from Vermont would like to speak. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 minutes. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strong-ly support the disaster relief package that is before us today. It is going to provide much needed assistance to the thousands of families and communities who were devastated by Hurricane Har-vey. As vice chairman of the Appro-priations Committee, I looked at it very carefully, and I know it provides a short-term increase to the debt limit to ensure the U.S. Government has ac-cess to the resources it needs. It funds the government with a continuing res-olution through December 8, enabling Congress to work to complete the fiscal year 2018 appropriations bills. It is a re-sponsible approach to addressing the needs of our Nation. As a Vermonter, as a human being, it was heart-wrenching to watch the dev-astation march through Texas as Hur-ricane Harvey made landfall, only to see it turn toward Louisiana. Now, Hurricane Irma has struck Puerto Rico and continues on its path toward Flor-ida and the east coast. Hurricanes Jose and Katia are swirling in the Atlantic. They are threatening our coast. This is a horrific time. My fellow Vermonters and I are all too familiar with these images. It was only 6 years ago that Tropical Storm Irene tore through our small, special Green Mountain State and left a wound we are still trying to heal today. A disaster of this magnitude demands the full support of the U.S. Govern-ment, and that includes all of us here. I am glad this disaster relief package is before us today. My Appropriations Committee staff has worked so hard on it. If we don’t act and act fast, FEMA exhausts its funds by the end of this week. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate stood by my side in 2011 and in the following years to help Vermont re-build after Irene, and I will stand in support of Texans and Louisianans now. And I will stand in support of Flo-ridians, if and when they need it. This is only a fraction of what we will need to help recover and rebuild after these storms. It is going to require years of Federal support, and we cannot let our commitment fade. We live in a world where 100-year storms seem to occur every year, so we have to invest in technology, conserva-tion, and infrastructure that will miti-gate further damage and make our communities more resilient in these crises. Our ability to respond doesn’t just depend on emergency assistance. Each year, in the annual appropriations bills, we fund programs that help us prevent and respond to severe weather events and invest in the necessary in-frastructure. The National Weather Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Sea Grant program, the Flood Map Modernization Program, Watershed Flood Prevention Operations, Regional Coastal Resilience Grants, Community Development Block Grants, and State and Local First Responder Grants— just to name a few—are all critical to these efforts. We cannot and should not accept the deep cuts that have been proposed by President Trump to these critical investment programs. Now, I thank Chairman C
OCHRAN for his leadership and cooperation to ad-vance these bills. It is through these bills we can fund important priorities. I have been asking since March to begin bipartisan budget negotiations to establish responsible topline funding levels for both defense and non-defense programs based on parity. The current budget caps do not allow us to produce 12 responsible bills. Absent a budget deal, deep cuts are mandated for both defense and non-defense programs. We have to move forward with urgency. So my heart goes out to all of those affected by Hurricane Harvey and Hur-ricane Irma. My vote goes out to help them, and I will continue to fight for them. This Senate amendment is really the first step and I support it. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, may I have 2 minutes to conclude my state-ment? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, so far this year, the Secretary of Commerce has declared nine disasters for fish-eries, and another disaster assistance request is pending in Southern Oregon and in Northern California. When these fisheries close, our fisher-men and their families are in deep trouble. Their expenses don’t dis-appear—the mortgages on their vessels, their mooring fees, their maintenance. Of course, they have to continue to be able to pay their basic living expenses. So when they are told they have to stay in port because a fishery is closed because of a fishing disaster, then, it is an enormous challenge to which we need to help to respond. It is not just for the fishermen themselves, but for the entire community—the rec-reational anglers, as well as the com-mercial fishermen, the processors, the gear stores, the boat repair facilities, and the tourism. All of it is impacted. So let us not forget that we have nine declared disasters for fisheries, and we should make sure we respond and assist these communities. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Vermont.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5039 September 7, 2017 
to the airport to get home to listen to Oregonians who have been clobbered by several megafires unlike anything we have seen in my home State of Oregon. On top of that, in addition to the megafires, there are numerous other fires. Just up the road from my hometown of Portland, the Eagle Creek fire has merged with the Indian Creek fire and spread over an area of more than 31,000 acres. What we have seen—again, just staggering in its implications—the fire jumped the Columbia River into Wash-ington State. It is ravaging our iconic Columbia River Gorge. This is a treas-ure beloved by the millions of people who visit every year and the people of my home State. Next to me is a shot of the fire which has been burning in the Columbia River Gorge now for days. Although it appears the first sparks of the Eagle Creek fire were ignited by a young man, it is clear the inferno was acceler-ated by the unusual heat in early Sep-tember. Now the lives and the homes of Gorge residents are under threat, and a world-renowned treasure in my home State has been devastated. Sadly, this wildfire devastation this month has rippled across Oregon. The Chetco Bar fire in Southwestern Or-egon has consumed more than 167,000 acres—an area bigger than all of Port-land. The Umpqua North fire east of Roseburg and the Milli fire in Central Oregon have torn through tens of thou-sands of acres each. I could go on. The point is, my home State is getting pounded by these fires, and the West is getting pounded by these fires. The skies glow orange at night as the flames burn on. Families wake up to ash on their windshields. Schools are closed, and people have been warned to stay indoors because it is not safe to breathe the hazardous air. On the Air Quality Index map from the Environmental Protection Agen-cy—which I have here—you can see the effects of the nightmare which has set-tled in over most of Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and large parts of Mon-tana. As I speak, there are a million and a half acres ablaze across Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Mon-tana, Colorado, Wyoming, Nevada, and Utah. One-third of these burning acres are in my home State alone. This year is virtually guaranteed to be the worst fire season in history in terms of the total area burnt. I served as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for a time, chaired the Forestry Sub-committee. I have sat in so many com-mittee hearings and heard again and again about the dangers these fires pose to our States. The fact is, the fires are getting hotter, they have gotten bigger, they have gotten tougher to fight, and this is a years-long pattern in the West. It gets hot. It gets dry. There have been inadequate efforts to go in there and thin out the dead and dying material. Then we have a light-ning strike in our part of the world, and then all of a sudden, we have an in-ferno on our hands. This time, as I indicated, it seems as if some of the problem was due to that set of firecrackers, but this is a years- long pattern in the West. Frankly, the same warming trends that have wors-ened the fires seem to have added fuel to storms that developed in the Gulf of Mexico and over the Atlantic. My seatmate, Senator N
ELSON , has been telling us about what his region is faced with. The victims of all these dis-asters and the communities that will continue to face these growing threats need the government to come up with smarter policies to try to prevent as much of this as possible. That is why I wanted to wrap up my remarks by way of talking about the bizarre way the Federal Government budgets for fight-ing fire. In the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have led a bipartisan ef-fort for years now. Senator M
IKE C
RAPO , the senior Senator from Idaho, and I had 260 groups—forestry groups, scientists, environmentalists—join us in the effort. What has happened over the years is the Federal Government has shorted prevention, and then, be-cause of the conditions being hot and dry and lightning strikes or what have you, we have a big fire, and then the Federal Government, to put the fire out, borrows from the prevention fund, and the problem gets worse. That is what we call fire-borrowing. The rea-son I call it bizarre is that the idea of ripping off prevention, which we need most, defies common sense. We have a dangerous, worsening cycle known as fire-borrowing. Shoddy budgeting today leads to bigger fires tomorrow, and it needs to stop. I remember not long ago—because this does so much damage to natural resources policy—the distinguished mi-nority leader of the Senate, Senator S
CHUMER , signed on to our bill. We all wondered, well, what is the situation in New York? It turned out they had a problem with a bug and a baseball bat, and the natural resource agencies had trouble dealing with that challenge be-cause so much of the funds had been frittered away with this broken system of fighting fire. That is why I have now called on the President to include a funding fix in any request for an upcoming disaster aid package. Several of my western colleagues and I—Senators from both sides of the aisle—are calling on Lead-ers M
CCONNELL and S CHUMER today to include a fix in any disaster aid pack-age that comes before this body. As I said, this battle has gone on for years. I think I mentioned to my friend from New Mexico that this issue with respect to fire-borrowing has been the longest running battle since the Trojan War. It has gone on and on and each year wastes more and more money on a broken system of funding the fight against wildfires. Senator C
RAPO has been an instru-mental partner in this effort. He also has a proposal that in effect builds on what we have been working on for years in the Banking Committee. I sup-port that proposal as well. I want it understood that there is a lot that has to be dealt with here in the Senate. There have been some horrible disasters—Houston and now the South, with what Senator NELSON is going to wrestle with this weekend. We have a lot to do. But when we are talking about western communities getting hit by a wrecking ball, which is exactly what these mega-fires do, I want it un-derstood that we western Senators, Democrats and Republicans, are going to be teaming up to make sure, as we said in our letter today to Leaders M
CCONNELL and S CHUMER , that a fire fix that is based on common sense, sen-sible practices to try to prevent fires to the greatest extent possible, has to be a focus of priority business in the Sen-ate. Too many western communities— the kind I am going to see this week-end—are faced with destroyed homes, businesses, lost recreation dollars, lost timber revenue, cleanup costs, and for-est and range land restoration efforts. The West cannot wait any longer for Congress to break this dangerous cycle that defies common sense, short-changes wildfire prevention, and does it year after year. What western Sen-ators are going to do is work together in a bipartisan way, which is what you have to do when your constituents are faced with these kinds of problems. I can tell you, in Oregon or Montana or Idaho, when you have one of these mega-fires, nobody is sitting around waiting to hear about just the Demo-cratic approach or the Republican ap-proach; they want to know what the Federal Government is going to do to help these hard-hit western commu-nities. It is absolutely essential that the Senate act soon. I have urged the President of the United States, who campaigned as a champion for these communities and the workers who live in them—I have said: Mr. President, do not ignore the West. Democratic and Republican Senators, given all the promises that have been made over the years, are going to insist that with fires of this magnitude—we have seen plenty of fires in the past, but we haven’t seen the kind of thing I have just described that isn’t very far from my hometown and across the State—given the urgency of the situa-tion, western Senators of both political parties are making it clear to Leaders M
CCONNELL and S CHUMER and the President of the United States that we need the Federal Government to act, and we need it to act now. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5040 September 7, 2017 
is great heart when he abandons pro-tections for our Nation’s Dreamers. It is an unfortunate pattern, and I hope it changes, facing historic low approval ratings, the President desperately ral-lies his dwindling supporters by ex-ploiting fear and resentment. Such conduct is shameful and unbecoming of the presidency, an office intended to represent our proudest ideals—not play to basest instincts. I have been here with every President since President Ford, both Republicans and Democrats. We agreed on some things and dis-agreed on some things, but the Presi-dents have always seemed to want to present and represent America’s proud-est ideals. We live in an unprecedented time when our President prefers to divide us, rather than unite us. Instead of honoring the sacrifice made by transgender individuals serving in our Armed Forces, President Trump de-cided to ban them from serving at all. When white supremacists violently ral-lied around hate in Charlottesville, re-sulting in the murder of Heather Heyer, the President equated those who promote bigotry with those who oppose it. There is no equation. The bigotry shown there and the hate shown there is wrong. This week the President targets an-other vulnerable population—Dream-ers. Dreamers are American by almost any definition. They came to the United States as children through no fault—and by no choice—of their own. Those of us who have had children or grandchildren know they don’t make those kinds of choices. They play by our country’s rules. They grow up. They have no criminal records, and seek only the chance to contribute to their communities and make them bet-ter. America is their home. Often, it is the only country they have ever known, just as my maternal grand-parents came from Italy and found a home in Vermont or my great grand-parents—paternal grandparents came from Ireland and found a home in Vermont. They wanted that to be their home. That was the American dream. When you threaten the Dreamers, you threaten the American dream itself. The President’s attempt to justify this decision as deference to Congress or respect for our courts is disingen-uous, at best. It strains reason that a President who signed 90 Executive ac-tions in his first 100 days suddenly cares about deference to the Legisla-tive Branch. It borders on laughable that a President who doggedly defends a Muslim ban found likely to be uncon-stitutional by multiple courts, is now cautious about the litigation risk of defending DACA in court. Dreamers are our friends and neigh-bors. They are students in our schools and universities in all our States. They serve our country in the military. They are among the first responders who come to save your life when there is a fire. Consider, for example, Jesus Contreras, a Dreamer and a paramedic, who saved American lives during Hur-ricane Harvey. If we had thrown him out, he wouldn’t have been there sav-ing those lives. The President’s deci-sion to end DACA is nothing but a cyn-ical ploy to rally the anti-immigrant voices within his base while attempt-ing to escape responsibility for deport-ing some of the most inspiring Ameri-cans in our country. On Tuesday, I received a letter from Dr. Juan Conde, a DACA recipient and resident of Vermont. Dr. Conde was brought to the United States by his mother as a child. In 2007, his mother lost her life battling cancer. This trag-edy inspired him to find a way to help cancer patients like her. Unable to pur-sue his dream of being an oncologist due to his immigration status, he ini-tially decided to pursue a Ph.D. in can-cer research. But Dr. Conde wanted to treat cancer patients, not just study the disease. After receiving DACA sta-tus, he was able to pursue his dream of directly helping patients, applying to and being accepted into the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medi-cine, where he is currently pursuing his medical degree. He hopes to spend his career here in the United States treat-ing cancer patients and researching the disease that has taken the lives of mil-lions of Americans, including members of my own family. Dr. Conde is the face of DACA. Dreamers have enormous potential and determination to contribute to the only country they have known since childhood. To deny them these oppor-tunities because they were brought here as children by their parents would be cruel and inhumane, motivated more by the toxic xenophobia of this administration than by any coherent policy goals. Stories like Dr. Conde’s reveal why President Trump’s decision to rescind DACA is as senseless as it is callous. Now the fate of DACA is in the hands of Congress. We can bring up a vote on this if the Republican leadership will allow that in the House and the Sen-ate. Some Republicans have spoken out against the President’s decision. It is easy to speak out. Act on it. Vote on it. We Democrats stand ready to protect our Nation of Dreamers. We stand ready to defend the American dream. I hope we are not standing alone. I would invite our Republican friends—stand up with us. Stand up with those Dreamers. I guarantee you, you have some living in your State. I guarantee you, just as my grandparents and my great-grand-parents did, they can make America a better country. Mr. President, I see other Senators on the floor. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the news this week that the President is terminating the Executive action protecting DACA re-cipients—Dreamers as we know them— but also putting the burden on the shoulders of this body, the article I branch, to find an appropriate solution. The President often said as a can-didate—and even in his early days as President—that he understood some things about these youngsters. He called them incredible kids, and he also said they would be fine. He did not use that language often in talking about immigrants so those were positive phrases that led many to hope he would continue the DACA Program. Many in his administration wanted him to. Others in this body—this speaker wanted him to continue the program, but he announced he was ter-minating it in 6 months and asked Con-gress to step up. I wanted to just tell you about a cou-ple of youngsters I was with last week. I had a roundtable on DACA at North-ern Virginia Community College, which is one of the largest and most di-verse community colleges in the United States. I held that this last week. I had eight students. They were a fascinating mixture of young men and women. I just wanted to come and share some things about their stories because it demonstrates how these young people, these Dreamers, are a source of strength for our country and that we need to accommodate them. Renata was one of my youngsters. She came to Virginia when she was 3 years old with her parents, her older brother, and sister. She graduated high school with an advanced diploma. Some of us know the International Baccalaureate diploma, which is rig-orous. Now, with DACA, she is study-ing at George Mason, getting a degree in clinical psychology. She does brain injury research. She wants to do that research to hopefully help people like returning veterans who suffer from brain injuries. Giancarla is a DACA recipient from Virginia. She came here a decade ago to be reunited with her parents. She hadn’t seen her parents in 7 years. She received DACA in 2012. She went to Radford University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in international ec-onomics. Giancarla described how she is so appreciative of where DACA has gotten her in life, but she told me the night before we met, she had a con-versation with her sister. Her sister was in high school and calling her big sister to describe how scared she was about what would happen if DACA was taken away. She talked about her little sister as a hard-working and studious kid, and she is worried she will not be able to go to college anymore and may be separated from family. Min is a young man who is a Korean- American born in Korea and a DACA recipient who is at George Mason studying cyber. He talked about his de-sire to serve the United States and help us with cyber expertise but how the re-moval of DACA could hurt his studies and could hurt his ability to get secu-rity clearances to be able to offer his talents to the country. Gloria, the fifth of these examples— there were eight students there—is an

interesting young lady from Nigeria. She was born in England to Nigerian parents and brought here as a young-ster. She will be the first DACA recipi-ent in Virginia to graduate from law school, William and Mary Law School. She wants to graduate in December and help new Americans with immigra-tion issues. We talked about all kinds of concerns they have: deportation of themselves or family members, ability to get a driver’s license, the ability to lawfully work and pay taxes—and all of these young people work and pay taxes right now—the ability to get instate tuition, which for many is the difference to being able to get a higher education. We talked about all of it, but we also talked about their love for this coun-try, and the fact that for these young students, this country is all they know. Deportation back to a place they don’t know is not really an option. I was also happy to have at this roundtable—because we talked about there is no such thing as a DACA re-cipient without a DACA ally—parents, teachers, family members, attorneys. They have a support group, and it is really important to acknowledge them too. We had officials from George Mason University, a public, com-prehensive university in Virginia; Northern Virginia Community College, one of our community colleges; Marymount College; Catholic Univer-sity in Northern Virginia—all of these allies, as well as representatives from other groups. The former publisher of the Wash-ington Post, Don Graham, came. He is funding, with others, a scholarship pro-gram to help Dreamers cover cost gaps if they have to pay out-of-State tui-tion, and this is working to help hun-dreds of Dreamers across the country. We talked to them and expressed our thanks to them for what they are doing. I also read stories this week—and I will say this and conclude—about other students. Juan is a 2017 graduate of Virginia Tech and now makes Blacksburg his home. He came to Vir-ginia at age 5 and he said this: 
It’s really hard for me to think of myself as anything but a Virginian and an Amer-ican. It’s really hard to have that part of my identity detached from me. 
That is how he views the reversal on DACA. Guadelupe from the Shenandoah Val-ley—one of Virginia’s very rural areas but has a significant number of DACA recipients. She started her freshman year at Bridgewater College, a small private college in the Valley. She says: 
This is the only country I’ve ever known . . . I’ve pledged my allegiance to the stars and stripes every day. 
This is the country to which these young people pledge their allegiance, owe their allegiance, want to express and act to demonstrate their alle-giance. They are doing it already. They are making us proud. We need to step up. It was my great pleasure in June 2013 to join with the Senators from New Mexico, from Vermont, and nearly 70 others on the floor to do a com-prehensive immigration reform that included many things but included a protection for these Dreamers. It was part of the education of a naive, young Senator who was in my first year to think: Great, we did something in the Senate. I am sure the House will do something, but 4 years later, not only did they not ever take up our bill even in committee, they didn’t even pass anything by way of comprehensive im-migration reform that we could put in a conference together. Now the weight of this is on our shoulders with 6 months. Talented stu-dents like these 800,000 nationwide, be-tween 12,000 and 13,000 in Virginia, have that fear, that anxiety: Are we going to be forced back into the shadows or, worse, are we or our family members possibly going to be deported? I will close and say these youngsters again pledge their allegiance to the United States, and they are dem-onstrating every day that we are richer as a nation because of them. Why would we not want to have these tal-ented young people pledge allegiance to us rather than elsewhere? America has always succeeded because we have been a great magnet for talent—grow-ing our own talent and celebrating it but willing to attract talent from around the world. The society that at-tracts talent in the 21st century is going to be the society that succeeds. The most precious resource in life right now is not oil. It is not water. It is tal-ent. These Dreamers have it, and we should want it. I hope my colleagues will work together in a bipartisan way, both Houses, to provide a protection. With that, I yield the floor and no-tice other colleagues here waiting to speak on the same topic. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Mexico. Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, thank you for your recognition. I am honored to come here today and follow Senator LEAHY and Senator K AINE and their speeches on DACA. I have also watched over the last couple of days, and I think almost every Democratic Sen-ator has been down to the floor to speak with passion about this issue. I am just so proud of our caucus and our Members who have stood up and called the President on this issue. Today, I stand with millions of Americans protesting the President’s heartless decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program known as DACA. This inhumane and cruel decision threatens the hopes and aspirations of our country’s young Dreamers, and there is no doubt it will harm the economy. I call on all Mem-bers of Congress—especially the Repub-lican leadership—to act now and to act swiftly to keep families together and allow these kids to realize their huge potential by making DACA the law of the land. That is what we need to do, make DACA the law of the land. If the President will not do the right thing, then Congress must take action and Congress must do this. Democrats, Republicans, and Inde-pendents across New Mexico and throughout our country agree that Dreamers deserve to live and work in the United States. According to a Morning Consult-Politico poll released this week, 76 percent support allowing them to stay—76 percent Democrats, Republicans, Independents. What a big number. Most Americans agree that our Na-tion benefits from the contribution im-migrants make in our communities and our economy. They believe our govern-ment should honor its promise to Dreamers. Many of these young people came here as small children and have not known any other country. Take Roxana. Roxana came to Santa Fe, NM, when she was 1 year old. She is now 22. She registered with DACA as soon as she could. She completed the paperwork, paid the fee, and she has complied with all of the requirements. She now works as a medical assistant with La Familia Medical Center in Santa Fe. La Familia is a great healthcare clinic. It provides excellent medical care to everyone in Santa Fe, including many immigrants and low- income patients. Roxana loves her work at La Familia, and she loves being able to help her fellow immigrants. Roxana had plans to go to nursing school, but the President’s action to end DACA jeopardizes those plans and puts them on hold. In Roxana’s words, ‘‘Santa Fe, NM, is my home. It’s where I know peo-ple. It’s where I’ve lived. It’s where I’ve gone to school. It’s where I’ve grown up. It’s my life. It’s something that is mine but doesn’t truly belong to me.’’ Those are her words. We must give Roxana and the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers what should truly belong to them. Dreamers more than pull their eco-nomic weight in our country; 97 per-cent are employed or are in school or do both. They work in Fortune 500 companies and public schools. They labor on farms and dairies. They create businesses, volunteer in our commu-nities, pay taxes, and pay into Social Security and Medicare. Why would we choose to kick some of our most tal-ented and most productive workers out of the country? Why kick some of our best and brightest young people out of this country? Ending DACA would cause chaos for employers. Forcing these motivated young people out of work could cost us 700,000 jobs—as many as 30,000 a month. That adds up to $460.3 billion in eco-nomic output over the next 10 years. Medicare and Social Security contribu-tions could drop by $24.6 billion over the same period of time. One of those young people who con-tributes in New Mexico is Brandon. Brandon came with his mother from Mexico to the United States when he

was 2 years old. Brandon goes to col-lege and studies every day to be an ar-chitect, and he makes straight A’s. He holds down a job to help support his family with medical bills and volun-teers in his community. Brandon is grateful for the DACA Program that has given him the opportunity to work and pay taxes. Yes, he is grateful to pay taxes. This President continues to divide our country like no other President we have known. Every day it is clear that his values are not in line with ours. I increasingly believe he is not fit to lead this great Nation. His campaign began with anti-immi-grant and racist rhetoric. He accused Mexican immigrants of being rapists and criminals, and his bigoted words have never stopped. He called for a wall along the entire border with Mexico—a wall that would cost billions of tax dol-lars and which border communities don’t want. He called for a ban on Mus-lim refugees—turning our backs on people who are fighting terrorism and who value the freedoms that we have here in the United States. He tacitly accepted the support of the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and bigots in Char-lottesville. He pardoned a law enforce-ment officer who terrorized the Latino community in Maricopa County, AZ, with unconstitutional raids and who forced detainees into inhumane living situations. Joe Arpaio is not a ‘‘good guy’’ as President Trump called him. Joe Arpaio is the criminal. This President doesn’t seem to value—let alone embody—the prin-ciples that America stands for, and now he wants to kick out of the coun-try young people who do value this country—like Carlos. Carlos was brought to New Mexico from Mexico when he was less than 1 year old. New Mexico is the only home he has known. Because of Carlos’s im-migration status, his opportunities were limited. He couldn’t play sports in school, couldn’t go on field trips, even though he pledged allegiance to the United States with his classmates. Carlos registered with DACA 2 years ago and, in his words, he was given wings. He is a full-time student at New Mexico State University, studying to be a mechanical engineer. He volun-teers as a firefighter. He works as a server at a local restaurant. He began a drive to help Hurricane Harvey vic-tims. Carlos says: 
We as DREAMers have proven ourselves to be worthy of being here in the United States. 
There are 800,000 young people like Roxana, Brandon, and Carlos hoping to do their part to make our country strong. By any measure, DACA has been a huge success. We already have the outlines of a program that works for America. We in Congress must roll up our sleeves and make this program the law of the land, and we must make sure that America truly does belong to Roxana and all of our Dreamers. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-mous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f 
RELIGIOUS TESTS Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have been doing a lot of thinking lately about the fascinating men and women of Amer-ica’s founding generation. I want to share with you one of their stories. Jonas Phillips was a penniless Jewish immigrant to America. He was an in-dentured servant, a hard-working busi-nessman, and an American patriot who served in the Philadelphia militia dur-ing the Revolutionary War. During the British occupation of New York City, he sneaked messages past the censors by writing notes in Yiddish, under-standing that his adversaries wouldn’t be able to understand or decipher it easily. Years later, Phillips addressed a let-ter to George Washington and to other delegates at the Constitutional Con-vention assembled in Philadelphia. He urged the delegates not to include a re-ligious test in the Constitution as any kind of requirement for service for the Federal Government because no man, he wrote, should be ‘‘deprived or abridged of any civil right, as a citizen, on account of his religious senti-ments.’’ Jonas Phillips wrote this letter for a reason. He wrote this because Pennsyl-vania, the State where he lived, re-quired officials to swear that the New Testament was inspired by God. As a faithful Jewish person, Jonas Phillips could not do that. ‘‘By the above law,’’ he wrote, ‘‘a Jew is deprived of holding any public office or place of government.’’ Thankfully, Jonas Phillips’ letter— Jonas Phillips’ prayer—ultimately would be answered. The Convention had voted unanimously to ban religious tests for Federal office. The language the Framers inserted into the Con-stitution was unequivocal upon this point. It said that ‘‘no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.’’ When the Founding Fathers wrote the word ‘‘ever,’’ they meant it. That word means something in the Constitu-tion, and we need to protect it. I feel the need to stress this point be-cause of the conduct of some of my col-leagues. Yesterday a Notre Dame law professor, Amy Coney Barrett, came before the Senate Judiciary Committee on which I serve. She had been nomi-nated as a prominent legal scholar and lawyer in this country to be nominated as a circuit judge. That is why she was before our committee. Her nomination has been endorsed by prominent legal scholars from across the political spectrum and across the country, including Neal Katyal, Presi-dent Obama’s Acting Solicitor General in the previous administration. Never-theless, at Ms. Barrett’s confirmation hearing, a number of my colleagues in-sinuated that her Catholic faith would somehow prevent her from applying the law freely and fairly. Here is an actual quote from that hearing: ‘‘Dogma and law are two dif-ferent things,’’ remarked one of my colleagues. ‘‘When you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is a concern.’’ Another one of my colleagues even went so far as to ask Professor Barrett to confess her faith under oath in the committee. ‘‘What is an orthodox Catholic?’’ this committee member asked. ‘‘Do you consider yourself an or-thodox Catholic?’’ If these remarks had been some sort of bizarre, one-time aberration, I prob-ably would have passed them over in si-lence. But I feel compelled to speak out because I wondered whether a pattern might be emerging—a pattern of hos-tility toward people of faith who come before this body. Just a few months ago, another emi-nently qualified nominee, Russell Vought, appeared before the Budget Committee to be considered for a post in the Office of Management and Budg-et. One of my Senate colleagues used his time to question this nominee, not about management or about budgets but about the nominee’s evangelical Christian beliefs. ‘‘In your judgment,’’ asked this Sen-ator, ‘‘do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be con-demned?’’ Mr. Vought explained to the committee that he is an evangelical Christian and that he adheres to the beliefs espoused by evangelical Chris-tians. That apparently wasn’t good enough for the questioner, who later stated that he would vote against Mr. Vought’s nomination because he was not ‘‘what this country is supposed to be about.’’ This is disturbing. This is not what the country is supposed to be about— some sort of inquiry into one’s reli-gious beliefs as a condition precedent for holding public office in the U.S. Government. These strange questions have nothing to do with the nominee’s competence, patriotism, or ability to serve among and for Americans of dif-ferent faiths equally. In fact, they have little to do with this life at all. In-stead, they have to do with the after-life—what comes after we die in this life. To my knowledge, the OMB and the Seventh Circuit have no jurisdic-tion over that. This country is divided enough. Mil-lions of Americans feel that Wash-ington, DC, and the dominant culture despises them, and how can they not when they see their leaders sitting here grilling patriotic citizens about their faith like inquisitors. How can they not feel that their values are not wel-come in this Chamber within this gov-ernment?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5043 September 7, 2017 
Religious freedom is of deep concern to me as a Mormon. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have weathered extraordinary religious persecution. Much of it, espe-cially initially, was sponsored by gov-ernment actors. The first Latter-day Saints were ex-iled from home to home. In 1838, the Governor of Missouri ordered that Mor-mons be driven from the land or ‘‘exterminated.’’ And yes, that is an ac-tual quote. Our first leader, Joseph Smith, once said: ‘‘The civil magistrate should pun-ish guilt but never suppress the free-dom of souls.’’ That, of course, was before he was martyred by a bigoted, angry mob. Our country’s ban on religious tests is a strong bulwark for religious free-dom. As an original provision of the Constitution, this ban against religious tests predates even the Bill of Rights, and it applies not to just some reli-gious adherents but to all of them equally. The religious tests raised against Mr. Vought and Professor Barrett do not favor one sect of Christianity over an-other as was sadly common for much of our Nation’s history. Rather, these par-ticular inquiries tend to favor the sec-ular, progressive creed clung to so con-fidently by many of our Nation’s ruling elites. This creed has its own clerics, its own dogmas, its own orthodoxy, and as these nominees have discovered, it has its own heresies as well. More and more, the adherents of this creed seek to use the power of govern-ment to steamroll favored groups, espe-cially dissenters, from their own per-sonal political dogmas. So they force evangelical caterers to bake cakes celebrating same-sex marriages, as is the case that is now before the Su-preme Court of the United States, and they force nuns to purchase contracep-tive coverage—nuns. They sue religious hospitals that will not perform abor-tions or sex reassignment surgeries for religious reasons. Yes, the secular pro-gressive creed has proved that it is ca-pable of triumphalism and intolerance, just as the creeds that have gone before it, not because its own adherents are uniquely wicked—to the contrary, be-cause they are human. There is a way out of this vicious cycle of religious intolerance, and it is a way that we have to find. That is for all of us to treat one another with ci-vility and respect while jealously de-fending the rights of conscience for ourselves, our neighbors, and all of our fellow citizens—for Christians, Jews, Muslims, atheists, agnostics, and ev-eryone else. This body can do its part by sup-porting legislation like the First Amendment Defense Act and the Mar-riage and Religious Freedom Act, which would protect the people who have conscious objections to recent cultural changes and make sure they are protected against one of the most brutal forms of discrimination that can be brought to bear; that is, the type of discrimination brought about by gov-ernments against individuals. At a minimum, this body can do its part by respecting the constitutional rights of citizens who come before it. Lest we forget, we work for them, not the other way around. I trust my col-leagues—Republicans, Democrats, and Independents—will take this to heart because religious freedom puts all Americans on the same footing. It helps men and women stand upright, honest before the law and before God. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

DACA Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the DACA Program, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which is very important in my State. We actu-ally have 6,000 kids who have gone through that program. As we all know, 800,000 young people who have lived in the United States since childhood are included and af-fected by this recent action by the ad-ministration, which I strongly oppose. These Dreamers were brought to the United States as children through no fault of their own and are working hard to educate themselves and contribute to our Nation. In fact, more than 97 percent of DACA recipients are now in school or in the workforce, and all DACA recipients are required to meet the program’s education requirements. One recent study found that 72 percent of all DACA recipients who are cur-rently in school are pursuing a bach-elor’s degree or higher. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges, more than 100 students with DACA status applied to medical school last year. The young people who have benefited from DACA have often been in our country almost their entire lives after having been brought here as children. They are valuable members of our com-munity, and they have contributed to our economy and to the fabric of our society. In fact, one recent study esti-mated that ending this policy would cost the country over $400 billion over the next 10 years. Ending DACA, which has been in place since 2012, would create tremen-dous uncertainty and risk deportation for nearly 800,000 Dreamers who are studying and working across our Na-tion. When I think of the Dreamers, I think of, first of all, the night that the Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis, passed comprehensive immigra-tion reform. There were Dreamers there. They were there late at night and had tears streaming down their faces. Then I think about the time that President Obama put DACA into place and made it so that they could come forward, sign up, and legally work. Now we are going to turn our backs on those same people, those people who were brought here through no fault of their own. Whether or not the current administration disagrees with the past administration, our country made a commitment to them that they could sign up for this program. Back when we passed comprehensive immigration re-form, I felt that our committee—the Senators who voted for that bill, both Democrats and Republicans—made a commitment to them that day that we were going to work on their behalf. That is why this is so wrong. I do appreciate that this morning the President said that he wants to work to pass this bill and that he said the DACA young people do not have to worry over the next 6 months about any actions taken against them. Those are, of course, good things. I just wish this had not happened in this way, but it did. I am also not surprised that so many people have stood up in support of Sen-ator D
URBIN and Senator G RAHAM ’s bill, that so many Republicans, Demo-crats, leaders in business, leaders in labor, and religious leaders have stood up. As we discuss the fate of these young people under DACA, I am reminded of someone who is not young—Joseph Me-dina, who is a decorated Army veteran and an immigrant who just celebrated his 103rd birthday this July. He is 103 years old. When I found him, he was a young 99 years old. The reason I found him was that we were talking about this very issue—about DACA and about kids, actually, today who want to serve in the military. As we know, through various ways, some of the DACA kids are courageously serving in our mili-tary right now. Of course, they will not be able to if they are deported, but just think that we are actually considering deporting people who are currently serving in our military. In any case, let’s go back 103 years ago or so—actually, maybe a little be-fore that. Joseph Medina came to the United States from Mexico when he was only 5 years old. He did not actu-ally know he was born outside of our country. He had been brought across the border as an orphan by his aunt and his stepfather, and he did not know that he had been born outside of the United States. He had lived his whole life in Sleepy Eye, MN, until he was in an Army boot camp in 1944. At that time, Joseph Medina wanted to serve our country, but he found out that he actually was undocumented. In his own words to me, he said: Well, back then, the Army really wanted us. The Air Force wanted us. The Navy wanted us. Everyone wanted us. So what did they do back then?

He said: We would go over to Canada under, actually, the guidance of our military for 1 night. He said he got to stay in a nice hotel. Then he came back, and he was a legal citizen. I have not looked into how they did this, but that is how they did it. That was, simply, back then. Then what did Joseph Medina do? He went and served our country. He served under General MacArthur in the Pa-cific. That is what he did. When he came back after bravely serving our country, he got married, and he had a boy. I met that guy. That guy served in the Vietnam war. So we have a dad who served our country in World War II, and we have a son who served our country in Viet-nam, all because at that time there were people who said: Do you know what? You were not brought over with any knowledge that you were even being brought over. You were only 5 years old. They did not deport him when he wanted to serve in our military; they made him a citizen. Joseph Medina came out here to Washington, DC, at the age of 99 to see the World War II Memorial for the first time. I stood there with him as he looked proudly as that memorial, along with two Dreamers, who were high school students, who actually wanted to sign up and serve in the Air Force, but they were barred from doing that under the way our laws worked at the time. I am proud of Joe’s service, but I even want more. Joe’s spirit and his de-votion to our country can continue on and be passed on to other generations. That is what this Dream Act is really all about. It is about other kids who were brought into this country without their knowledge and without their even understanding what was happening and allowing them to be part of that Amer-ican dream. America is a country created by im-migrants. Immigrants have been part of our Nation’s greatest achievements. We need to fix our broken immigration system. Of course we do. That is why I supported comprehensive reform so that we would have had money for order at the border, which would have created a very, very long glidepath to citizenship, but there also was a moral compass to that bill. It has been 4 years since we passed that bill, and as we all know, despite the bipartisan support in the Senate, the House failed to act. By the way, despite reform being good for our economy, I always like to point out to people that of the Fortune 500 companies, 70 of them in America are headed up by immigrants. Of our U.S. Nobel laureates, 25 percent of them were born in other countries. We literally cut off talent when we cut off immigration. In my own case, my great-grand-parents on my dad’s side came over from Slovenia to work in the iron ore mines. When he was in about the sixth grade, my grandpa had to quit school to go work to help raise his eight or nine brothers and sisters, but he al-ways had this immigrant spirit. He never even graduated from high school, but he saved money in a coffee can so he could send my dad to college. On my other side, my mother’s par-ents—my grandparents—came over from Switzerland. My grandma came over when she was very young—I think at 3 years old. My grandpa came over when he was about 18. He was detained at Ellis Island because they had reached their quota of Swiss immi-grants, so he put on his form that he was going to Canada. He did go to Can-ada, but he did not stay in Canada. He somehow got through to Wisconsin and was there as an undocumented alien, and he lived that way for 20 years. He married my grandma, had my mom and her brother. When World War II came along, they required those aliens to register, so he had to register. That is when they found out how he had come in, and they still said that it was OK, that he could register. Then he was kind of emboldened, so he decided to sign up for citizenship. That was when they really looked into it, so he had to have a hearing. He made his case that he had lived here forever and had been there, had had two kids, worked his en-tire time at a pie shop, and they gave him citizenship. I still have that pic-ture of his shining face with that bow tie. I wonder what would happen to him today if he were to come forward. I am not sure he would be made a cit-izen despite the long time he had spent in our country. Now it has happened on both sides of my immigrant family. My dad ended up being a newspaper-man and got to interview everyone from Ginger Rogers, to Ronald Reagan, to Mike Ditka. My mom became a teacher and taught second grade until she was 70 years old. And I stand before you as the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the State of Min-nesota. That is the immigrant story. That is a story of a family who came in, not in an easy way, with my grandpa in an uncertain status, clearly, when he came into the United States. So you ask me why I support these Dreamers? Because I had Dreamers in my own family. I am pleased that so many of my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle have spoken out in support of DACA, and it is essential that we now pass this legis-lation to protect these Dreamers. I stand ready to work with my Repub-lican colleagues. I thank Senator D
UR-
BINand Senator G RAHAM for their lead-ership. Let’s get this done. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

THE NATIONAL DEBT Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, we have had a lot of action today in the Senate, which is unusual here, and I wish to ad-dress it. I would like to address this to the people in Texas, Louisiana, and to all of those who just experienced the dev-astating results and the impact of Hur-ricane Harvey. Obviously, our hearts go out to those people, and, of course, we are going to do the right thing and help the people of Texas, which is just what we voted on today. But there is a bigger issue I want to speak to today. I relate to this personally because, just last year—almost exactly to the day— our family was evacuated from our home in South Georgia. As I speak today, we were just notified today that my wife and mother-in-law, who are there today, will be evacuating this weekend from the south coast of Geor-gia, trying to get out of the way of the next hurricane—Hurricane Irma— which looks to be a very dangerous storm as well, coming into Florida over the next day or so. But this crisis that we just saw in Texas and that we might see in Flor-ida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina with the next hurri-cane—Hurricane Irma—reminds us of a bigger issue. It reminds us that because of our inability to get our financial house in order and as a result of the debt crisis we have today, we are losing the right to do the right thing. Wheth-er it is medical research, whether it is infrastructure, or whether it is edu-cation, whether it is funding our mili-tary, which we will deal with next week, we are losing the right to do the right thing. By that I mean our own fi-nancial intransigence over the last 16 years, primarily, but, I would say, ever since 1965, when we had the Great Soci-ety and the great War on Poverty, which has failed miserably. That was another great, sweeping, progressive, liberal program that failed to make any dent in our poverty rate in the United States. The poverty rate today is fundamentally the same as it was in the days when that bill was signed into law. Because of our intransigence, our ability to appropriate money to deal with disasters like Hurricane Harvey and potentially Hurricane Irma and others is in danger. Moving forward, we just simply will not be able to continue to deal with these emergencies and cri-ses if we don’t have a functioning Fed-eral Government that actually pays its bills and has its financial house in order. The national debt is actually what pulled me into the political process. It is the reason I am in the Senate today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5045 September 7, 2017 
The people of Georgia understand that this is an underlying crisis that we have been digging here for the last two decades and it simply has to be dealt with. Today we have $20 trillion in debt. I call that a crisis because we do not have a plan to reduce that back to some reasonable percentage of our GDP. This is greater in size than the size of our entire economy. What is worse than that and what is more con-cerning is that over the next 30 years, we have over $130 trillion, by most esti-mates, of future unfunded liabilities coming at us like a freight train. That is Social Security, Medicare, pension benefits for Federal employees, and the interest on the debt, primarily. Here we are dealing with this debt ceiling just today, and I would argue that the debt ceiling has been the most ineffective thing that I have seen in the Senate. Over 100 times it has been extended or increased, and it has not slowed down deficit spending in the Congress. It has not kept us from hav-ing a $20 trillion debt today. Washington knew this was coming, by the way. We have raised or sus-pended this debt over 100 times to no avail. It hasn’t slowed down the debt spending that we have been doing, par-ticularly over the last two decades. Two months ago in June, a group of Senators and I listed the debt ceiling as one of the key reasons why we thought we ought to stay here during the month of August, instead of going home and having our work period there, because we felt that this needed to be debated and that we needed to get to a long-term solution. Exactly 3 months ago today, I stood right here in the Senate and laid out what I thought the real consequences of the debt would be. At that time I said: 
Congress is the only enterprise I can find anywhere in the world that funds its oper-ations the way we fund this government. The problem is we have a system that is abso-lutely, totally broken. It is a fraud that is being perpetrated on the American people. 
I stand by that today. The American people know that this is a fraud per-petrated on them, and that is why I think we have seen change in leader-ship in the White House. Just three months later, we see our debt limit today being dealt with in a way that puts in jeopardy our ability to deal with these national disasters, such as hurricanes and fires. We heard just a few minutes ago about the devastating fires in the Northwest. Let’s be clear. The United States cannot and will not default on our debts. It will not default on our obliga-tions, but this debt ceiling issue should have already been resolved months be-fore now. We actually hit this debt ceiling—just so everybody remem-bers—in March of this year. The Sec-retary of the Treasury has been using unusual measures—extraordinary measures, they call them—to keep the government funded during this period of uncertainty. In fact, we hit this debt ceiling at a time when we should have been dealing with the budget. But still today—as I stand here today—we do not have a budget for fiscal year 2018, and we have 15 days until the end of this fiscal year, or the end of Sep-tember of this year—September 30. Raising the debt ceiling now just until December 15 isn’t what puts our country at risk. The debt ceiling is not the issue here. It is not the problem. It is the unbridled spending that both parties have succumbed to over the last two decades under two Presi-dents—one Republican and one Demo-crat. Our government has grown from $2.4 trillion to $3.9 trillion. That is con-stant dollars. Neither party can point fingers at the other in terms of the ex-plosion and the size of the Federal Gov-ernment. What is worse, as I just said, is that over the next 30 years, our mandatory expenses—it is not our discretionary spending. Discretionary spending in the last 9 years has come down, largely because of the Budget Control Act and because of sequestration. Our discre-tionary spending has come down from about $1.5 trillion to just over $1 tril-lion last year. That $400 billion reduc-tion, though, came on the back, pri-marily and largely, of our military. The debt ceiling has to be dealt with, but it is not the driver of our problems. The budget process is the underlying release valve that causes this problem, and it allows both parties, particularly in the last 20 years, to spend money we don’t have. The budget process, as I have said be-fore on this floor, has only worked four times in 43 years. We have to appro-priate 12 bills a year to fund the Fed-eral Government. The average over that 43-year period is only 21⁄2. That is the fraud that is being perpetrated on the American people. No other body— no other entity that I can find any-where in the world—can get away with that. Yet here we are, kicking the can down the road again for another 3 months. Fixing the budget process alone will not solve the debt crisis, but we will not solve the debt crisis unless and until we fix this broken budget process. We cannot ignore this any longer. We must stop piling up this debt on the backs of our kids and our grandkids. The fix is readily available. This debt crisis is not something we can’t solve. People say: Well, you can’t touch So-cial Security and you can’t touch Medicare. Wait a minute. If we don’t touch them, they are going to be broke in 14 short years. In 14 years, the trust funds of both Social Security and Medicare go to zero—zero. People will not be up here changing Members of this body at the rate they are now. It will be much accelerated. The fix can be done. There are five areas that need attention, and any of these areas can have bipartisan solu-tions. I will not go into detail today. I will just highlight the five areas, but we have to deal with each one of these on their own merits. The budget proc-ess is broken and can be fixed. I believe we have right now, behind the scenes, Democrats and Republicans working together to find a bipartisan, politi-cally neutral platform to present our arguments on both sides of the budget process and to create a budget that ac-tually funds the Federal Government appropriately, without all of this drama and without a release valve of extra spending. The second thing is redundant spend-ing. We know that the GAO, or the General Accountability Office, and the Congressional Budget Office both agree that we have several hundred billion dollars in redundant agencies and re-dundant programs. The third is to grow the economy. This is job one by this President. This President has said that job one of this administration this year is to do the things necessary with the regulatory environment and the tax environment to grow the economy. The fourth area is to save Social Se-curity—not to cut it but to save Social Security and save Medicare. That can be done, and I believe there are bipar-tisan alternatives that we should be de-bating right now. In 21⁄2years, that has not come before this body, and I don’t see it happening in the balance of this year. The fifth area is that, while we de-bated healthcare most of this year, we debated the insurance side of healthcare for the individual market and Medicaid but what we never talked about—and we haven’t under President Obama, President Bush, and, now, even under President Trump—in this Con-gress is that we have not dealt with the spiraling drivers of healthcare costs themselves—healthcare delivery, phar-maceuticals, and the fact that the neediest among us are getting the most expensive care in emergency rooms today unnecessarily. Don’t be misled. We are well into this debt crisis. This is not something that can be solved with a 10-year planning horizon. This is a situation where we need to tell the bond market and the world that we are committed to a 20- year or 30-year period in order to fix this debt crisis. Ideas are coming from both sides of the aisle. One idea comes from the Democratic side that says: Let’s pick a time in the future, put a stake in the ground about what target percentage of GDP our debt should be, and then de-velop a roadmap between today and that point in time in the future to commit ourselves to get there. I ap-plaud that idea. I think that is a genu-inely brilliant idea. It is something that other countries have done before and it is something that works. I hope my colleagues will please re-member that, today, every dollar we spend in our country’s defense, which is about $600 billion directionally cor-rect in our military and between $150 billion and $200 billion for our veterans,

and all domestic discretionary spend-ing, or about $1.1 trillion—every dime of that—is borrowed money. Let me say that again. Every dollar we are spending on our defense, every dollar we spend on our veterans, and every dollar we spend on our discretionary domestic programs, like what we are doing here today, is borrowed money. This simply cannot continue. I can’t think of any taller order. Between now and the end of the year, as we debate the tax changes that we want to make to our Tax Code so that we can become competitive with the rest of the world, let’s remember why we are debating that tax issue. We are debating the tax issue to be-come competitive with the rest of the world, to grow the economy. That is one of five areas which need to be dealt with. Our regulatory work is the other area in that attempt to grow the econ-omy. But we will not dig out of this debt crisis unless and until we fix our budget process, stop this redundant spending, save Social Security and Medicare, and fix the spiraling nature of our healthcare costs. I can think of nothing—nothing—in our future the rest of this year that is more important than addressing this budget process as we look at tax and dealing with this long-term debt crisis that we have. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

STOP ENABLING SEX TRAFFICKERS ACT Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, it is a tragedy that in the Presiding Officer’s home State of Louisiana, in my State of Ohio, and around this country, girls and women, children and adults, are being trafficked online. Sex trafficking is really a stain on our country. We have taken some actions in the U.S. Senate to deal with this. We passed four or five bills to increase prosecution of those who engage in this, to ensure that women who are victims are treated as such and not as criminals. We have talked about how to help find missing children. I have been involved in those efforts. We have a caucus here on trafficking which has gotten involved in these issues. Here is the reality, as I see it. Unbe-lievably, in the 21st century, this prac-tice of selling people is increasing, and it is increasing primarily because it has moved online, where it is, trag-ically, efficient. We have learned, through an exten-sive investigation over the last couple of years, that there is one website on-line which handles most of the com-mercial sex business and most of the trafficking, and that is a website called backpage.com. What we have done in the U.S. Sen-ate by focusing on this issue is we tried to determine how do you turn the tide, begin to get to the point where, instead of hearing more and more stories about women and girls and sometimes boys being trafficked online, in fact, we are beginning to get to a situation where we can find ways to get those people into treatment and recovery, deal with their trauma, and begin to stop this horrendous practice. It is really taking away the God-given potential of those engaged in it. There is nothing more horrible than meeting a young girl who has been trafficked and hearing the horrendous stories. I was recently back in Ohio and had the opportunity to visit with some vic-tims. I remember one young woman in particular told me she was trafficked at age 9—starting at age 9—by her fa-ther. He would take her to Super Bowls out of town, and he would traffic her online in their hometown. Imagine the trauma and the heartbreak. Typically, now it is connected also with heroin or fentanyl or prescription drugs or other opioids. In other words, these girls or women are often made dependent, in part, from their addic-tion, and the traffickers cruelly use that addiction to force them to do things they would never otherwise en-vision. So we know that. We know this is happening. We know it is increasing. We know it is online. What do we do about it? Unfortunately, as we have learned in our investigation, these websites on-line that engage in this are largely pro-tected. They are immune from prosecu-tion. They are immune from victims being able to get justice. They are de-nied justice because of a Federal law which protects these evil people who knowingly are engaged directly in sex trafficking. That is pretty amazing; isn’t it? But that is what is happening. Victims were denied justice just 2 weeks ago, when a judge in Sac-ramento, CA, dismissed pending charges against backpage.com—this group I talked about—because of what they cited, which is a broad immunity granted by a 1996 law called the Com-munications Decency Act. As the court saw it—and other courts have seen it—this law gives third-party website providers or publishers immu-nity from these kinds of heinous crimes, even if the website is partici-pating in sex trafficking. The court opinion made it clear, it is up to Congress to remedy this injus-tice, suggesting: ‘‘If and until Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law, the broad reach of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act even ap-plies to those alleged to support the ex-ploitation of others by human traf-ficking.’’ In other words, what the courts have said is, Congress, this is up to you. You passed legislation—I believe inadvert-ently—inadvertently—which provides this immunity and protection for these people who continue to engage and par-ticipate in—knowingly participate in trafficking, including of underaged girls. This is just the most recent ruling in a string of judicial decisions that have defended backpage and the other sites from legal challenges, despite their clear involvement in this criminal ac-tivity. In 2016, last year, the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of backpage in a case brought by three girls who were sold for sex on the site, but the court opinion noted that in order to fix the problem, ‘‘the remedy is through legislation, not litigation.’’ They called the practice what it is, im-moral, but then they said the solution is not more litigation, it is legislation; in other words, Congress, get your act together—get your act together. These court rulings underscore the need for us to get our act together and to do so with urgency because every day that goes by, more girls, more women are trafficked online, and this must stop. Having met with dozens of sex traf-ficking victims, I asked them the ques-tion, of course: How did it get to this point? Were you trafficked by some-one? How did you find yourself here? Most of these victims—most of these victims—tell me the same story, which is backpage.com. Their trafficker has them, as they say, off the street corner onto the smart phone—and, again, tragically efficient, in the sense that they may be sold 10, 15, in one case, 20 times during a single evening. They de-serve to know we will not passively let this injustice continue. They deserve to know Congress will step up and cor-rect this Federal legislation which we passed in Congress 20-some years ago to deal with this issue. In August, I visited the Oasis House in Dayton, OH. Oasis is a wonderful place. They welcome up to 11 women at a time to live in a faith-based commu-nity which provides them incredible support. It helps deal with the trauma we talked about earlier, helps them to be moving from that trauma to inde-pendence. They are getting recovery and support there. So many of these women have had a transformation, and it is wonderful to see them back with their families or back at work. Speaking with these victims, backpage came up—as it often does. It is just heartbreaking to hear what they had to say—but mostly they can’t get justice; that the website that facili-tated these crimes against them is off limits. That is why, in July, after an 18- month investigation into online traf-ficking, I introduced—along with a number of my colleagues—legislation called Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. Currently, we have 27 cosponsors in the Senate. We have only had this introduced while we have been in ses-sion for 2 weeks because we introduced

it just before the August recess, but Senator R
ICHARD BLUMENTHAL , Senator J
OHN MCCAIN, Senator C LAIRE MCCAS-
KILL, Senator J OHN CORNYN , Senator H
EIDI HEITKAMP , and more than 20 other Senators have joined in this ef-fort to deal with the real problem, which is the growth of trafficking due to the online presence and specifically some of these websites like backpage. The bill would make three narrowly crafted changes to what is called the Communications Decency Act to allow backpage and other websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking to be brought to justice. First, it allows victims of sex traf-ficking to seek justice against websites. It does so by removing the law’s unintended protection we talked about for online sex traffickers. Sec-ond, it helps law enforcement by allow-ing the prosecution of websites, again, that knowingly assist, support, or fa-cilitate a violation of already existing Federal sex trafficking laws. There is already a law in place that makes it il-legal to engage in sex trafficking. The exception is, again, these websites on-line that are protected by the Commu-nications Decency Act. So it basically says that you will be treated like oth-ers if you engage in, facilitate, and sup-port it. Finally, it lets State law enforce-ment—not just the Department of Jus-tice—take legal action against these websites that violate Federal sex traf-ficking laws. The Communications Decency Act, again, was enacted by Congress a cou-ple decades ago—21 years ago—and now it needs to be brought into the 21st century. Again, it is an important piece of legislation, broadly speaking, but on this particular issue—inadvert-ently, I believe—it has allowed this in-credible injustice to continue. In my view, victims shouldn’t have to wait one more day to get the justice they deserve. State and local prosecu-tors, those on the frontlines, should be able to prosecute backpage and others for their roles in these crimes. The leading website for online sex trafficking has and will continue to es-cape legal justice for its active role in trafficking unless Congress acts. The solution is right in front of us. This bi-partisan legislation will make the changes necessary. By the way, these are changes that a number of groups on the outside have called for and have strongly supported. On August 15, I was proud to an-nounce the support of 16 new Ohio or-ganizations and officials who endorsed the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. The list includes anti-human traf-ficking advocates, human rights groups, State officials, and Ohio sex trafficking victims, among others. This is in addition to the list of dozens of national anti-human trafficking and law enforcement groups who have come out publicly in support of this bill. I appreciate them. I appreciate what the human trafficking advocacy groups do every day, trying to help these victims. I really appreciate our law enforce-ment officials, and the fact that orga-nizations like the Fraternal Order of Police step forward to support this leg-islation is very important. On August 16, the day after we had this endorsement from all these groups from Ohio, 50 attorneys general from across the United States—50, including Ohio’s Mike DeWine—sent a letter to Congress asking for the Communica-tions Decency Act to be changed to allow State and local authorities to hold backpage and other websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking ac-countable. The letter stated, in part: ‘‘It is both ironic and tragic that the CDA, which was intended to protect children from indecent material on the internet, is now used as a shield by those who prof-it from prostitution and crimes against children.’’ They are right. Initially the Commu-nications Decency Act was put in place to try to shield young people from por-nography. What these attorneys general are calling for and what this Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act will do is allow us to go after these websites. This bill will allow victims to get justice, as I said, and will do so in a way that protects internet companies that are doing the right thing. Notably, we preserve the Communications Decency Act’s Good Samaritan provision, which protects those good actors who proactively block and screen for offensive material, shielding them from any possibility of frivolous lawsuits. That is important. The good actors out there—and the vast majority of websites are good ac-tors—have nothing to do with sex traf-ficking. In fact, many of them police their site for it. The Facebooks of the world and the Googles of the world are not the bad actors. We are gaining momentum within the tech community, some of whom have concerns about changing the Communications Decency Act. Just this week, we got a letter from Oracle, strongly supporting the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. They agreed that this narrowly crafted bill will hold the bad actors accountable while pro-tecting well-intentioned websites. Oracle’s letter says, in part: 
Your legislation does not, as suggested by the bill’s opponents, usher the end of the Internet. If enacted, it will establish some measure of accountability for those that cynically sell advertising but are unprepared to help curtail sex trafficking. 
Other tech companies have also joined in the fight to ensure that we can stop sex trafficking. I know they are going to follow Oracle’s lead in publicly supporting this legislation. Courts across the country, again, have made it clear that their hands are tied. Their hands are tied in bringing backpage and other websites to justice. It is our responsibility right here in the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress to change this law. Women and chil-dren have had their most basic rights stripped from them and have been let down by our judicial system and, frankly, up to now, by Congress in their search for justice. With these latest calls to action from judicial rulings and this recent letter from 50 attorneys general, any future injustice in the legal system because of the Communications Decency Act falls on Congress. It falls on the shoulders of those in the U.S. Senate and the House. It is not just the attorneys general around the country who have supported this; the district attorneys have sent a letter this week supporting it—again, other law enforcement across the board. Through this legislation, we have the opportunity to right this wrong, to make a real difference in the lives of vulnerable women and children who have been victims of trafficking. Justice cannot be seen, but its ab-sence can be felt. Those who have been trafficked by backpage, only to see the company prosper and escape legal con-sequences, have experienced unimagi-nable injustice. They feel it. The path to action is clear. Victims need this legislation that the courts, attorneys general, district attorneys, victims, and others have been calling for. Congress must pass the Stop Ena-bling Sex Traffickers Act in order to correct this injustice. I yield back my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DIASTER RELIEF FUNDING BILL ∑Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I am home in West Miami, FL, which is now under a Hurricane Watch for Hur-ricane Irma and currently projected to take a direct hit from a category 5 storm. Tropical storm conditions are expected in south Florida less than 48 hours after the time of this vote. Had I remained in Washington, DC, the ear-liest possible return to south Florida would have given me less than 12 hours to safely secure my home and my mother’s home and otherwise prepare my family to face the brunt and the aftermath of a potentially catastrophic storm. Therefore, given these cir-cumstances and the fact that my vote would not have been determinative of the outcome of the measures before the Senate, I felt the prudent course of ac-tion was to remain in south Florida, take appropriate actions to protect my family and helping to coordinate ef-forts between Federal, State, and local officials. If I had been able to participate in to-day’s Senate vote in Washington, I would have voted to approve the sup-plemental package before the Senate, but my vote would come despite sig-nificant reservations about some of the other items attached to this legisla-tion. As I have always done in the past, I support providing additional emer-gency resources for disaster aid and re-covery. Disaster relief is an appro-priate function of the Federal Govern-ment. Unlike some previous disaster relief legislation, these funds are to be spent immediately, and are properly targeted to assist the areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey and potentially Hurricane Irma. The rest of this spending package, however, contains items that, under normal circumstances and offered sepa-rately, I have opposed. I strongly disagree with the decision made by the administration to agree to pair funding for FEMA and emergency disaster relief to short-term extensions to the continuing resolution, the debt ceiling and the National Flood Insur-ance Program unaccompanied by sig-nificant reforms. During my service in the Senate, my support for increasing the debt limit has consistently in the past and will again in the future be conditioned on meaningful spending reforms that ad-dress our long-term debt. Absent extenuating circumstances such as the outbreak of the Zika virus last year, I have consistently opposed passage of short-term continuing reso-lutions because it is an incredibly inef-ficient way of spending taxpayer dol-lars and fails to provide the certainty required for effective planning. I am frustrated that Congress has once again temporarily reauthorized the outdated National Flood Insurance Program without enacting a long-term solution that makes much-needed im-provements for the people of Florida and places this vital program on a sus-tainable path. It is shameful these necessary and important measures are not being con-sidered separately. Linking them to funds needed to assist our fellow Amer-icans recovering from a devastating natural disaster is a cynical effort to avoid subjecting these measures to the scrutiny and debate they merit. Today I was informed by its director that FEMA has less than 2 days of emergency funds remaining. Given that Texas continues to recover from the catastrophic effects of Hurricane Har-vey and that the State of Florida is facing the most powerful Atlantic storm ever recorded, I have no choice but to support this measures, but I con-sider the manner in which this measure was structured, linking emergency dis-aster relief for victims which requires immediate action with other con-troversial measures we still have time to debate through the regular order, to be among the most politically cynical efforts I have ever witnessed. ∑ f 
BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for September 2017. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, S. Con. Res. 3. This information is nec-essary for the Senate Budget Com-mittee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending leg-islation. The Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Con-gressional Budget Office, CBO, pre-pared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. My last filing can be found in the R
ECORD on July 12, 2017. The informa-tion contained in this report captures legislative activity since that filing through September 5, 2017. Republican Budget Committee staff prepared tables 1–3 of this report. Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee ex-ceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the most recently adopted budget resolu-tion. This information is used for en-forcing committee allocations pursu-ant to section 302 of the CBA. For this reporting period, 11 of the 16 author-izing committees are in compliance with their allocations, two fewer than my last report. Legislative activity during this reporting period brought both the Committee on the Judiciary, for a State compact relating to the Washington Metrorail Safety Commis-sion, P.L. 1l5–54, and the Committee on Foreign Relations, for the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanc-tions Act, P.L. 115–44, out of compli-ance. In total, authorizing committees are estimated to increase outlays by near-ly $2 billion more than they were allo-cated over the fiscal year 2017–2026 pe-riod. The largest spending violation since the passage of the current budget resolution occurred during this report-ing period. The VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017, P.L. 115–46, increased budget authority by $2 bil-lion and outlays by $1.9 billion over the fiscal year 2017–2026 window. Tables 2–3 of this report, related to activities of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, remain unchanged from my previous report. In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget totals approved by the Congress. CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017, which helps

enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA section 311. CBO’s estimates show that current law levels of spending for fiscal year 2017 exceed the amounts assumed in the budget resolution for budget au-thority by $1.8 billion. However, levels for outlays remain nearly $6.4 billion below assumed levels. CBO also esti-mates that revenues are $1 million above assumed levels for fiscal year 2017 and $8 million above assumed lev-els over the fiscal year 2017–2026 period. Two pieces of legislation, the FDA Re-authorization Act of 2017, P.L. 115–52, and the Countering America’s Adver-saries through Sanctions Act, in-creased revenues this reporting period. The former increased revenues by $7 million over 10 years and the latter by $22 million over the same period. Social Security levels are consistent with the budget resolution’s fiscal year 2017 figures. CBO’s report also provides informa-tion needed to enforce the Senate pay- as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate’s PAYGO scorecard currently shows in-creased deficits of $2.5 billion over the fiscal year 2016–2021 and $1.9 billion over fiscal year 2016–2026 periods. Over the fiscal year 2016–2021 period, legisla-tion has been enacted that CBO esti-mates will increase outlays by $2.5 bil-lion and reduce revenues by $20 mil-lion. Over the fiscal year 2016–2026 pe-riod, legislation has been enacted that CBO estimates will increase outlays by $1.9 billion and increase revenues by $3 million. The Senate’s PAYGO rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolu-tion. Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate’s budget enforcement activity on the floor. Three budget points of order have been raised since my last filing, and each was successful. All of these points of order occurred during the Senate’s con-sideration of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.

EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The enclosed report shows the effects of Congressional action on the fiscal year 2017 budget and is current through September 5, 2017. This report is submitted under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended. The estimates of budget authority, out-lays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con. Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2017. Since our last letter dated July 12, 2017, the Congress has cleared and the President has signed the VA Choice and Quality Em-ployment Act (Public Law 115–46). That act has significant effects on budget authority in fiscal year 2017. Sincerely, K
EITH HALL, Director. Enclosure.

aIncludes the budgetary effects of enacted legislation cleared by the Congress during the 114th session, prior to the adoption o f S. Con. Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2017. 
bSections 193–195 of P.L. 114–223 (as amended by Division A of P.L. 114–254), provided funding for innovation projects and state  responses to opioid abuse. CBO estimated that for fiscal year 2017, these sections provided a com- bined $872 million in budget authority, which would result in $256 million in outlays. However, consistent with sections 1001–1 004 of P.L. 114–255, for the purposes of estimating the budgetary effects of those provisions under the Con- gressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Budget Control Act) and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Contro l Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act), those amounts are estimated to provide no budget authority or out- lays. 
cFor purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate,  does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current level does not include these items. 
dPeriodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in S. Con. Res. 3, pursuant to various provisions  of the resolution. The total for the Initial Senate Resolution shown below excludes $81,872 million in budget authority and $40,032 million in outlays assumed in S. Con. Res. 3 for non regular discretionary spending, including spe nding that qualifies for adjustments to discretionary spending limits pursuant to section 251(b) of the Deficit Control Act.

BUDGETARY REVISIONS Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory limits on discre-tionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those limits, while sec-tions 302 and 3141(a) of the Congres-sional Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to alloca-tions, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments The Senate is considering S. Amdt. 808, which pro-vides emergency funding for disaster relief. This legislation includes language that increases nonsecurity discre-tionary budget authority by $15,250 million this year and designates it as emergency funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO esti-mates that this budget authority will not outlay in 2017. As a result of the aforementioned designations, I am revising the alloca-tion to the Committee on Appropria-tions by increasing the revised non-security budget authority by $15,250 million Further, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2017 by $15,250 million in budget authority. I ask unanimous consent that the ac-companying tables, which provide de-tails about the adjustment, be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

NATIONAL EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS REDUCTION PROGRAM REAU-THORIZATION ACT OF 2017 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yes-terday, along with several of my col-leagues, I introduced the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 2017. This bill would reauthorize a na-tional program to improve the Nation’s earthquake preparedness. Senators M
URKOWSKI , G ARDNER , M URRAY , W
YDEN , HARRIS , M ERKLEY , and C ANT-
WELL are original cosponsors of this bill, and I thank them for their sup-port. I firmly believe that, when it comes to a catastrophic earthquake, it is not a matter of if it will occur, it is a mat-ter of when. It is important that we recognize the threats posed by earth-quakes and do all we can to plan for the worst. By reauthorizing the Na-tional Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, we will ensure that vital re-search, assistance to States, and devel-opment of early-warning systems con-tinue. Earthquakes threaten many areas in the United States—some densely popu-lated, some not. The National Earth-quake Hazards Reduction Program helps four Federal agencies—the Na-tional Institute of Standards and Tech-nology, the Federal Emergency Man-agement Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Science Foundation—coordinate earthquake re-search and education activities, as well as develop and disseminate informa-tion and best practices in order to pro-tect public safety. The most recent re-authorization expired in 2009. While there is still much that we do not know about earthquakes, we do know that there are many actions that we can take to reduce earthquake risk. We can map active fault lines and uti-lize geological knowledge to inform where we build. Research can help ar-chitects to design buildings that are more earthquake-resistant, as well as ensure that critical infrastructure such as hospitals and powerplants are able to function after an earthquake strikes. Outreach and better coordina-tion can help prepare response efforts, and developing an early-warning sys-tem is a critical tool to guard against severe loss of life. The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act would enable earthquake-prone communities to better prepare and pro-tect themselves by minimizing losses through infrastructure improvements and hazard and risk assessments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5052 September 7, 2017 
The key provisions of the bill would permanently reauthorize the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Pro-gram, NEHRP; remove outdated lan-guage related to earthquake prediction and instead emphasizes the continued development of earthquake early-warn-ing systems through the Advanced Na-tional Seismic System; require the pro-duction of a set of maps showing active faults and folds, liquefaction suscepti-bility, and other hazards that can be induced by an earthquake, such as landslides; reduce various administra-tive burdens for Federal agencies that are disruptive to the essential mission of the program and improves data shar-ing between agencies; enhance coordi-nation among Federal agencies and with State agencies; provide clear di-rection to the four Federal agencies charged with overseeing NEHRP—the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Geologi-cal Survey, and the National Science Foundation—to continue working with States and private sector experts on performance-based design features; di-rect the Federal Emergency Manage-ment Agency to implement a grant program to assist States with incor-porating earthquakes in their hazard reduction portfolios; and direct the completion of a comprehensive assess-ment of the Nation’s earthquake risk reduction progress, as well as remain-ing areas that require more funding. The bill has the support of a wide array of groups, including the Amer-ican Institute of Architects, the Amer-ican Society of Civil Engineers, the As-sociation of American State Geolo-gists, the Earthquake Engineering Re-search Institute, the Geological Soci-ety of America, the National Council of Structural Engineers Association, the National Emergency Management As-sociation, the Seismological Society of America, and the Structural Engineers Association of California. I thank those groups for supporting this bill. We have made much progress to cre-ate a more earthquake-resilient na-tion, but we can do more. This bill pro-vides a positive step forward to ensure that we build on the work that has al-ready been done and continue investing in policies that reduce the risk to life, property, and livelihoods as a result of an earthquake. I thank the Senators who have joined me in cosponsoring this bill, and I urge the full Senate to promptly take up this bill and pass it as soon as possible.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE CARTER COUNTY MUSEUM ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct honor of rec-ognizing the Carter County Museum in Ekalaka, MT. The Carter County Mu-seum is a treasure to our State and well worth the time to stop in and visit if you are traveling through eastern Montana. The Carter County Museum has helped preserve the history of eastern Montana for over 80 years and was the first county museum in the State. This region of our State is known for plenti-ful dinosaur discoveries, and one of the exhibits at the Carter County Museum includes a complete skull of a Triceratops. Recent regional history is also on display at the museum. Arti-facts from American Indian Tribes and late 19th century homesteaders help visitors gain a deeper appreciation for the history of the 41st State to join the Union. Over the past two summers, members of the museum’s staff have used their expertise to help recover the remains of a Columbian mammoth along the Powder River. Just last month, the staff unearthed a mostly intact skull, including both tusks. It is uncommon to find a museum that offers such a unique collection of rare exhibits out-side of a major population center, but that is precisely what you will find at the Carter County Museum. Eastern Montana, widely recognized for its contributions to our Nation in the areas of agriculture and energy, is also home to many items of cultural significance. Local gems like the Car-ter County Museum and all of the folks that make its day-to-day operations possible help make Montana an excep-tional place.∑ f 
30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DE-PARTMENT OF VETERANS AF-FAIRS COMMUNITY BASED OUT-PATIENT CLINIC IN CARIBOU, MAINE ∑Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the 30th anniversary of the Department of Vet-erans Affairs Community Based Out-patient Clinic, CBOC, in Caribou, ME. Aroostook County in northern Maine is known as the Crown of Maine. It is not just a delineation of the geography of Maine, but a designation of leader-ship. That leadership is nowhere more apparent than in the story of the Car-ibou CBOC and the veterans who fought for years to bring it into exist-ence. Meo Bosse, John Rowe, Raphael ‘‘Ray’’ Guerrette, Percy Thibeault, Wesley Adams, Walter Corey, and Leonard Woods, Sr., did not necessarily imagine that their vision would grow from a first in the Nation clinic to a network of nearly a thousand CBOCs assisting millions of rural veterans; they just saw a need that they could help fill. Since 1987, the Caribou CBOC has been providing veterans with physical, mental health, and administrative services. When it was established, it was the first of Togus’s community based outpatient clinics and the first rural VA clinic in our Nation. It is the commitment of individuals like these veterans in rural Maine and countless others that have carried the standard alongside and after that has helped the VA extend its reach and care to rural veterans across the coun-try. CBOCs and changing models of care for veterans have become vital in how the VA more seamlessly delivers care to those that have answered the call of duty. The partnerships with rural hos-pitals like CARY Medical Center have enabled more responsive care to our Nation’s veterans and deepened ties within these communities. It gives me great pleasure that the Crown of Maine showed the way for hundreds of other sites around the country and that CARY and the veterans of northern Maine continue to support new oppor-tunities to strengthen the networks of care for our veterans.∑ f

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mr. M
ARKEY , Mr. W YDEN , Ms. H AR-
RIS, and Ms. W ARREN ): S. 1772. A bill to remove all statues of individuals who voluntarily served the Confederate States of America from display in the Capitol of the United States; to the Committee on Rules and Administration. Mr. BOOKER. Mr.President, today I rise to speak about the introduction of the Confederate Monument Removal Act. This legislation would properly re-move certain statues on display in the Capitol as part of the National Stat-uary Hall Collection so they can be ex-hibited elsewhere in the proper histor-ical context. I am proud to introduce this legislation today and I want to thank Representative B
ARBARA LEEfor her leadership in the House on this bill. On July 2, 1864, a law was enacted that created the National Statuary Hall Collection, which allows states to select two statues of deceased individ-uals to be displayed in the Capitol. States are supposed to choose people ‘‘who have been citizens thereof, and il-lustrious for their historic renown or for distinguished civil or military serv-ices.’’ Figures like George Washington, Samuel Adams, and Dwight D. Eisen-hower grace the collection and are prominently on display in the Capitol. The collection is meant to honor patri-ots who served, sacrificed, or made tre-mendous contributions to our Nation. People who served the Confederate States of America do not deserve that honor. These are individuals who took up arms against the Union and in-flicted catastrophic death and suffering among United States citizens. Simply put, they fall well short of that high bar. Moreover, the presence of these stat-ues in the National Statuary Hall Col-lection ignores the context in which

these monuments were first erected. Statues of Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis were erected across the United States in the post-Reconstruction era and during the civil rights movement as symbols of white suppression and de-fiance of Federal authority. They do not represent Southern heritage and those who advocate thus are engaging in revisionist history and are white-washing our past. That is why I am introducing the Confederate Monument Removal Act, a bill that would mandate the removal of all eleven statues of people who volun-tarily served the Confederate States of America from the National Statuary Hall Collection in the Capitol within 120 days. The list of statues that would be removed includes Joseph Wheeler of Alabama, Uriah Milton Rose of Arkan-sas, Edmund Kirby Smith of Florida, Zebulon Vance of North Carolina, Alex-ander Hamilton Stephens of Georgia, Edward Douglas White of Louisiana, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, James Zachariah George of Mississippi, Wade Hampton of South Carolina, Robert E. Lee of Virginia, and John Kenna of West Virginia. The legislation would allow a State who selected the statue to be displayed in the collection to reclaim the statue if they pay for its transportation back to the State. If a State declines to re-claim it back, it would turn possession of the statue over to the Smithsonian, an institution that is more than capa-ble of displaying the statues in the proper historical context and where a constructive dialogue can take place about our Nation’s history. I am grateful that this legislation is endorsed by organizations such as the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Associa-tion for the Advancement of Colored People, and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Some have argued that this will lead to the removal of other statues and monuments of prominent figures who played an important role in our Na-tion’s history. That is plainly false. This bill only touches on those who were traitors against their Country and whose statues were erected as a symbol of white supremacy. It is true that the Confederate Monu-ment Removal Act does not remove certain statues in the Capitol that some people find offensive and who ar-guably should not be honored in such a way. For instance, the bill would not remove the statue of John C. Calhoun, a white supremacist and a vigorous de-fender of slavery. This is a conversa-tion we as a Nation must have regard-ing how to best tell the truth of our past. But surely we can all agree that peo-ple who took up arms against their Country should not be venerated in the Capitol, a place all Americans should feel welcomed, encouraged, and in-spired. These statues must be moved not just because of who they were in the past, but because of who we are now as a Nation and who we must be to ensure an even better and brighter fu-ture for generations to come. I am proud to introduce the Confed-erate Monument Removal Act and I urge its speedy passage.

S. R ES. 250 Whereas the Rohingya are one of Burma’s many ethnic minorities that have lived under military dictatorship for most of the last few decades; Whereas approximately 1,000,000 Rohingya live predominantly in Burma’s Rakhine State, where they have faced ongoing repres-sion under the Burmese military, including the revocation of their citizenship, killings, and mass rape; Whereas there is historical animosity be-tween the majority Buddhist population and the minority Rohingya, with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as il-legal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh despite generational roots; Whereas since 1999, the Department of State has regularly expressed concern over legal, economic, and social discrimination against Burma’s Rohingya population; Whereas an outbreak of communal vio-lence in the Rakhine State in 2012 saw more than 100,000 displaced, and tens of thousands of Rohingya forced into squalid camps where travel was, and continues to be, restricted; Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Burma re-ported ‘‘a long history of discrimination and persecution against the Rohingya’’; Whereas Aung San Suu Kyi spent 15 years under house arrest for her peaceful advocacy of democracy in Burma, and during those years she was awarded the Sakharov human rights prize from the European Parliament, the Nobel Peace Prize, the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Con-gressional Gold Medal for her tireless strug-gle for democracy and human rights; Whereas in her 2012 Nobel lecture Aung San Suu Kyi made an impassioned appeal to the world— (1) not to forget those who are suffering ‘‘hunger, disease, displacement, joblessness, poverty, injustice, discrimination, prejudice, bigotry’’ and war; and (2) that ‘‘wherever suffering is ignored, there will be the seeds of conflict, for suf-fering degrades and embitters and enrages’’; Whereas in a landmark election held in No-vember 2015, Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won a landslide vic-tory in the first national vote since Burma’s nominal transition to civilian authority, after which Aung San Suu Kyi was named State Counsellor, a role created for her that made her the country’s de facto leader; Whereas in August 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi helped to establish the high-level Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, which is headed by former United Nations Secretary- General Kofi Annan, in order to address the mistreatment of the Rohingya; Whereas in October 2016, attacks on border police outposts led to reports of horrific human rights abuses against the Rohingya in a brutal military crackdown; Whereas in December 2016, a letter to the United Nations Security Council, which was

the knowledge leader in low cost, no mainte-nance engine designs with unmatched field reliability. (3) The United States small turbine engine industrial base is at a critical juncture, as military requirements have tapered and mis-sile programs, in misguided attempts to save money, are narrowing production contracts to a single vendor causing two of the three existing small turbine engine manufacturers to go out of business. (4) The departure of these companies from the United States small turbine engine in-dustry will leave only one viable, proven source for small turbine engines for the De-partment of Defense. (5) In 2016, a number of engine failures were encountered that severely diminished the throughput of the F107–WR–101 engine main-tenance process for the AGM–86 Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), thereby putting the weapon system at major readi-ness risk. (6) The narrowing of the United States small turbine engine industrial base would leave the Department with a sole source United States supplier resulting in a loss of manufacturing and testing capability that would be extremely detrimental to both the United States industrial base and national security by creating a single point of failure, increasing engine procurement and testing prices by eliminating competition, raising new engine development and air vehicle pro-gram risk, and eliminating capabilities and expertise that would require decades and millions of dollars to reconstitute. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of the Congress that the Department of Defense should— (1) allocate sufficient funding to properly sustain the F107 turbine engine in order to ensure this vital weapon is viable until a re-placement is fielded; and (2) contract with multiple, capable engine manufacturers to stabilize and revitalize the United States small turbine engine indus-trial base.

SEC. ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FIRE PROTEC-TION IN DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FACILITIES. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the fol-lowing findings: (1) A 2009 Consumer Product Safety Com-mission study found a full 370,000 residential fires are suppressed by portable fire extin-guishers annually. (2) Throughout the United States, of the 48,460 fires in buildings equipped with sprin-klers from 2007 to 2011, 40,440, or 83 percent, never grew large enough to activate sprin-klers, indicating many fires are successfully suppressed by portable fire extinguishers. (3) Section 9-17.1 of the Unified Facilities Criteria 3-600-01 changes the Department of Defense building code by stating, ‘‘General purpose portable fire extinguishers are not required when the Facility is provided with complete automatic sprinkler protection and a fire alarm system in accordance with this UFC.’’ (4) This new language is a departure from national model fire codes, and is also a sig-nificant change from the last Unified Cri-teria governing portable extinguishers. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) portable fire extinguishers are essential to the safety of members of the Armed Forces and their families; (2) the current United Facilities Criteria provides members of the Armed Forces, their families, and other Department of Defense personnel with less fire protection than that of civilian counterparts by deviating from fire safety codes used across the country and not requiring portable extinguishers on mili-tary installations; (3) United Facilities Criteria 3-600-01, Sec-tion 4-9, dated September 26, 2006, clearly keeps Department of Defense Facilities in line with the national and international standards for fire safety; and (4) the Secretary of Defense should amend current United Facilities Criteria Section 9- 17.1 to reflect the standards established by United Facilities Criteria 3-600-01, Section 4- 9, dated September 26, 2006.

(c) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board was chartered by Congress with an im-portant mission to provide independent rec-ommendations and advice to the President and the Secretary of Energy to protect pub-lic health and employee safety at defense nu-clear facilities of the Department of Energy; (2) the role of the Board has necessarily evolved as the mission of the Department has changed over time, but the Board will continue to be vitally important as the De-partment continues major efforts to mod-ernize the nuclear weapons stockpile and up-date its infrastructure in the 21st century; and (3) any significant change to the Board and its mission can only be considered by the Board as a whole with oversight by Congress and requires legislative changes approved by Congress.

SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Ac-countability Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-lowing: (1) On March 17, 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry stated, ‘‘in my judgment, Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims . . . the United States will strongly support efforts to col-lect, document, preserve, and analyze the evidence of atrocities, and we will do all we can to see that the perpetrators are held ac-countable’’. (2) Secretary of State Kerry stated in the ‘‘Atrocities Prevention Report’’, transmitted to Congress on March 17, 2016, ‘‘The Depart-ment of State has a longstanding commit-ment to providing support for the urgent hu-manitarian needs of conflict-affected popu-lations in Iraq, Syria, and across the world, including but not limited to members of eth-nic and religious minorities.’’. (3) The Independent International Commis-sion of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic stated in its February 3, 2016, report, ‘‘The Government has committed the crimes against humanity of extermination, murder, rape or other forms of sexual violence, tor-ture, imprisonment, enforced disappearance and other inhuman acts. Based on the same conduct, war crimes have also been com-mitted. Both Jabhat Al-Nusra and some anti-Government armed groups have com-mitted the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, and torture.’’. (4) The International Criminal Investiga-tive Training Assistance Program and the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Develop-ment Assistance and Training of the Depart-ment of Justice have provided technical as-sistance to governmental judicial and law enforcement entities in Iraq, including with funding support from the Department of State. (5) There were an estimated 800,000 to 1,400,000 Christians in Iraq in 2002, 500,000 in 2013, and less than 250,000 in 2015, according to the annual International Religious Free-dom Reports of the Department of State. (6) Although Christians were an estimated 8 to 10 percent of the 21,000,000 person popu-lation of Syria in 2010, ‘‘media and other re-ports of Christians fleeing the country as a result of the civil war suggest the Christian population is now considerably lower’’ as of 2015, according to the annual International Religious Freedom Reports of the Depart-ment of State. (7) The Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil (Iraq) is an example of an entity that has not received funding from any govern-ment and has been providing assistance to internally displaced families of Yezidis, Mus-lims, and Christians, including food, reset-tlement from tents to permanent housing, and rent for Yezidis, medical care and edu-cation for Yezidis and Muslims through clin-ics, schools, and a university that are open to all, and some form of these types of assist-ance to all of the estimated 10,500 internally displaced Christian families, more than 70,000 people, in the greater Erbil region. (8) Through the United States Refugee Ad-missions Program, the United States Gov-ernment— (A) admitted 12,676 Iraqi refugees in fiscal year 2015, including at least 2,113 Christians and 213 Yezidis; (B) admitted 9,880 Iraqi refugees in fiscal year 2016, including at least 1,524 Christians and 393 Yezidis; (C) admitted 1,682 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2015, including at least 30 Christians; and (D) admitted 12,587 Syrian refugees in fis-cal year 2016, including at least 64 Christians and 24 Yezidis. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—Congress— (1) strongly condemns— (A) the ongoing violence, use of chemical weapons, targeting of civilian populations with barrel, incendiary, and cluster bombs and SCUD missiles, and systematic gross human rights violations carried out by the Government of Syria and pro-government forces under the direction of President Bashar al-Assad; and (B) all abuses committed by violent ex-tremist groups and other combatants in-volved in the civil war in Syria; (2) expresses its support for the people of Syria seeking democratic change; (3) urges all parties to the conflict— (A) to immediately halt indiscriminate at-tacks on civilians; (B) to allow for the delivery of humani-tarian and medical assistance; and (C) to end sieges of civilian populations; (4) calls on the President to support efforts in Syria, and on the part of the international community, to ensure accountability for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and geno-cide committed during the conflict; and (5) supports the request in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), and 2191 (2014) for the Secretary-Gen-eral to regularly report to the Security Council on implementation on the resolu-tions, including of paragraph 2 of Resolution 2139, which ‘‘demands that all parties imme-diately put an end to all forms of violence [and] cease and desist from all violations of international humanitarian law and viola-tions and abuses of human rights’’.

INVESTING IN HEALTHCARE RESEARCH Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I come to you after we have been able to pass out of the Appropriations Com-mittee the bill to fund the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Depart-ment of Education. I want to talk par-ticularly about what happened in that funding, which is now out of committee and ready for the full Senate to act on it and then the Congress to act on it, as it relates to healthcare research. We were able in our committee to have a bipartisan bill. I had a chance to begin to chair that committee 3 years ago. Senator M
URRAY from Washington State is the leading Democrat on that committee. For the previous 6 years— the previous 5 years plus that first budget for which I was the chair—we weren’t able to have a bipartisan bill. But the last 2 years, we have decided that we could figure out how to come together with this committee that ac-tually appropriates about 30 percent of all the appropriated dollars that the Congress deals with and find a way to move forward in a bipartisan way. Cer-tainly, Senator M
URRAY is an impor-tant part of that partnership, and we were able to take our bill to the com-mittee today. Maybe the thing that we did that will have the most long-term significance in that bill was that, for the third year in a row, we were able to increase healthcare research at the National In-stitutes of Health. Now, for the 12 years that ended 3 years ago, there had been zero increase in healthcare re-search in this country. Research, whether it is ag research or health research or other research, is one of the things that the government has done for a long time and can really commit itself to in ways that the pri-vate sector cannot. So when you begin to hold back the healthcare research here, not only do people not have the same potential they have to have their health challenges met and their family health challenges met, but we also hold back our ability to move forward with lifesaving cures and lifesaving prac-tices in an economy where that makes a difference and in a world where these things are changing quickly. So just 3 years ago, the people who run the National Institutes of Health and researchers around the country said that, having had no increase in a dozen years, they were basically 22 per-cent behind where they had been 12 years earlier in just research buying power. Young researchers were leaving the field of research because they were

really disadvantaged in a world where research dollars were effectively going down and people who had had success-ful research before had a much better chance to know how to get and then to be awarded a grant that young re-searchers weren’t getting. So 2 years ago, last year, and again today—2 years ago and last year, suc-cessfully—the Congress said: Now we are going to make a substantial in-crease to healthcare research. It was $2 billion each of those 2 years, which was about a 6.6-percent increase in healthcare research. Today we pro-posed another $2 billion, and just like the previous 2 years, we really had no new money. So we had to figure out how to prioritize, eliminating pro-grams. I think over the 3 years we have now eliminated over 30 programs that just simply weren’t performing well or performing well enough to be a pri-ority. As the Presiding Officer and I have talked about before, when everything is a priority, nothing is really a pri-ority. So we decided this is one of our priorities, and probably, we can safely suggest, a top priority for this com-mittee now over the last 3 years. So we have gone from a 22-percent decline to where we are almost caught up to where the country was 15 years ago, in terms of buying power, with about a 20- percent increase in this one account in three budgets. Again, I think it is important for us and the taxpayers to understand we did that because other things were care-fully looked at and either had their amounts reduced or had their programs eliminated so we could look at the health research. In that 12-year period of time, there had been such a decline in commitment to health research that often the health research projects that were funded weren’t funded in a way that allowed them to have success. At some Institutes at NIH, the success ratio was as low as 9 percent, and even when you are looking at everything, 9 percent is, frankly, too low. I hope we are going to see some real breakthroughs as a part of that re-search. One of the areas that has been a part of that research has been the in-vestment in Alzheimer’s research. Every 68 seconds, someone in America develops Alzheimer’s, and this is a dis-ease that not only impacts in a dra-matic way the person who has it but arguably impacts, in at least as dra-matic a way, the people who care about them and do all they can to care for them. It is the most expensive disease in America. As our population gets older, more and more people get into that age realm where if something doesn’t change, they are going to have Alzheimer’s too. Right now we are spending right at 250 billion tax dollars every year on Alzheimer’s-related care. That is about half the defense budget. The estimate for 2050 is that if something doesn’t change, we will be spending $1.1 trillion of today’s dollars on Alzheimer’s-re-lated care. We talk about big numbers here, and it is easy to get confused. That is a lot or that is half of that—what does that really mean? Well, $1.1 trillion is twice the defense budget. If you can get in your mind all we spend all over the world to defend the country, if we don’t do something to change what is hap-pening with Alzheimer’s, we are going to be spending twice everything we spend to defend the country just on taxpayer-related Alzheimer’s care. The estimate on Alzheimer’s, by the way, is that for every tax dollar spent on Alzheimer’s, there are two private dollars spent and almost never covered by insurance. It has a dramatic impact on people, dramatic impact on their families, and a dramatic impact on taxpayers. We are spending about $1 on Alzheimer’s research right now for every $125 we spend on Medicare and Medicaid. The biggest expenditure in those two funds of any disease is what we spend on Alzheimer’s. Hopefully, we will see changes in that and begin to see things develop there. Also, on the BRAIN Initiative, there has been nearly a 54-percent boost over last year’s level in the BRAIN Initia-tive. The BRAIN Initiative, as part of the 21st Century Cures legislation we voted for, is really developing a more complete understanding of brain func-tion. It has the possibility of helping millions of people who suffer from a wide variety of neurological chal-lenges, psychiatric and behavioral dis-orders, diseases like Alzheimer’s, Par-kinson’s, and traumatic brain injuries in addition to that. It is all part of what we can look at as part of the BRAIN Initiative for psychiatric dis-orders. Remember, the estimate is that one out of every four adult Americans has a diagnosable and almost always treat-able behavioral health issue. If you know that issue, if you know how the brain works in a better way, the treat-ment may be easier, better, more effec-tive, and more long-term than it is now. The National Cancer Institute is looking at the Precision Medicine Ini-tiative. This is where we utilize all we know now about the human genome and about environmental and lifestyle data to see if we can come up with so-lutions. Genomically, we didn’t know any of this a generation ago, but with the human genome, now that we know what we know, we can look at how we individually are different than every-body else. There is a great feeling that in many cancers, there is a unique can-cer-fighting agent for that unique can-cer in you, but what you need to do is amp up that cancer-fighting agent. The Federal Drug Administration just last week approved the first T cell-amping treatment that would do that. Senator T
OOMEY and I went 2 years ago to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and saw the work that Dr. Carl June was doing, the groundbreaking work on leukemia. Again, he was amping up that fighting cell in patients whom everybody else had given up on and had great success and caused great optimism about what can happen there. Dr. Tim Eberlein, director of the Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis, testified before our subcommittee on the critical role of Federal support for looking at these kinds of things and seeing what can happen to make a dif-ference. He shared a story of one of his col-leagues, Dr. Lukas Wartman, an oncologist and leukemia survivor, who had a relapse while, fortunately for him, he was a fellow at Washington University. Research performed a de-tailed analysis of Dr. Wartman’s cancer genome profile. They identified an ex-isting drug typically used to treat a different kind of cancer, but it targeted the kinds of genetic structures that Dr. Wartman had, and he is in remission. It enabled him to undergo a stem cell transplant. He is now continuing his work on behalf of other cancer pa-tients. Whether it is immunology—again, amping up of what you have to fight that unique challenge that you have, whether it is looking at the BRAIN Ini-tiative, these are things that make a difference to families, they make a dif-ference to taxpayers, they make a dif-ference to our economy, and certainly we hope seeing the committee move forward today on what would be the third groundbreaking commitment by the Congress in recent years to make a difference here is an important thing. I hope we get a chance to bring this bill so all the Senators get a chance, as our Members did today, to debate it, to amend it, but no matter what happens on the floor of the Senate, we will have a chance to talk to our colleagues in the House and, hopefully, once again, in the final appropriations bill this year, do what makes a difference. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BLUNT ). Without objection, it is so or-dered.

CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to deliver my ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ speech, which I do every week that the Senate is in session. We have been out of session for a few weeks, so there is a fair amount to talk about that happened while we were gone. One of the first things was a new study in my home State of Rhode Is-land. Rhode Island is a coastal State. We have considerable worries about sea level rise, and we have a State Coastal Resources Management Council that has done what is probably the best modeling anywhere in the country of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5080 September 7, 2017 
the effects of sea level rise and the risk of ocean storms on our shores. In con-junction with them, there has been a report from the Rhode Island Division of Planning—this is the State govern-ment—which has identified roads and bridges that are most likely to be un-derwater as the tides climb higher and as waves push farther inland. The State’s 10 roads most vulnerable to sea level rise are Hope Street in Bristol, which everybody knows—a beautiful, historical street; Memorial Boulevard in Newport; Wampanoag Trail in Barrington; Conanicus Avenue in Jamestown; North Road in James-town; County Road in Barrington; Beach Street in Narragansett, Main Street in Warren; and State Highway 24 South in Tiverton. Throw in storm surge on top of sea level rise, and the 10 most vulnerable roads are County Road North in Bar-rington; Phillips Street in North Kingstown; America’s Cup Avenue in Newport; Route 138 West onramp in Newport; Hope Street in Bristol; High-way 24 North in Portsmouth; Centerville Road in Warwick; Narra-gansett Avenue in Narragansett; Main Street in Warren; and Route 38 West in Jamestown. The report goes on to identify the 10 bridges most vulnerable to sea level rise and the 10 bridges most vulnerable to a combination of sea level rise and storm surge. Overall, Warwick, Narragansett, Newport, Barrington, and Providence are our top five municipalities most vulnerable to climate change-related road damage. So when I come to the floor to talk about this, this is not some hypothetical, liberal concern. The Coastal Resources Management Council in my home State is predicting 9 vertical feet of sea level rise by the end of this century. As the Presiding Officer knows, Rhode Island is not a huge State. We don’t have a lot to give back to the ocean. Nine feet of sea level rise is potentially catastrophic. And when my State Division of Plan-ning is highlighting the roads and bridges that we are going to lose to sea level rise and to storm surge, don’t ex-pect me to sit idly by. There is a larger context, of course, for all of this. I am pretty Rhode Is-land-centric, but, boy, are we seeing a lot going on. Let’s start off with what is going on out West. We have an extraordinary wildfire situation happening in the American West. I am reading a news story here: 
Wildfires burned across hundreds of thou-sands of acres in the American and Canadian West this week, fueled by scorching tempera-tures that are breaking heat and fire records across the region. In California, at least 15 cities have seen record-breaking heat. The State has experi-enced its hottest summer on record. San Francisco hit 106 degrees over the weekend, breaking its previous high ever by 3 full de-grees. By the end of the day Tuesday, there were at least 81 large fires blazing across 1.5 mil-lion acres of the U.S. West, from Colorado, to California, and north to Washington. ‘‘These unprecedented extreme events are exactly the types of events that are more likely due to the global warming that has already occurred,’’ say the scientists. 
Studies find that a warmed global atmos-phere with increasingly clear human finger-prints will continue driving a potent mix of heat and dryness that is projected to esca-late in the West. 
The climate scientist at UCLA says: ‘‘That’s not a future projection, but an observational reality, and that is some-thing that we expect to increase in the future. When we get these extremes, there is a human fingerprint.’’ ‘‘The increased occurrence of severe heat and the role of global warming on the occurrence of severe heat, that is already happening,’’ said a Stanford scientific researcher. This is not a fluke. 
Nine of the 10 worst fire seasons in the past 50 years have all happened since 2000. And 2015 was the worst fire s in U.S. history, sur-passing 10 million acres burned for the first time ever recorded. So far this year, wildfires in the U.S. are at 7.8 million acres, but the fire season is far from over. 
Researchers have shown that human- induced climate change accounted for about half the observed increase in fuel aridity, or forest dryness, that has been setting off these fires in the Western United States since 1979 and that this had nearly doubled the area of the U.S. West affected by forest fires since 1984. The conclusion: 
We know that global warming has already increased the probability of unprecedented high temperatures in the western U.S., in-cluding in California. And we know— 
‘‘We know,’’ the scientists say— 
with high confidence that continued global warming will continue to intensify those in-creases. Last week in Montana, a 20-square-mile blaze burned the historic Sperry Chalet, a hotel and dining room built in 1914 only reachable by trail. 
It had been there for more than 100 years, but this is the fire that burned it down. This means a lot out at Glacier National Park. 
‘‘It’s hard to think about the magnitude of what’s happened,’’ the National Park Conser-vancy Executive Director Doug Mitchell said. 
One of the western fires even jumped the Columbia River to burn across into Washington—the Eagle Creek fire. As the news said, in Oregon’s Colum-bia River Gorge, a blaze known as the Eagle Creek Fire has jumped the Co-lumbia River and is inching into the State of Washington, creating dra-matic and dangerous scenes. Another news report called this a devastating summer in which an area larger than a certain State has burned. I would hate to have Rhode Island be used as the unit of measure, but that is what they said: An area larger than Rhode Island has burned this summer. And they are looking not just at the loss of the Sperry Chalet but poten-tially losing Lake McDonald Lodge—‘‘a loss that would,’’ says a historian who has worked at the lodge for years, ‘‘be unimaginably devastating.’’ ‘‘These are some of the most remark-able buildings anywhere in the United States and they are an integral part of the Glacier experience and the Glacier tradition.’’ They are either burned or at risk of burning. If you are in those Western States, it is not just in the high, dry forests; if you go down to the oceans, climate change is whacking away at them too. The Oregon and Washington razor clam fisheries are currently closed due to high levels of domoic acid. Domoic acid is a toxin that is produced by algae—the algae Pseudo-nitzchia—and algae are associated with climate change. For instance, a record-break-ing red tide in 2015 was likely linked to climate change, and we are going to see a lot more of that in the future. Now, of course, the dry part of what is happening in our climate has really been drowned out by what we are see-ing on the wet part. The New York Times recently ran an article saying: Climate change doesn’t cause extreme events, it amplifies them. On the climate side of risk, we have unambiguous evidence that the hazards are changing. Our emissions of heat-trapping gases have already in-creased the likelihood and severity of heat waves, extreme rainfalls, and storm surges. Scientists can now even evaluate how much climate change has increased the odds of in-dividual extreme events, including rainfall and flooding. We certainly understand the mechanisms. Put simply, a warmer atmos-phere can hold more water, increasing the potential for heavy downpours. Storm surge now occurs on top of sea level rise, increasing flooding risks. 
We know by the law of thermal ex-pansion why the seas rise when they warm, and we have measured that they are warming with a very complicated device called the thermometer. 
Warmer oceans in turn produce more in-tense hurricanes. 
We know that as well, as has oc-curred in the North Atlantic and the gulf. The article continues that ‘‘unprece-dented is increasingly the norm,’’ and it notes that ‘‘up to 8 feet of sea level rise is possible in this century.’’ Rhode Island is in a unique place, so we are riding higher than average, and we are looking at potentially 9 feet of sea level rise. Harvey has been an astonishing mon-ster of a storm. It was described in one article as 9 trillion gallons of water, a hydraulic cube over downtown Houston 4 miles square and 2 miles high. And then the author said: ‘‘The cube dou-bled to become the most extreme rain event in American history.’’ Harvey, by the way, is the third 500- year flood in the Houston area in the past 3 years. It dumped enough water in southeastern Texas to equal almost 20 times the daily discharge of the Mis-sissippi River. So while the wildfires are burning out West, this astonishing set of del-uges is happening elsewhere.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5081 September 7, 2017 
Land temperatures, according to NOAA, were the hottest they have ever been in 1,651 months of recordkeeping. July also marked 384 months since the last colder-than-average month in NASA’s database. So 384 months since we had a month that was colder than average, with July well warmer than average. The last 3 consecutive years— 2014, 2015, and 2016—each set a new global record for warmth, according to NOAA. Politico writes: ‘‘2016 confirmed as planet’s hottest year,’’ with the Na-tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-ministration documenting record- breaking global warming trends of 2016. The observed outcomes of swiftly ris-ing temperatures include the highest sea levels ever recorded, extremes in rain cycles, and declines in global ice and snow cover, with last year the third in a row breaking global tempera-ture records. ‘‘Several markers such as land and ocean temperatures, sea level and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere broke records set just one year prior,’’ the NOAA report said. ‘‘The long-term climate change is like riding up an escalator over time, and things like El Nino and La Nina are like jumping up and down on that esca-lator,’’ one of the NOAA scientists said. So that is what we are seeing—the underlying trend of climate change raising temperatures, with El Nino and La Nina creating a variation like jump-ing up and down on that escalator. 
Greenhouse gas concentrations are now higher than ever recorded. Global surface temperatures are the high-est on record. Sea levels are the highest they’ve ever been since record keeping began. Precipitation cycles are becoming more ex-treme. Antarctic sea ice levels are lower than ever recorded. Alpine glaciers have declined for 37 con-secutive years. There were more tropical cyclones. . . . 
Something is going on, and that well- known far-left liberal outlet, USA Today, had its editorial board say the following: 
Could proof grow any more powerful that humanity is responsible for a dangerously warming planet? 
It referenced the quadrennial Na-tional Climate Assessment: 
Scientists from 13 federal agencies found that a rapid rise in temperature since the 1980s in the United States represents the warmest period in 1,500 years. 
It quotes the report: 
Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emission of greenhouse gases, are primarily responsible. There are no alternative explanations. 
Do you hear that? ‘‘There are no al-ternative explanations,’’ and it keeps coming down. There was an article that came out while we were away on the great flood of 2016 in Louisiana: ‘‘The worst rain-storm in a rainy state’s history,’’ the article called it. 
In some places, more than 2 feet of rain fell over three days. . . . Research has shown it was . . . clearly linked to climate change. There were two separate teams of sci-entists that linked Louisiana’s great flood with climate change, and the State’s own meteorologist, a gen-tleman named Barry Keim, a professor at Louisiana State University, said that aspects of the August storm were consistent with climate change, and that both of the climate studies so far have shown it likely that climate change likely had its fingerprints on that Louisiana disaster. Indeed, in Louisiana, the State is mounting a massive battle against ris-ing seas as well as floods. Along the coast, ‘‘rising waters and escalating flood insurance rates,’’ the article says, ‘‘will drive thousands of families fur-ther inland, the state predicts, leaving behind homes’’—these families are leaving behind homes—‘‘they have known for generations,’’ leaving behind ‘‘places that have fundamentally shaped their identities.’’ One of the Louisianans living in the area in question said: ‘‘This is the first time that I can remember that a group came in and said it’s not going to be all right.’’ 
But over the next two generations [flood-ing in Louisiana along the marshes and coastal] will happen at an alarming scale, as the twin challenges of sinking land and ris-ing seas overtake ancestral homes at break-neck speed. In 50 years, the state estimates Terrebonne parish, whose name means ‘‘good earth’’ in the French that some of its resi-dents still speak, will lose 41 percent of its land mass. 
Areas are obviously going to lose their tax bases, the report says, ‘‘as ris-ing waters and increasing flood insur-ance rates drive most locals out.’’ 
The Louisiana planners had a leg up, since the environmental changes here have been so swift that many residents have seen land lost in their own lifetimes. 
When you are seeing it happen before your eyes, it is not so easy to deny it. Indeed, it is affecting local markets, and ‘‘new-gated communities advertise ‘higher elevations’ on bright [adver-tising] banners facing the highway.’’ In Louisiana: 
What had been the worst-case scenario for land loss when the legislature passed its 2012 version of the master plan became the best- case scenario in the latest version, approved by the legislature in June, thanks to updated sea-level rise estimates. 
So we are in Louisiana. We are in a Republican-controlled legislature, and they pass a master plan to address flooding in 2012. That master plan is based on a worst-case scenario. Just in the 5 years since then that worst-case scenario, the legislature has now up-dated that to become a best-case sce-nario, with the worst-case scenario far, far exceeding what they anticipated just as recently as 2012. ‘‘Climate change and water manage-ment practices could significantly alter the magnitude and variability of extreme flooding events, causing flood-ing to become nonstationary,’’ said the article, ‘‘Deciphering Deluges.’’ We have to come up with new ways on how to cope with sea level rise, off-shore storms, major tropical storms, downpours, and riverine flooding. Right now, our colleague BILLNEL-
SONhas left us this afternoon after the vote to go back down to Florida be-cause Hurricane Irma is steaming to-ward his State. Hurricane Irma is the most powerful storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. Experts say Irma’s strength is the result of unusually warm water for that part of the Atlan-tic. Guess what global warming does. It raises ocean temperatures. Do you know how much of the excess heat cre-ated has gone into the oceans? About 93 percent—virtually all of it. Thank goodness for the oceans. Without them, we would already be baking in climate change. So 93 percent went into the oceans, but, of course, that raises ocean temperatures, and on go the storms. If Irma stays on the forecast track and reaches the Florida Straits, the water there is warm enough that the already intense storm could become much worse, with wind speeds poten-tially reaching 225 mph, warned Kerry Emanuel, an MIT meteorology pro-fessor. ‘‘For the Florida Keys, if you were to create the worst case scenario, that is what we are looking at,’’ Monroe Coun-ty Emergency Operations Center Direc-tor Martin Senterfitt told CBS Miami. Even Tropical Storm Emily some time ago dumped enough rain on Miami Beach—7 inches of rainfall over several hours—that the pumps meant to drain the area went offline for near-ly an hour because the power was in-terrupted. The mayor, Tomas Regalado, used the flooding to make a case for a proposed $400 million bond initiative to help pump the water out. We have infrastructure demands that come from this disaster as well. A pretty good summary came, again, from an article in the New York Times, an editorial piece. What is going on? 
First, hurricanes arise from warm waters, and the Gulf of Mexico has warmed by two to four degrees Fahrenheit over the long-term average. The result is more intense storms. ‘‘There is a general consensus that the fre-quency of high-category (3, 4, and 5) hurri-canes should increase as the climate warms,’’ Kerry Emmanuel, a hurricane ex-pert at M.I.T., tells me. Second, as the air warms, it holds more water vapor, so the storms dump more rain. That’s why there’s been a big increase in heavy downpours. Nine of the top 10 years for heavy downpours in the U.S. have occurred since 1990. 
‘‘Climate change played a role in in-tensifying the winds and rainfall asso-ciated with Hurricane Harvey,’’ says Charles Greene, a climate scientist at Cornell. 
Last year was the third in a row to set a record for highest global average surface temperature, according to NASA. The 10 years of greatest loss of sea ice are all in the last decade. Houston has suffered three ‘‘500- year floods’’ in the last 3 years. 
So the author asks the question: Why can’t we all respect scientists’ pre-dictions about our cooking of our only

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5082 September 7, 2017 
planet? How is it that we don’t listen to the scientists on this, particularly right here in this room, in this Cham-ber? There are two very interesting arti-cles that came out while we were away that addressed this. One is about a phony group called the Cooler Heads Coalition, whose job is to call climate science a hoax and denounce environ-mentalists as global warming alarm-ists. They write letters, blast out emails, pressure lawmakers, sponsor seminars, appear on television. They even made a documentary movie. This article in the Washington Post told the story behind this coalition. Obviously, the coalition, this Cooler Heads crowd, is paid for. ‘‘The Cooler Heads have received more than $11 mil-lion in donations over the years from coal and oil companies.’’ Who knew? ‘‘They’ve taken in tens of millions from nonprofit foundations, such as those controlled by the wealthy Koch brothers. . . .’’ Guess what. There is more fossil fuel money. The Koch brothers run a fossil fuel empire. 
The Cooler Heads Coalition . . . are allied with industry trade groups, public relations companies and lobbyists, all of whom are working to influence public debate about global warming. Climate scientists said there is no doubt about the reality of climate change and its consequences, including melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and the intensifica-tion of storms. 
Benjamin Santer is a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Labora-tory. We are pretty proud of our Na-tional Laboratories, and we usually don’t think people who are there are idiots or are fooling us or are part of a hoax. Dr. Santer, by the way, also re-ceived a MacArthur Foundation Genius award. He told the Washington Post that this Cooler Heads outfit is ‘‘at-tempting to turn back the clock on knowledge and science.’’ The history of this is rooted in a complex influence campaign that began in support of tobacco. The to-bacco plan foreshadowed the tactics that Cooler Heads members would soon employ on climate change. First, there were millions in con-tributions from affected industries, often laundered through front groups and through foundations. ‘‘The same array of donors,’’ the Washington Post reports, ‘‘would help finance charities behind’’ the fight against climate science. They took the skills they learned, de-nying the health harms of tobacco, and moved that same technology of propa-ganda, influence, and politicking into climate change. The Competitive En-terprise Institute became the lead group in this Cooler Heads Coalition, taking over management of the coali-tion, joined by groups such as the Heartland Institute. The Heartland In-stitute is really a classy group. They are the ones that put up billboards comparing climate scientists to the Unabomber. That is the quality of de-bate we get out of the Heartland Insti-tute. Americans for Prosperity is another influential nonprofit organization, which is a front for—guess whom—the Koch brothers and Koch Industries; i.e., the fossil fuel industry. They got particularly cranked up by the Kyoto Protocol, and the story continues: The energy industry went on a spending spree to thwart Kyoto, devoting at least $13 million to public relations and information campaigns in 1997. . . . The Cooler Heads Co-alition was in effect a loose confederation of groups with the declared mission of coun-tering ‘‘the myths of global warming.’’ 
In early 1998, this Cooler Heads group met with energy industry executives and lobbyists in closed-door meetings at the American Petroleum Institute and began to soak up more money, and here is what the plan was. I am quoting from the story in the Post. 
One former Cooler Heads member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of a punitive backlash, said the coali-tion’s mission . . . was to . . . simulate a ‘‘cacophony of voices’’ against climate- change science. ‘‘There’s a whole web,’’ the former member said [out to do this]. 
The ExxonMobil Foundation, of course, had given millions to Cooler Heads members. A 2009 IRS filing for the Competitive Enterprise Institute—the group that took over the coalition and managed it—inadvertently made public a filing that disclosed their funding from two coal mining companies, Ohio-based Murray Energy and Richmond-based Massey Energy. ‘‘Contributions to CEI during the Obama administration rose to $7.6 mil-lion in 2014.’’ As the article continues, ‘‘CEI and the Cooler Heads were just the tip of the spear. . . . [B]etween 2003 and 2010, energy companies, corpora-tions and conservative foundations contributed hundreds of millions to 91 nonprofit ‘think tanks,’ educational groups and associations involved in the fight against global-warming regula-tions.’’ To put it mildly, as the expert who chronicled this concluded, ‘‘This is a large-scale political effort.’’ We have one last report from inside that large-scale political effort. This is the firsthand voice of the individual. His name is Jerry Taylor. Here is what he says: 
I used to be the number two person at the Cato Institute. 
The Cato Institute is one of this con-stellation of rightwing groups that fo-ment and support climate denial and receives money from fossil fuel inter-ests. He continues: 
I was responsible for building our resist-ance to climate action. . . . I discovered that a lot of the scientific narratives I was offer-ing were really dodgy. . . . [O]ne of the peo-ple that I trusted the most was in the busi-ness of consciously misrepresenting the de-bate. This really rattled me. 
He goes on. 
[O]nce I started looking closely at a lot of the convenient, plausible talking points I was offering they began to fall apart. [I then turned to look at] economic arguments. He says: 
This is pretty hard. It’s a very difficult thing . . . to find that you cannot trust any of the scientists that are being offered to re-sist climate action. 
This is the guy who used to lead the anti-climate action effort of the Cato Institute, saying it is a very difficult thing to find that you cannot trust any of the scientists who are being offered to resist climate action, and then the economists whom you have been rely-ing on to put cautious remarks about cost-benefit are now all walking away from the game. He goes on to say: 
We got to the point . . . where you could not find an academic economist who studies climate change who argued against climate action—not one single one. 
Here is his conclusion: 
Believe it or not, libertarians and conserv-atives and Republicans were put on this earth with the perfect answer to climate change—harnessing markets and price sig-nals via a carbon tax or a carbon tax-like mechanism to reduce greenhouse gas emis-sion. We’re perfectly placed to do that. [What is it that] keeps Republicans from coming to the conclusion that climate change doesn’t just threaten polar bears in the Arctic, it threatens the global economy, it threatens capital flows, it threatens cap-italism. . . . It’s not the Republican base, let me tell you. 
There is poll after poll, survey after survey showing that most Republicans believe in doing something about cli-mate. He continues: 
What prevents Republican politicians from acting is that there are significant members in the Republican Party Coalition who are denialist demanders. 
They are not just climate deniers themselves, they are denialist demand-ers. 
They have outsized influence in the party. 
He says: 
[T]he Koch-controlled Tea Party move-ment [has] held the GOP by the throat. 
By the way, if you were somebody who was trying to find some comfort in the widely reported phenomenon that 97 percent of climate scientists con-clude the global warming is real and problematic for the planet and has been exacerbated by human activity, if you are comforting yourself that maybe the 3 percent were right, that the really smart place to place your bet for the future of the planet and our economy and our standing in the world is on those 3 percent—not take the 97 percent bet; no, take the 3-percent bet—if that is the way you are think-ing, you got bad news. Researchers tried to replicate the re-sults of those 3 percent of papers. Guess what. They found biased, faulty results. Katharine Hayhoe is an atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech University. She said this: 
Every single one of those analyses had an error—in their assumptions, methodology, or analysis—that, when corrected, brought their results into line with the scientific consensus.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5083 September 7, 2017 
If you are hoping that 3 percent was somehow going to bail you out from having to face this crisis, that just blew up. There is no 3 percent. 
Broadly, there were three main errors in the papers denying climate change. Many had cherry-picked the results . . . some that applied inappropriate ‘‘curve-fitting’’ [to try to step] away from data until the points matched the curve of their choosing. 
This is my favorite. 
Sometimes the papers just ignored physics altogether. 
It has been quite a month with the West ablaze, Houston underwater, the most powerful storm ever measured in the Atlantic is headed our way, heat and rain and other measures breaking records year after year, multiple de-partments of governments aligning to warn us, and how does the Trump Ad-ministration respond? The Energy department asked sci-entists to remove the word ‘‘climate change’’ from a grant proposal. 
I have been asked to contact you to update the wording in your proposal abstract to re-move words such as ‘‘global warming’’ or ‘‘climate change.’’ 
Not just one fluke. In March, POLIT-ICO reported as follows: 
[T]hat staff at the Department of Energy . . . were told not to use the terms ‘‘climate change,’’ ‘‘emissions reduction’’ or ‘‘Paris Agreement.’’ 
The Department put out a power grid study that has been long delayed, and in the power grid study, the words ‘‘cli-mate change’’ never appeared. Wher-ever they were in earlier drafts, they got scrubbed. The only reference to cli-mate is a reference to ‘‘rescinding en-ergy and climate-related policies.’’ The EPA has been scrubbing the word ‘‘climate change’’ from its website. It removed its climate change page and then got hammered with a se-ries of Freedom of Information Act re-quests as to what is going on with that so they quickly scrambled and pub-lished an archived version but buried it back in the website. The Department of Interior has also removed discussions of the effects of global warming from several of its pages. The Department of Agriculture has emails showing how staff in their Natural Resources Conservation Serv-ice was coached by managers to avoid the term ‘‘climate change’’ and instead use other language. That is where we are—all of those facts, the motive behind it, the finger-prints of the fossil fuel industry, the confessions by participants in those schemes. Where are we? In this room, silence. Nobody will talk about it be-cause the power of the fossil fuel indus-try is so strong, the threats are so bloodcurdling that nobody dares. We cannot have a grownup, factual discus-sion about climate change in this building either. Of course, over in the Trump administration, they have com-pletely thrown in the towel to the fos-sil fuel industry, and now we are hop-ing to dodge the problem by forbidding people from using the words ‘‘climate change.’’ It is pathetic. I yield the floor. f

HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 6, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354) making ap-propriations for the Department of the Inte-rior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes: 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chair, as the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Parkinson’s Dis-ease and a member of the Congressional Mul-tiple Sclerosis Caucus, I’m proud of the collec-tive work of the 114th Congress in enacting 21st Century Cures—a bipartisan undertaking to help our healthcare innovation infrastructure thrive and deliver more hope for all patients. Personally, I have family members who have suffered with Parkinson’s—I witness this debilitating disease through them. It’s hard to watch. Few things in America are truly uni-versal—diseases, sadly, are one of those things. Currently, we do not have accurate informa-tion about how many people are living with neurological diseases like Parkinson’s and Multiple Sclerosis, geographic location, or even basic attributes like gender, ethnicity, etc. Lack of accurate information slows critical research while erecting new and reinforcing existing barriers to health care services that these vulnerable patients need. 21st Century Cures addressed this issue by statutorily developing the necessary infrastruc-ture to collect data on neurological diseases so key health stakeholders could better under-stand the patient population, facilitate re-search, and proactively plan for health care needs—saving lives while controlling costs. This infrastructure is the National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System. Information provided by the National Neuro-logical Conditions Surveillance System will provide a foundation for understanding factors, such as clusters of diagnoses in certain geo-graphic regions, variances in the number of men and women diagnosed with neurological diseases, and differences in health care prac-tices among patients. Unfortunately, funds were not appropriated to formally establish this database at CDC. Mr. Chair, I understand that we must prac-tice fiscal discipline and exercise fiscal con-straint. I understand difficult decisions must be made in this appropriation bill. I understand the fiscal environment in which we now find ourselves due to our low budget caps here in the House. However, as the budget caps are higher in the Senate, I ask that should the measure we are considering be put before a conference committee, that funding be made available for the National Neurological Condi-tions Surveillance System so that we can real-ize the mission of 21st Century Cures—to ac-celerate medical product development and bring new innovations and advances to pa-tients who need them faster and more effi-ciently. I hope you will work with me to find funding for this critical system for patients. f

SPEECH OF  
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 6, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354) making ap-propriations for the Department of the Inte-rior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes: 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Amendment No. 66, offered by Representative J
AYAPAL , to strike the $535 million increase for ICE enforcement and in-stead add $30 million to ICE’s Office of the In-spector General and $10 million to DHS’s Of-fice of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. This ad-ditional oversight funding would support inves-tigations of sexual assault in immigration de-tention as mandated by the Prison Rape Elimi-nation Act. The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) was passed in 2003 as a result of a remark-able bipartisan effort led by Congressman Frank Wolf and myself in the House and Sen-ators Jeff Sessions and Ted Kennedy in the Senate. Ten years after passage of PREA, in 2014, DHS finalized regulations to comply with PREA. This year, 2017, is the first in which DHS is instituting those regulations by auditing its facilities for compliance. We must aid DHS in its efforts to investigate and prevent sexual abuse. According to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at DHS, dur-ing the two-year period from May 2014 to July 2016, it received over 1,000 complaints from detainees reporting sexual abuse or assault. The Office of Inspector General investigated only 24 of those complaints—that is 2.4 per-cent of the total complaints that were made by detained immigrants. Immigrant detainees also face barriers to reaching the Inspector General’s telephone hotline for reporting abuse, because, accord-ing to a 2013 report from the Government Ac-countability Office (GAO), approximately 14 percent of calls placed to that hotline did not go through because, for example, the call was not answered. This Amendment is an essential step to giv-ing DHS resources to comply with PREA and protect immigrants from sexual abuse and as-sault in detention facilities. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 SPEECH OF  
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 6, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354) making ap-propriations for the Department of the Inte-rior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes: 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of an amendment I’ve offered to provide the Na-tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) an additional $9 million. The purpose of this amendment is to enable the agency to focus on connected and automated vehicles by expanding its workforce to validate the safety of these transformative vehicles, defin-ing new testing protocols as the technology advances, and to better collaborate with indus-try, and state and local governments to con-duct adequate oversight of their deployment on our roads. Connected and automated vehicles are a rapidly emerging technology with the potential to improve safety and mobility, decrease con-gestion, and increase the overall efficiency of our nation’s transportation network. But along with this progress comes a number of press-ing policy challenges. The federal government can, and must, play a role in maximizing the societal benefits of these technologies. In a time when the technology that enables automated vehicles is rapidly advancing, I firmly believe that we must continue to pro-mote U.S. leadership in this industry, with the goal of full deployment of automated vehicles on our roads and highways. Policies that bal-ance consumer protection while facilitating in-novation will ultimately benefit our manufac-turing and transportation industries and their workers. As Co-Chair of the Unmanned Systems Caucus, I have been holding periodic roundtables around the country on connected and autonomous transportation policy for the past two years. I have listened to experts from O.E.M.s, tier 1 suppliers, infoimation tech-nology companies, transportation planners, and tech start-ups. Part of this interest is from my background as an engineer, and my work as the Ranking Member of the House Science Committee’s Research Subcommittee. Last Congress, I in-troduced the Future TRIP Act to promote auto-mated vehicle research. Key provisions of that bill passed into law in the FAST Act. NHTSA has done an admirable job of work-ing with the industry in developing policy guid-ance while allowing enough flexibility to pro-mote innovation for an industry that is con-stantly evolving. It is exactly this kind of con-sensus-based incremental change that will

their safety on the road. NHTSA needs the ability to review and process vehicle exemp-tions, conduct testing, and review safety standards. Earlier today, we passed H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act, which expanded NHTSA’s authorities in this area. That bill is an impor-tant step toward defining the federal govern-ment’s role in regulating automated vehicles. The bill supports the testing and deployment of automated vehicles through the waiver process, preempts a patchwork of differing state and local regulations to provide certainty to industry and vehicle operators, and ensures consumer confidence by improving safety standards. My amendment provides the initial financial resources needed to carry out the directives authorized in the SELF DRIVE Act, and sub-sequently appropriates the resources to give NHTSA the ability to examine these ongoing challenges. I appreciate the support of Chairman D
IAZ- B
ALART , and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

RECOGNIZING SENIOR DETECTIVE ARLENE CURRIER 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Senior Detective Arlene Currier for nearly a decade and a half of serving and pro-tecting the community in Salinas, California. Detective Currier obtained a law enforce-ment certificate from Gavilan College in Gilroy, California, and continued her education at Ev-ergreen Valley College and San Jose City Col-lege. In 2003, she transitioned from a career in sales and marketing to a position in the Sa-linas Police Department’s Patrol Division. Pa-trolling assigned areas in the city of Salinas, she embraced her role as both an enforcer of the law and as a leader in her community. Of-ficer Currier investigated criminal activity with efficiency, provided assistance and first aid, and fostered a strong relationship with resi-dents. In 2005, as a Field Training Officer, she instructed new recruits in proper procedure, and helped the Salinas Police Department maintain its standard of excellence. As of 2007, Officer Currier became a rob-bery and homicide detective. In this capacity, she took an active part in nearly every aspect of law enforcement—from the crime scene to the courtroom. Detective Currier also served on the board of directors of the Filipino-Amer-ican Law Enforcement Officers Association, an organization dedicated to promoting, ‘‘fraternal relationships and cultural awareness among all law enforcement personnel and the com-munities [they] serve.’’ I stand with the City of Salinas, and the en-tirety of California’s 20th District, in expressing our gratitude for Arlene Currier’s many years of meritorious service. I wish her well in her retirement and future endeavors. RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER ARMY SERGEANT (SGT) MATTHEW LEE INGRAM HON. TRENT KELLY

SGT Ingram was killed when an improvised explosive device detonated near his military vehicle in Kunar Province, Afghani-stan. The blast occurred while his unit was under small arms fire from enemy forces. SGT Ingram was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, Colo-rado. SGT Ingram grew up in eastern Mississippi, where he attended Newton High School. He played wide receiver on the school’s football team. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2003 and completed his basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia. Following basic training, SGT Ingram was assigned to South Korea, where he spent 10 months before his entire brigade was deployed to Iraq from 2004 until 2005. In 2006, SGT Ingram married his wife, Holly, while stationed at Fort Carson, Colo-rado. They had one daughter, Chloe. That same year, SGT Ingram deployed to Iraq for a second tour. In May 2009, SGT Ingram de-ployed to Afghanistan. Mississippi lawmakers recognized SGT Ingram for his service and sacrifice. The Res-olution was adopted by the Senate and the House during the 2010 regular session. It states that, ‘‘SGT Ingram was a loving father, husband and son who is counted among America’s heroes, committed to our nation’s safety and security.’’ It further states that, ‘‘Mississippians understand the costs of con-flict because we have paid them in the past.’’ SGT Ingram’s earned the Purple Heart, Army Commendation medal, Army Achieve-ment medal, two Army Good Conduct medals, National Defense Service medal, Korea De-fense Service medal, Afghanistan Campaign medal with Campaign Star, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary medal, Global War on Terrorism Service medal, and the Combat In-fantry Badge. In 2009, Representative G
REGG HARPER (R– MS) introduced a bill to name the United States Post Office at 7464 Highway 503, Hick-ory, Mississippi in SGT Ingram’s honor. H.R. 4139, the ‘‘Matthew L. Ingram Post Office’’ Designation Act, passed by unanimous con-sent in the House and the Senate and was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. SGT Ingram is survived by his wife, Holly; his daughter, Chloe; his parents, James and Patricia Ingram; and his older brother, Jamie. SGT Ingram’s commitment to protect Amer-ica will always be remembered. CELEBRATING THE ANNUAL SARA-TOGA COUNTY OFFICE FOR THE AGING SENIOR PICNIC HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

RECOGNIZING U.S. ARMY MASTER SERGEANT JOHN DORVAL MINATRA 
HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, there are no greater heroes than our veterans and ac-tive military. In worldwide campaigns, they courageously and selflessly serve and protect our nation from foreign and domestic threats. Their efforts have never failed us. Today, I would like to recognize and honor U.S. Army Master Sergeant John Dorval Minatra for his extraordinary heroism and ex-ceptional valor in operations during Indo China, Korea, and Vietnam warfare. In the Re-public of Vietnam, he was cited several times for valor in combat with U.S. and Vietnamese awards—most notably the Purple Heart, Dis-tinguished Service Cross, and three Bronze Stars. For his Ranger spirit in three voluntary tours of duty, three assignments training the Vietnamese Battalion with the Mountain Rang-er Committee, service as Ranger Advisor to the Vietnamese Airborne Battalion, and third voluntary tour with the IV Corps HQ, he re-ceived the Ranger Hall of Fame medallion—a validation of ‘‘Rangers Lead the Way.’’ MSG Minatra’s tactical knowledge, initiative, high standards, and unswerving desire to train and produce the best possible warrior made him an inspirational model for Rangers. His ability to rally and direct soldiers under fire, while wounded, reflects great credit upon him-self, his unit, and the U.S. Army. Leadership is not as it appears, but as it performs. We join his children Barry, Larry and Melissa, nine grandchildren and 11 great- grandchildren in gratitude for his guidance, heroism, and devotion through 20 years of military service.

RECOGNIZING HENSEL PHELPS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize Hensel Phelps Construction Company for receiving the 2017 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. This pres-tigious award is given to only a handful of firms out of over 3,000 applicants in order to recognize their support of National Guard and Reserve employees. This is truly a remarkable achievement that speaks to Hensel Phelps’ care for our service members. Hensel Phelps is a thriving, international corporation that was founded in Greeley, Colo-rado in 1937. Over the last 80 years, this com-pany has grown from a local commercial con-struction company to the prosperous inter-national business it is today. They have cre-ated thousands of jobs and have made nota-ble contributions to improve the communities around their operations, as well as their em-ployees’ livelihoods. Hensel Phelps is an excellent example of what enterprising and forward thinking busi-nesses can accomplish in America’s great economy. As a former executive there, I have experienced firsthand what a remarkable com-pany it is. The skills I learned and experiences I had while at Hensel Phelps still help me to this day as I work to represent the people of Colorado’s fourth district. The care given to their staff is exceptional, and they should be commended for their innovative spirit, em-ployee ownership model, and commitment to supporting our troops. Hensel Phelps’ inspiring success confirms that the American Dream is alive and thriving in Colorado and the United States. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Hensel Phelps Construction Company for re-ceiving the 2017 Secretary of Defense Em-ployer Support Freedom Award. f

RECOGNIZING SERGEANT JOHN D. LYNN HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sergeant John D. Lynn of the Sali-nas Police Department for over 25 years of dedication to the residents of the city of Sali-nas. After leaving active duty in the U.S. Army at Fort Ord, John Lynn opted to serve his com-munity by entering an officer training program for law enforcement in 1990. Upon completion, he was assigned as a patrol officer in the city of Salinas, California. In 1993 he became a D.A.R.E instructor, educating the students in Salinas High School and Washington Middle School about the dangers of drug abuse. Over the ensuing years, as a community service re-source office, Officer Lynn coordinated neigh-borhood watch meetings and organized crime prevention presentations. Sergeant Lynn also conducted the Salinas Police Department’s first ever National Night Out event, in which neighbors and police convene for a night of community conversation, casual dining and community festivities. In 2000, Sergeant Lynn became a traffic motorcycle officer, tasked with leading major traffic collision investigations. Over the years, he was promoted to sergeant, served with var-ious capacities in the Salinas Police Depart-ment, including the personnel and training unit, patrol, supervision of the traffic unit, inter-nal affairs, and a role coordinating a DUI en-forcement campaign. In a dramatic episode in November 2015, Sergeant Lynn and two fellow officers suc-cessfully prevented an attempted suicide by hanging of a man. He is a hero and was hon-ored as Monterey County Officer of the Year. For the past six years, Sergeant Lynn has been the S.P.D representative for the Special Olympics of Northern California. Only a few weeks ago, a golden torch passed through Salinas, escorted by several local officers, an event that raised more than $13,000 for the program. It is yet another example of Sergeant John Lynn’s dedication to this community. On behalf of California’s 20th District, I thank him for his many years of service, and I wish him the best of luck in his well-earned retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF HARRY MESHEL

OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of Harry Meshel who died on September 4, 2017. Mr. Meshel was a native of Youngstown, Ohio and ‘‘known for his re-markable civic, cultural, and educational con-tributions to the community. Well-known for his colorful stories, sharp wit, and keen memory, Meshel had a success-ful political career in the Ohio Democratic Party. Throughout his career, he had the op-portunity to meet iconic political leaders, in-cluding President John F. Kennedy and Presi-dent Lyndon B. Johnson. Meshel’s break came in late 1963 when Youngstown Mayor- elect Anthony B. Flask selected him to be his administrative assistant. Meshel served in that capacity for more than five years. When a seat in the Ohio Senate opened, Meshel won a seven-person Democratic primary in 1970 and then the general election. He spent more than 22 years in the Ohio Senate, and the ma-jority of that time was spent in leadership posi-tions, including president for two years. After resigning from the Senate in 1993, Meshel served as state Democratic party chairman. He later went on to serve a nine-year term as a trustee on the board of Youngstown State University.’’ Harry was one of the original sponsors of legislation to establish the Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED) in Rootstown. Additionally, he was instrumental in the cre-ation of the Ohio University College of Osteo-pathic Medicine and the Wright State Univer-sity School of Professional Psychology. He was a relentless advocate of Youngtown State University as a student, a legislator, and as a Trustee. In addition to all the achievements of this able leader, I remember Harry as a Greek American who valiantly fought our nation’s battle at Leyte Gulf in the Philippines. He was a dedicated supporter of our veterans and a frequent participant at many veterans’ events. Harry was a respected and beloved member of the community who influenced countless lives. He was a dear friend and mentor to me when I was just starting out my career in pub-lic service. His legacy is represented all over the Mahoning Valley and Youngstown State University. He will be deeply missed by our community and by all of those fortunate enough to know him. I extend my deepest condolences to his family and friends. f

held the school record in the 4X100 meter for six years. CPT Miller graduated from high school in 1988. In 1993, CPT Miller graduated from Virginia Military Institute where he earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He was commissioned Second Lieutenant upon graduation and was transferred to the Michigan Army National Guard. In January 2005, CPT Miller volunteered with the 1–155th Infantry Regiment, McComb, Mississippi in order to deploy to Iraq. At the time of his de-ployment, CPT Miller was employed as an electrical engineer for Yazaki North America, Inc. CPT Miller’s father, Lowell Thomas, wrote about his son’s death on a memorial website. ‘‘It was a night mission that they said was too dangerous for American soldiers and they called on the group of Iraqi soldiers he had been training for six weeks,’’ Mr Miller wrote. ‘‘He didn’t want them to go alone, so he went with them. He was a soldier’s soldier. He al-ways took care of his men and never gave a thought for his own safety.’’ CPT Miller was remembered by a fellow sol-dier on a memorial website. ‘‘My brother in arms, you were more than just an officer, more than just a soldier, and more than just a leader,’’ Specialist (SPC) Rickland L. Scholz, II wrote. ‘‘You were a true friend. I will never for-get the missions we had been on together nor the long conversations and sound advice that you have given me. You will never be forgot-ten and I will always remember the time in Egypt that we were able to have long discus-sions. Rest in peace now, my fallen brother.’’ During the funeral service, at the Swartz Fu-neral Home in Flint, Michigan, Eric Leszczynski, CPT Miller’s supervisor at Yazaki North America, Inc., said he was a man who knew how to get his coworkers motivated. ‘‘If you gave him something to do, it would get done,’’ Leszczynski said. In September 2005, family and friends at-tended the burial service at the Arlington Na-tional Cemetery Columbarium Complex in Ar-lington, Virginia. During the service, an honor guard held an American flag over the urn con-taining CPT Miller’s ashes. A folded flag was presented to his wife, Angela. CPT Miller is survived by his wife, Angela; his daughters, Danielle and Alexandra; his sib-lings, Patrick and Jennie; and his parents, Lowell and Linda Miller. CPT Miller’s commitment to protect America earned him the Bronze Star medal, the Purple Heart medal, the National Defense Service medal, and the Armed Forces Expeditionary medal. His sacrifice will not be forgotten.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Kenneth K. Lee, a combat- injured Operation Iraqi Freedom and Army vet-eran, who has been named by Disabled Amer-ican Veterans (DAV) as its 2017 Outstanding Disabled Veteran of the Year. Dr. Lee, who deployed as the commander of the Army’s Company B, 118th Area Support Medical Battalion, was injured in November 2004 by a suicide car bomber in Iraq. The ex-plosion resulted in an open head traumatic brain injury and severe shrapnel wounds to his legs, leading to his evacuation back to the states, where he would later be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. While recovering from his injuries, Dr. Lee, a rehabilitation specialist, saw how long and difficult recovery could be, often leaving lasting changes. Dr. Lee, who resides in Brookfield, Wisconsin, is a volunteer physician at the Na-tional Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic, which the Department of Veterans Affairs and DAV co-host, so he was no stranger to using adaptive sports as therapy. Through his own recovery, Dr. Lee propelled himself into the world of adaptive sports to help him deal with the psychological and physiological effects that can often times cause an individual to hit bottom. Within a year of Dr. Lee’s retirement in 2013, he formed the Milwaukee Wheelchair Lacrosse team and is now the president of the Wisconsin Adaptive Sports Association, which runs numerous adaptive sports programs. On July 29, 2017, DAV National Com-mander David W. Riley presented Dr. Lee with the Outstanding Disabled Veteran of the Year award at the organization’s 96th National Con-vention. In his statement, Riley praised Dr. Lee as a shining example of everything that is good about our nation and its veterans. He noted that the compassion Dr. Lee shows for other veterans and his work to help them find suc-cess is truly the hallmark of the award, and DAV is very proud of what he’s doing for this community. Given the importance and thera-peutic effectiveness of adaptive sports, it is vital to have experienced leaders like Dr. Lee involved and carving out a path forward. Despite his injuries and the constant pain in his lower extremities, Dr. Lee speaks with gratitude about his time in the Army. He will tell you that he got a lot more from the Guard than he put into it, and that he joined the mili-tary with his eyes wide open and has no re-grets. Dr. Lee and his wife Kate currently live in Brookfield with their two children. In 2014, his daughter Leah earned a $10,000 scholarship by volunteering for the DAV at the Milwaukee VA Medical Center. On the same day that Dr. Lee was honored as DAV’s Outstanding Dis-abled Veteran of the Year, his son Jonathan earned the charity’s largest scholarship of $20,000, and was honored the same morning. They both hope ultimately to serve veterans as physicians through the VA. f 
RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND SACRIFICE MADE BY MARINE CORPORAL DAVID SONKA 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the service and sacrifice made by Ma-rine Corporal David Sonka. Corporal David Sonka was a devoted son, husband, and Marine. He grew up in Parker, Colorado and knew at a young age he wanted to serve his country. Corporal Sonka enlisted in the United States Marine Corps immediately following his high school graduation in 2008. He completed Military Police school, K9 School, and in 2012 was selected to become a dog handler for the Marine Special Oper-ations Command (MARSOC) at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina where he was paired with his faithful canine companion, Flex. On March 31, 2013, Corporal Sonka and Flex were deployed with Marine Special Oper-ations Team 8223 to Farah Province, Afghani-stan. While on watch during a meeting be-tween Afghan military personnel and Marine Special Operations Forces on May 4, 2013, an Afghan soldier opened fire and fatally injured both Corporal Sonka and Flex. Corporal Sonka has since been recognized for his brav-ery and sacrifice. He received a Combat Ac-tion Ribbon, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, the Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and the Purple Heart. Additionally, the town of Parker, Colorado named their dog park after Corporal Sonka as did the MARSOC K9 Train-ing Facility in Camp Lejeune. Our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude than the one we owe our veterans. It is the heroic bravery and incredible sacrifices made by individuals like Corporal Sonka that have helped secure the freedoms that we as Ameri-cans hold dear. On behalf of the 4th Congres-sional District of Colorado, I extend my deep-est gratitude to Corporal Sonka for his service and sacrifice for our nation. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Ma-rine Corporal David Sonka for his sacrifice in defending the United States of America. f 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN SOLDIER ARMY SPECIALIST (SPC) BRIAN KEITH DERKS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Army Specialist (SPC) Brian Keith Derks who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our great nation on August 13, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Free-dom. SPC Derks was killed when an impro-vised explosive device detonated while he was on mounted patrol in Baghdad. SPC Derks was assigned to the 2nd Squadron, 11th Ar-mored Cavalry Regiment, Fort Irwin, Cali-fornia, which was attached to the 155th Ar-mored Brigade Combat Team from Mis-sissippi. SPC Derks, a White Cloud, Michigan native, graduated from White Cloud High School in 2003. According to the Associated Press, SPC Derks was the captain of the Quiz Bowl Team and was credited for bringing the team to a national competition. Tony McHattie, one of SPC Derks’ high school teachers, said he had an astute mind. ‘‘Consistently, Brian would buzz in before a question was even half done,’’ McHattie said. ‘‘He just had vast knowl-edge in all sorts of areas.’’ According to the memorial website FindAGrave.com, SPC Derks played football and baseball in high school. SPC Derks was an active member of the White Cloud Boy Scouts Troop #1137. He became an Eagle Scout and briefly served as an assistant scoutmaster. SPC Derks enjoyed hunting, fish-ing, computers, and spending time with his family. SPC Derks’ sense of humor always kept people laughing.

SPC Derks was determined to join the Army, so in order to meet the weight require-ments, he worked to lose 100 pounds. Captain (CPT) Jarrod P. Wickline, an Army recruiter, said SPC Derks accomplished his goal. ‘‘He took that as a personal challenge,’’ CPT Wickline said. ‘‘He lost the weight in three months. There is no doubt to me that by sheer willpower alone, he would be anything he wanted to be.’’ The memorial service was held at First Christian Reformed Church in Fremont, Michi-gan. SPC Derks was laid to rest at White Cloud Cemetery. SPC Derks was awarded the Purple Heart, the Good Conduct medal, the National De-fense Service medal, the Global War on Ter-rorism Expeditionary medal, the Global War on Terrorism medal, the Army Service Ribbon, and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge. SPC Derks is survived by his parents, Keith and Peggy Derks; sister, Sally Derks; maternal grandparents, Emery and Ester Wilson; pater-nal grandparents, Vernon and Evelyn Derks; and fiance´e, Nikki Crans. SPC Derks’ sacrifice to protect the freedoms we all enjoy will not be forgotten.

IN RECOGNITION OF RAIL SAFETY MONTH AND RAIL SAFETY WEEK 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as Rail Safety Month and September 24–30, 2017 as Rail Safety week, and to commend the efforts being made across our country to improve railroad cross-ing safety. An accident involving a train occurs every 3 hours in the United States and California ranks No. 1 in the nation in both trespassing and grade crossing deaths. Last year in Cali-fornia there were a total of 148 highway grade-crossing incidents, including 98 tres-passer fatalities and 32 highway-rail crossing fatalities, all of which could have been avoided if both trespassers and drivers were taking the necessary safety precautions. There are more than 10,000 highway rail-grade crossings lo-cated within 52 counties and more than 400 cities in California to service the BNSF Rail-way, Union Pacific Railroad, other freight trains, and Amtrak passenger trains running through California. September is historically back to school month for most children and college students. Many must cross railroad tracks to attend school and it is important to reinforce rail safe-ty with both children and their caretakers. Cali-fornia Operation Lifesaver, the Federal Rail Administration, the California Department of Transportation, the California Public Utilities Commission and freight and passenger rail-roads are working together to improve railroad safety and educate children and adults about the dangers of not obeying the signs and sig-nals around railroad property. The ‘‘See Tracks? Think Train’’ campaign by Operation Lifesaver and its federal partners aims to help reduce pedestrian and driver injuries and fatahties around railroad tracks by highlighting behaviors that put people at risk, and by con-ducting on-the-ground law enforcement trainings, safety presentations, and public awareness activities. Railroad operators, motor vehicle operators, and pedestrians will benefit from a combined effort by local, state, Federal, industry, and citizen efforts to pro-mote safety around railroad tracks and cross-ings. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize September as Rail Safety Month and Sep-tember 24–30, 2017 as Rail Safety week. I ask all my colleagues to join me in com-mending efforts being made to improve rail-road crossing safety. f

EBOSE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of fallen Mississippi soldier Army Master Sergeant (MSG) Coater Bernard DeBose. MSG DeBose gave his life while in service to our great nation on August 19, 2008, during Operation Enduring Freedom. MSG DeBose died in Spin Boldak, Afghani-stan, of wounds he received from small arms fire while conducting security force assistance operations. MSG DeBose was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 351st Infantry Regiment, 158th Infantry Brigade, First Army Division East, Camp Shelby, Mississippi. MSG DeBose was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart medals. According to the Associated Press, MSG DeBose, a State Line, Mississippi native, joined the Alabama National Guard in May 1983. He transferred to the Army Reserves in 2008. He was deployed in April 2004 to Af-ghanistan, where he served as a communica-tions specialist. It was his job to train Afghan police in the Kandahar region. There have been many memorials posted in MSG DeBose’s honor on Legacy.com, includ-ing one that appeared on September 1, 2012 from Master Sergeant (MSG) Maranda McCorvey. ‘‘As I sign this guest book, no words can explain the loss of a true soldier,’’ MSG McCorvey said. ‘‘He was a leader, men-tor, motivator, and trainer to many lives in and out of the uniform.’’ Rebecca Lewis of Moss Point wrote, ‘‘May God continue to watch over you and your fam-ily at this time,’’ Mrs. Lewis said. ‘‘Deacon DeBose will certainly be missed by all of us in-cluding his Greater First Baptist Church in Escatawpa, Mississippi, under the leadership of Richard Young. Deacon DeBose was a great man and touched many hearts.’’ Christopher DeBose, MSG DeBose’s son, wrote about the pain of losing his father in an August 30, 2012. ‘‘I pray that there is a mili-tary up in heaven,’’ Christopher said. ‘‘I know Master Sergeant DeBose would be in charge of something. No matter what it is, I’m sure God will trust you with any task because he knows you will get it done.’’ Caronica DeBose-Jackson, MSG DeBose’s daughter, paid tribute to her father in a Sep-tember 6, 2012 post. ‘‘I hear your voice telling me to keep moving and live life to the fullest,’’ Caronica said. ‘‘I will go on because that’s what you would want. I will honor your life and legacy forever.’’ MSG DeBose is survived by his wife, Jua-nita, his three sons, Latravis DeBose, Chris-topher DeBose, and Broderick DeBose; and two daughters, Caronica DeBose-Jackson, and Nekeshia Raybon. MSG DeBose demonstrated the qualities of an American hero. His 27 years of military service will always be remembered. f

Judge Apostolou was a widely respected member of the local legal community and well- known in the Roanoke Valley as a ‘‘law-and- order judge.’’ He was loved by the bar be-cause he was a lawyer’s judge, one who would help a young lawyer learn the craft of practicing in the courtroom, and was always fair to everyone who came before him, wheth-er they were represented by a lawyer or not. Following his graduation from the College of William and Mary and the Marshall-Wythe School of Law, he worked in a private law practice and later worked as an assistant com-monwealth’s attorney in Roanoke. He also served as acting judge of the Juvenile and Do-mestic Relations Court on two occasions dur-ing the 1960s. In 1985, he began full-time service as a General District Court judge in

We offer our condolences to his wife of 43 years, Brenda, as well as their chil-dren, Cynthia, Laura, and Jay, and four grand-children. Our prayers are with the Apostolou family as they mourn this loss. May God give them comfort and peace.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF CIVIL-IAN CONTRACTOR CARL T. CAR-ROLL 
HON. TRENT KELLY

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of fallen civilian con-tractor Carl T. Carroll who gave his life while in service to our great nation on August 20, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Mr. Carroll died from injuries he suffered during a roadside attack in Iraq. Mr. Carroll was in Iraq for six months working for the Titan Corpora-tion, where he was the Kalsu Site Manager with the linguist operation. Through his obit-uary, Mr. Carroll, a U.S. Army Veteran, was remembered by his colleagues at Titan as a man of conviction, character, and integrity. Mr. Carroll retired in 2000 from Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania as a helicopter pilot instructor, earning the rank of Chief War-rant Officer 4. He worked as a helicopter pilot for Geisinger Medical Center, Danville until he joined the Titan Corporation. Mr. Carroll was a member of the Williamstown United Methodist Church, life member of the American Legion, and a life member of the National Rifle Association (NRA). He also served as a volunteer with the Williamstown Ambulance Association in Williamstown, Pennsylvania. The Dimon Funeral Home’s online condo-lences page included a comment from a former coworker. ‘‘I was impressed with Carl as a true gentleman the very first time we met,’’ Robert Humphries wrote. ‘‘Even for those of us who knew Carl for only a short time, his passing leaves us all at a loss.’’ Mr. Carroll was also remembered in a post written by a fellow veteran. ‘‘I knew Carl for a short time as we served together at the Eastern Army National Guard Training site,’’ retired Master Sergeant (MSG) Robert Humphries wrote. ‘‘I knew him to be a man of strong moral conviction and dedication to not only duty, but to his fellow man.’’ Mr. Carroll was buried with full military hon-ors at Williamstown Methodist Cemetery in Williamstown, Pennsylvania. Mr. Carroll is survived by his wife, Karen L. Hay Carroll; his daughter, Brandy M. Carroll- Duncannon; his two sons, Jason Carroll, and Justin R.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Tom Wagner as he retires after 15 years supervising the White Mountain National Forest and nearly four dec-ades with the United States Forest Service. We are grateful for his dedication to protecting one of New Hampshire’s most prized assets: the White Mountains. Through his excellent stewardship of over three-quarters of a million acres that comprise the forest, he has ensured that all will continue to be able to enjoy this national treasure. In so doing, he also im-proved the lives of thousands in the Granite State who rely on the White Mountains for both their livelihoods and recreation. I want to applaud Tom for his leadership and advocacy. Dunng his tenure, Tom oversaw the acquisition of 15,000 acres to the White Mountain National Forest and brought numerous stakeholders together to update the long-term strategic plan for the forest. He has been an invaluable resource, and his contin-uous commitment to New Hampshire’s iconic and precious environment is truly inspiring. On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-shire’s Second Congressional District, I thank Tom for his many years of dedicated service to the Granite State. His achievements will continue to benefit our state and its incredible natural landscape. I am honored to recognize and congratulate Tom on his retirement and wish him the best of luck in the years ahead.

HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of fallen Mississippi soldier Army Specialist (SPC) Joshua Isaac Bunch who gave his life while in service to our great nation on August 6, 2004, during Oper-ation Iraqi Freedom. SPC Bunch was killed when Iraqi insurgents firing small arms and rocket-propelled grenades ambushed the Humvee he was riding in near Baghdad.

He graduated from North Forrest High School in 1999. He decided to join the U.S. Army in 2001. He was deployed to Iraq in 2004. Mrs. Bunch said her son wanted to serve in the Army because he wanted to do his part. ‘‘I’m very proud,’’ Mrs Bunch said. ‘‘I’m proud he did what was in his heart to do.’’ Mr. Bunch said his son was a genuine person who was known for his kindness. ‘‘He had a good per-sonality,’’ Mr. Bunch said. ‘‘He would do any-thing for you.’’ At the time of SPC Bunch’s death, Johnny Dupree was the mayor of Hattiesburg. Accord-ing to the Associated Press, when he learned of the soldier’s death, he ordered flags low-ered to half staff at city buildings. Mayor Dupree also called for a day of mourning.

LOCAL POLICE HEROES 
HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the heroism of six local law enforcement officers, who self-lessly risked life and limb to protect their fellow citizens. On Monday, June 22, 2015, a number of Pittsburgh police officers were dispatched on a call for shots fired shortly after 10 a.m. near the intersection of Knox Avenue and Orchard Place in the City of Pittsburgh’s Knoxville neighborhood. As the units were responding, calls came in reporting that this was an ‘‘active shooter’’ in-cident and the suspect was firing an AR–15- style semi-automatic rifle. The suspect moved around the neighborhood, shooting a male taxi driver on Rentz Way, firing shots at vehicles and into occupied homes near a children’s day care facility, and carjacking a white Buick from Rochelle Street. As the reports continued to come in, all available units responded to the area in search of the suspect, with reports that the suspect had driven towards Brownsville Road. Sergeant Kevin Faulds of the Allegheny County Sheriffs Office responded to the call for all available units. Turning onto Brownsville Road from Knox Avenue, he spotted the Buick on Brownsville Road and did a u-turn to pur-sue. As he made the u-turn, the suspect stopped his vehicle and fired his assault rifle from within the car, striking Sergeant Faulds’ vehicle multiple times. Sergeant Faulds took cover and radioed in his situation. When the suspect began driving again, Sergeant Faulds again followed him. The suspect again stopped his vehicle and started shooting. One round went through the top of the windshield on the passenger side of the cruiser. The car’s visor and windshield frame deflected the bullet down and towards Sergeant Faulds, ripping through the headrest of his seat inches from his head and shattering the back window. Ser-geant Faulds maneuvered his patrol car be-hind a bus for protection. When the suspect stopped shooting and drove away, Sergeant Faulds pulled out and followed the suspect at a distance of 50 to 100 feet, all the while con-tinuing to call in information on the suspect’s location and his own.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1180 September 7, 2017 
Officer Joseph DelSole of the Port Authority Police Department heard radio calls regarding an active shooter in a stolen vehicle in the Knoxville Area. Based on Sergeant Faulds’ re-port on his location, Officer DelSole, working the South Zone of the Port Authority service area, proceeded from the South Busway and took up a firing position on Route 51. At the same time, City of Pittsburgh Police Sergeant James Vogel stopped traffic on Route 51, trapping the suspect in the traffic jam. Then, Sergeant Vogel made his way on foot through the stopped vehicles and con-fronted the suspect, who was still sitting in the stolen car. The suspect fired at him using the semi-automatic rifle. City of Pittsburgh Detectives William Friburger and David Honick, along with City of Pittsburgh Sergeant Anthony Palermo ap-proached the suspect’s vehicle on foot. Officer DelSole, Sergeant Vogel, Detectives Friburger and Honick, and Sergeant Palermo fired at the vehicle in order to neutralize the suspect, who was firing at them. The officers and suspect continued to exchange shots from close range until the suspect was hit and succumbed to his injuries. Mr. Speaker, I think we can all appreciate the courage and dedication it takes to con-sciously place oneself in danger by entering a hostile gunman’s field of fire. Not one, not two, but six law enforcement officers in our county did so that day, and continued to risk their lives until the gunman posed no further threat to the community. I can’t begin to express my deep respect and admiration for these brave law enforcement officers or my gratitude to them for their exemplary actions that day. I also want to point out that they, like all of our first responders, go to work each day not knowing what challenges they will face or what risks they will run. The fact that they get up and go to work every day despite the risks inherent in the job speaks volumes about the depth of the commitment they have to pro-tecting their community. They are outstanding public servants, and they deserve recognition here in our Nation’s Capital. I’m very proud of Sergeant Faulds, Officer DelSole, Sergeant Vogel, Detective Friburger, Detective Honick, and Sergeant Palermo, and I want my colleagues and the Nation to take comfort in the knowledge that real heroes still live among us. I hope their actions that day will be an inspiration to all of us to always do what’s right, no matter what the cost.

HONORING LT. T. JAMES CROTTY, USCG 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and heroism of Lt. Thomas J. Crotty of the United States Coast Guard. A decorated veteran of the Second World War, Lt. Crotty will finally be laid to rest in the hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery, 75 years after going missing in ac-tion in the Pacific Theater. Lt. Crotty was born in Buffalo, New York in the year 1912, and grew up on the city’s South Side. The youngest of seven siblings, Crotty stood out as a natural athlete and lead-er. In 1929, he coached his American Legion baseball team to a national championship. After graduating high school, Crotty applied to the United States Coast Guard Academy. A standout cadet, Crotty excelled at basketball, football, and served as class president during his tenure. In 2014, the United States Coast Guard Academy honored Lt. Crotty’s legacy by dedicating their football season to his mem-ory. Upon graduation in 1934, Lt. Crotty went into active duty with the United States Coast Guard, quickly demonstrating his leadership capabilities and skills. He became the Coast Guard’s leading expert on demolition, explo-sives, and mines. In 1941, his unique skillset earned him orders to report to the Philippines to assist with defensive efforts, a decision that would put Lt. Crotty on a crash course with history. On December 10th, Japanese forces overran the Philippines just days after their surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Under brutal assault from air and land, Lt. Crotty helped as-semble a resistance with his fellow service-men. Together, they launched daring raids in broad daylight against Japanese forces in order to secure supplies, ammunition, and fuel. His rag-tag band of heroes was instru-mental in the defense of Manilla, Corregidor, and American supply lines. At the Battle of Bataan, Lt. Crotty served with distinction. Manning the artillery against oncoming forces, he fought until American forces were eventually surrounded on April 9th, 1942. From there, Lt. Crotty was made a prisoner of war in the infamous Cambatuan prison camp. It was there, after so many months of sacrifice, that he tragically fell ill to disease. On July 19, 1942, his brothers-in- arms administered last rites. He was then bur-ied outside the camp; it was there in an un-marked grave that his remains laid for three- quarters of a century. In coordination with the United States Coast Guard, we were able to locate Lt. Crotty and bring him back home to the United States. Lt. Crotty exemplified the qualities and virtues of heroism and service. His service need not be forgotten. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to honor Lt. Thom-as J. Crotty and help bring his family some amount of closure. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring and remembering the countless American men and women who an-swered the call to duty. We must do whatever we can to support families who have loved ones missing in action by assisting in efforts to bring our heroes home. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to mourn the loss and celebrate the life of my dear friend and colleague, Dr Andrew C. Tuttle. I met Andy upon my arrival at UNLV where he served as member and chair of the Political Science Department from 1968 until his retire-ment in 2008. Dr. Tuttle was a beloved teach-er, a respected scholar, and a valued col-league. He was a specialist in national secu-rity policy and was often sought out by policy makers and the press alike for his analysis of world events. He had a great Irish sense of humor and was a loyal and loving family man, who put his wife Helen and sons Mark and Matt above all else. I will miss his wise coun-sel and that twinkle in his eye.

during Operation Enduring Freedom. SPC Horne died in Bagram, Afghanistan. SPC Horne was assigned to the 96th Aviation Sup-port Battalion, 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), Fort Campbell, Kentucky. According to the Associated Press, SPC Horne always made good grades in school. She ranked third in the Greenville High School graduating class of 2010. Percy Powell, one of SPC Horne’s teachers, said she was an im-peccable student throughout high school. ‘‘Ev-erything she wanted to do, she wanted to do it perfect.’’ SPC Horne enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2009. She was stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky prior to her deploying. SPC Horne served as a human resource specialist. It was her job to make sure soldiers’ records were accurately maintained and updated. SPC Horne planned to attend college after com-pleting her second tour of duty with hopes of becoming a physician. Betty Horne, SPC Horne’s mother, said her daughter was intelligent and driven. ‘‘She was a very smart, knowledgeable lady,’’ Mrs. Horne said. ‘‘I am so proud of her.’’ Sydney Horne, one of her brothers, said SPC Horne was the big sister every brother should have. ‘‘She was an outgoing person,’’ Sydney Horne said. ‘‘She loved children. She loved me a lot.’’ Carolyn McAdams, mayor of Greenwood, expressed remorse over the loss of the 20- year-old soldier. ‘‘You know the war is going on, but until something like this happens, it hits home dramatically,’’ Mayor McAdams said. When SPC Horne’s body arrived at the Greenwood-Leflore Airport, more than 200 people came to pay their respects. SPC Horne’s flag-draped casket was met by an Army Honor Guard. Terry Fields, a U.S. Army veteran from Greenwood, came to support a fallen comrade. ‘‘It’s an honor to honor some-body that gave the ultimate sacrifice so that we can enjoy the freedoms that we have today,’’ Mr Fields said. Members of the Patriot Guard led the procession from the airport to the Century Funeral Home. The funeral service for SPC Horne was held at the Providence Missionary Baptist Church in Greenwood. Reverend Robert Williams Jr, pastor of the Community Baptist Church, said SPC Horne had a higher calling than serving our country. ‘‘Patricia has fulfilled her purpose. Now, she’s gone home,’’ Rev. Williams said. ‘‘Her purpose was to be a good soldier in the Lord’s army.’’ Brigadier General (BG) William B. Hickman, the division’s deputy commander, praised SPC Horne’s commitment to the Army. He said SPC Horne was an exemplary soldier who embraced the Army’s values of duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and courage. SPC Horne received the Army Commendation medal, the Army Good Con-duct medal, and the NATO International Secu-rity Assistance Force medal. SPC Horne was buried with full military hon-ors at Hudson Park Cemetery in Greenwood. SPC Horne is survived by her mother, Betty L. Horne, her three sisters, Aleisha Horne, Chaileta B. Horne, and Angelique Willis; and her two brothers, Ronald A. Horne and Syd-ney J. Horne. SPC Horne’s commitment to protect our na-tion will not be forgotten. IN RECOGNITION OF THE INVES-TITURE OF JUDGE MARIAM SAAD BAZZI 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mariam Saad Bazzi on her investiture as Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Wayne County. Judge Bazzi has served Wayne County and southeast Michigan with distinc-tion and honor throughout her involvement in community organizations and previous judici-ary service. After graduating from Wayne State Univer-sity Law School in 2005, Judge Bazzi began her legal career as a law clerk at the Law Of-fices of Hamood, Runco & Fergestrom. A year later, she was hired at the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office, where she most recently served as the lead attorney on the Deed and Mortgage Fraud Task Force. During her 11 year tenure at the Prosecutor’s Office, Judge Bazzi also oversaw a unit that prosecutes fi-nancial crime, with a focus on complex mort-gage and property related fraud, and earned respect for her commitment to the law and to the southeastern Michigan community. Her work as an assistant prosecuting attorney brought her years of experience in complex and diverse parts of the law as well as a re-spect and deep understanding of the role of the judiciary. Judge Bazzi has also distinguished herself through her outstanding record of community service. She served as president of the Dear-born Board of Education and chair of Henry Ford College’s Board of Trustees until Gov-ernor Snyder appointed her as Wayne County Circuit judge, where her leadership was inte-gral to the district’s high graduation rates and top national ranking. Additionally, Judge Bazzi is a member of the Michigan Middle Eastern Affairs Commission, the Governor’s Environ-mental Justice Task Force, and the Arab American Political Action Committee. Judge Bazzi has been an impactful leader and in-volved citizen, and it is my hope that she con-tinues to build on her success and involve-ment in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Judge Mariam Bazzi for her ap-pointment to Wayne County’s Third Circuit Court. Her commitment to the rule of law and exemplary service to Wayne County will surely continue in her new role.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN MISSISSIPPI ARMY NA-TIONAL GUARD SOLDIER FIRST LIEUTENANT (1LT) MATTHEW RYAN STOVALL 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Mississippi Army Na-tional Guard soldier First Lieutenant (1LT) Matthew Ryan Stovall who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our great nation on August 22, 2004, during Operation Iraqi Free-dom. According to the Associated Press, 1LT Stovall was killed when an improvised explo-sive device detonated near the vehicle he was riding in. At the time of his death, 1LT Stovall was taking part in a humanitarian aid and con-voy mission in Mosul, Iraq. 1LT Stovall was assigned to the 367th Maintenance Company, 298th Corps Support Battalion, Mississippi Army National Guard, Philadelphia, Mis-sissippi. 1LT Stovall joined the Mississippi Army Na-tional Guard prior to his 1997 graduation from Neshoba Central High School. He completed Officer Candidate School in 2001 and later completed the Officer Basic Course in Fort Eustis, Virginia in 2002. That same year, 1LT Stovall married his wife, Natalie. Together they had one son, Walker Stovall. In September 2003, 1LT Stovall deployed to Mosul, Iraq. While in Mosul, he was chosen to lead the 1st Platoon of the 401st Transpor-tation Company, known as the ‘‘A Team.’’ Dur-ing his deployment, 1LT Stovall stayed in con-tact with his cousin, Robin McClellan, a teach-er at Philadelphia Elementary School. He reg-ularly communicated through e-mails with the students in her fifth grade class. The students would get excited every time his e-mails were read aloud to them. Two months before 1LT Stovall was to re-turn home from Iraq, he was fatally wounded. According to the Associated Press, approxi-mately 500 people attended the memorial service held at McClain-Hayes Funeral Home. Mississippi National Guard Major General (MG) Harold Cross presented 1LT Stovall’s family with awards including the Purple Heart and the Mississippi Magnolia Cross for Meri-torious Service. ‘‘He made people want to fol-low him,’’ MG Cross said ‘‘He is the kind of person that doesn’t come along for genera-tions.’’ Hundreds of Neshoba County residents lined the nine mile route from the funeral home to the Coldwater Baptist Church ceme-tery where he was laid to rest. He was buried with full military honors. In August 2004, 1LT Stovall’s aunt, JoAnn Carney, wrote about her nephew in a post on Iraqwarheroes.com. ‘‘I loved him so very much,’’ Mrs. Carney said. ‘‘My nephew was a remarkable man that touched everyone he met. We are going to miss him so very much.’’ Following the death of 1LT Stovall, Stovall’s Sacrifice for Soldiers was founded. The Stovall Foundation offers financial assistance to mili-tary men and women defending our nation and to carry on the memory of 1LT Stovall. 1LT Stovall is survived by his son, Walker; his parents, Buck and Ellon Stovall; his sister, Marsha Stovall Vance; and his brother, Mark Stovall. This young, courageous soldier paid the ulti-mate sacrifice to protect the freedoms we all enjoy. 1LT Stovall will not be forgotten. f 
SUPPORT FOR THE URBAN AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION ACT 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR

community members can purchase fresh, healthy foods. There are more than 23 million individuals residing in these so called ‘‘food desert’’ neighborhoods, where there are no stores within one mile in which they can buy healthy food. Without healthy options, people are forced to eat unhealthy, processed, junk food, be-cause that is all that is available and afford-able. This bill is a step to correct this unac-ceptable trend. I am pleased to recognize and support the growing resurgence of locally grown and pro-duced product. I see it in my own district at places like the Toledo Farmers Market, the Robert J. Anderson Urban Agriculture Center and Farm, and the Old Brooklyn Cheese Com-pany in Cleveland, Ohio. Individuals, non-profits, and co-ops are step-ping up and taking action to address the chal-lenge of access to healthy food, by developing local food sources like community gardens to provide fresh, affordable produce throughout underserved communities. Not only are they growing product to provide to communities though, they are engaging and encouraging community participation all throughout the process. They are teaching community mem-bers how to farm. The Urban Agriculture Production Act en-courages economic development in under-nourished, underserved communities by fur-thering the mission of local farming. It shore ups the Department of Agriculture and their programs to support urban farmers and inspire communities to create self-sufficient food pro-duction systems that stimulate development and healthy eating options. All throughout our urban communities, there is an abundance of unused land and space that are conveniently located in neighborhoods that are ripe for agriculture development. We must support and encourage the means to de-velop these plots so they become local sources of wholesome food options. Community gardens, Greenhouses, Farm-ers’ Markets, and other local agriculture initia-tives have tremendous power to help diversify American food production. They can also help the nation rely less on foreign imports and cre-ate American jobs that cannot be outsourced. Moreover, communities that lack access to fresh, nutritious affordable foods are facing growing epidemics of obesity related diseases. We must get serious about addressing nation-ally recognized increases in preventable dis-ease in all our communities, but especially in those communities that have limited food op-tions. Prevention is paramount, and encour-aging a balanced diet while also providing ac-cess to healthier foods, through agriculture, is an obvious solution. The Urban Agriculture Production Act of 2017, therefore, sets out to spur the develop-ment and expansion of community agriculture in typically non-traditional agricultural produc-tion areas, like our cities and towns who face food insecurity, access, and nutrition chal-lenges. Mr. Speaker, urban farming, and food pro-duction should be part of our solution to sup-port healthier dietary options and improve the overall health of urban communities. The Urban Agriculture Production Act is the appro-priate means to further develop alternative, urban agricultural production and to help meet communities’ food production needs for the fu-ture.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-er, activism is often described as a theory or practice based on militant action, a state of being active, engaged, participating, dedicated consistent, promoting change, never-ending, always going. All of these words describe teacher, policewoman, law enforcement ex-pert, college professor, friend, humanitarian and much more. I could keep on writing for hours and would not adequately describe what Pat Hill has meant to me and countless oth-ers. She was an inspiration, a role model, a serious fighter for freedom, equality, and jus-tice. Pat, has fought the good fight, has earned the victory and may her soul rest in peace.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 
SPEECH OF  
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 6, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354) making ap-propriations for the Department of the Inte-rior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes: 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise to ex-press my strong and unwavering support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals pro-gram (DACA) and unyielding opposition to the President’s decision, announced by the Attor-ney General, to rescind a policy that liberated 800,000 young persons—124,000 of them in Texas—from the shadows of life, welcomed them into the mainstream, and encouraged them to realize their potential and achieve the American Dream. At the heart of the Trump Administration’s cruel, and heartless, and misguided decision to rescind DACA is the specious claim that President Obama lacked the constitutional and statutory authority to take executive actions to implement the DACA policy. That is why I offered an amendment to Divi-sion C of Rules Committee Print 115–31 that would prohibit the Administration from using appropriated funds to implement its decision to rescind DACA. Specifically, that Jackson Lee Amendment provided the following section at the end of Di-vision E of the bill: SEC.lll. None of the funds made avail-able in this Act may be used to finalize, imple-ment, administer, or enforce the Memorandum of September 5, 2017, from the Acting Sec-retary of Homeland Security pertaining to ‘‘Re-scission of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled ‘‘Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children.’’ Regrettably, this Jackson Lee Amendment was not made in order by the Rules Com-mittee. There was no need for the President to make any decision about DACA right now; there was pending no real deadline, no actual court case, no legal requirement. Florida is bracing for the impact of Hurri-cane Irma and Houston is still struggling to re-cover and rebuild in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, one of the most catastrophic weather events in the nation’s history. And in my congressional district, we are mourning the loss of the heroic DREAMER, Alonso Guillen, who came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, and died here his boat cap-sized while he was rescuing survivors of the flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area. The President and Attorney General should have focused on the crisis at hand and not created another one because of a made up deadline. There is no heart in ending DACA and leav-ing the fate of 800,000 young persons in limbo and at the mercy of a Republican Congress that has passed no major legislation and has no guarantee that the President would even sign a bill if they do. Republicans in Congress need to bring H.R. 3440, the Dream Act of 2017, to the floor right now and vote for it so it can pass both houses of Congress with a veto-proof majority. Mr. Chair, now let me briefly discuss why the executive actions taken by President Obama are reasonable, responsible, and with-in his constitutional authority. Pursuant to Article II, Section 3 of the Con-stitution, the President, the nation’s Chief Ex-ecutive, ‘‘shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’’ In addition to establishing the President’s obligation to execute the law, the Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the ‘‘Take Care’’ Clause as ensuring presidential control over those who execute and enforce the law and the authority to decide how best to en-force the laws. See, e.g., Arizona v. United States; Bowsher v. Synar; Buckley v. Valeo; Printz v. United States; Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB. Every law enforcement agency, including the agencies that enforce immigration laws, has ‘‘prosecutorial discretion’’—the inherent power to decide whom to investigate, arrest, detain, charge, and prosecute. Thus, enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), properly may exercise their discretion to de-vise and implement policies specific to the laws they are charged with enforcing, the pop-ulation they serve, and the problems they face so that they can prioritize our nation’s re-sources to meet mission critical enforcement goals. Mr. Chair, deferred action has been utilized in our nation for decades by Administrations headed by presidents of both parties without controversy or challenge. In fact, as far back as 1976, INS and DHS leaders have issued at least 11 different memoranda providing guidance on the use of similar forms of prosecutorial discretion. Executive authority to take action is thus ‘‘fairly wide,’’ and the federal government’s discretion is extremely ‘‘broad’’ as the Su-preme Court held in the recent case of Ari-zona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499

(2012), an opinion written Justice Kennedy and joined by Chief Justice Roberts: ‘‘Congress has specified which aliens may be removed from the United States and the procedures for doing so. Aliens may be re-moved if they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted of certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law. Re-moval is a civil, not criminal, matter. A prin-cipal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration offi-cials. Federal officials, as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all. If removal proceedings com-mence, aliens may seek asylum and other dis-cretionary relief allowing them to remain in the country or at least to leave without formal re-moval.’’ (emphasis added) (citations omitted). The Court’s decision in Arizona v. United States, also strongly suggests that the execu-tive branch’s discretion in matters of deporta-tion may be exercised on an individual basis, or it may be used to protect entire classes of individuals such as ‘‘[u]nauthorized workers trying to support their families’’ or immigrants who originate from countries torn apart by in-ternal conflicts: ‘‘Discretion in the enforcement of immigra-tion law embraces immediate human con-cerns. Unauthorized workers trying to support their families, for example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime. The equities of an in-dividual case may turn on many factors, in-cluding whether the alien has children born in the United States, long ties to the community, or a record of distinguished military service. Some discretionary decisions involve policy choices that bear on this Nation’s international relations. Returning an alien to his own coun-try may be deemed inappropriate even where he has committed a removable offense or fails to meet the criteria for admission. The foreign state may be mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or enduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien or his fam-ily will be harmed upon return. The dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the Executive Branch to en-sure that enforcement policies are consistent with this Nation’s foreign policy with respect to these and other realities.’’ Exercising thoughtful discretion in the en-forcement of the nation’s immigration law saves scarce taxpayer funds, optimizes limited resources, and produces results that are more humane and consistent with America’s reputa-tion as the most compassionate nation on earth. Mr. Chair, a DREAMER (an undocumented student) seeking to earn her college degree and aspiring to attend medical school to better herself and her new community is not a threat to the nation’s security. Law abiding but unauthorized immigrants doing honest work to support their families pose far less danger to society than human traffickers, drug smugglers, or those who have committed a serious crime. President Obama was correct in concluding that exercising his discretion regarding the im-plementation of DACA enhances the safety of all members of the public, serves national se-curity interests, and furthers the public interest in keeping families together. Mr. Chair, according to numerous studies conducted by the Congressional Budget Of-fice, Social Security Administration, and Coun-cil of Economic Advisors, the DACA generates substantial economic benefits to our nation. For example, unfreezing DAPA and ex-panded DACA is estimated to increase GDP by $230 billion and create an average of 28,814 jobs per year over the next 10 years. That is a lot of jobs! Mr. Chair, in exercising his broad discretion in the area of removal proceedings, President Obama acted responsibly and reasonably in determining the circumstances in which it makes sense to pursue removal and when it does not. In exercising this broad discretion, President Obama did nothing was novel or unprece-dented. Let me cite a just a few examples of execu-tive action taken by American presidents, both Republican and Democratic, on issues affect-ing immigrants over the past 35 years: 1. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan used executive action in 1987 to allow 200,000 Nicaraguans facing deportation to apply for re-lief from expulsion and work authorization. 2. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter exer-cised parole authority to allow Cubans to enter the U.S., and about 123,000 ‘‘Mariel Cubans’’ were paroled into the U.S. by 1981. 3. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush issued an executive order that granted De-ferred Enforced Departure (DED) to certain nationals of the People’s Republic of China who were in the United States. 4. In 1992, the Bush administration granted DED to certain nationals of El Salvador. 5. In 1997, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order granting DED to certain Hai-tians who had arrived in the United States be-fore Dec. 31, 1995. 6. In 2010, the Obama Administration began a policy of granting parole to the spouses, par-ents, and children of military members. Mr. Chair, because of President Obama’s leadership and visionary executive action, 124,000 undocumented immigrants in my home state of Texas have received deferred action. 91 percent of these immigrants are em-ployed or in school and contribute $6.3 billion annually to the Texas economy and $460.3 billion to the national economy. Mr. Chair, let me note that DACA was and is a welcome development but not a substitute for undertaking the comprehensive reform and modernization of the nation’s immigration laws supported by the American people. Only Congress can do that. America’s borders are dynamic, with con-stantly evolving security challenges. Border security must be undertaken in a manner that allows actors to use pragmatism and common sense. Comprehensive immigration reform is des-perately needed to ensure that Lady Liberty’s lamp remains the symbol of a land that wel-comes immigrants to a community of immi-grants and does so in a manner that secures our borders and protects our homeland. Instead of wasting time scapegoating DREAMERS, we should instead seize the op-portunity to pass legislation that secures our borders, preserves America’s character as the most open and welcoming country in the his-tory of the world, and will yield hundreds of bil-lions of dollars in economic growth.
