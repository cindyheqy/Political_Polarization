Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today I honor His Holiness Mahant Swami Maharaj, the new spiritual leader and guru of the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Sanstha (BAPS)—a global Hindu sociospiritual organization—as he makes a historically important visit to BAPS devotees across North America. BAPS is an impactful organization, aiming to preserve the values of family unity, selfless service, interfaith harmony and peaceful coexistence. They reach these goals through various activities and endeavors centered around spirituality, characterbuilding, and human welfare. This often includes largescale charitable events, community outreach activities, and in depth educational programs for young people. His Holiness Mahant Swami Maharaj is now the sixth guru of BAPS, having being blessed by Pramukh Swami Maharaj as his successor. His Holiness has been an enthusiastic devotee of BAPS since his youth, having taken diksha (i.e. being appointed a saint) in 1961. Over time, his outstanding virtues of austerity, selfcontrol, devotion, humility and service have earned him his affectionate title. Following in Pramukh Swami’s footsteps, Mahant Swami has pledged to propagate peace, especially in a time of unrest in the world. Every time I visit the beautiful BAPS Mandir in Bartlett, Illinois and visit with their devotees and volunteers there, I am reminded of the excellent virtues that BAPS represents and that America should celebrate. I honor His Holiness Mahant Swami Maharaj, the spiritual leader and guru of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha organization. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, June 29, 2017, I was unable to record my Roll Call vote. Had I been present, I would have voted YES on Roll Call vote No. 341, on the motion to recommit H.R. 3003, with instructions. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Ivan Lee Welty, as he retires from a 45year career as an engineer and land surveyor on the Mendocino Coast. Born in Hill City, Kansas, in 1942, Mr. Welty received his degree in Civil Engineering from Kansas State University before making his way to Mendocino, California. He distinguished himself quickly by participating in efforts to establish the Class K Housing designation that expanded affordable housing options in rural Mendocino County. In 1975 he started his business, I.L. Welty and Associates, which has provided engineering and design services for more than 40 years. As a business owner, Mr. Welty provided pro bono engineering and design work to numerous nonprofits including the Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens, the Humane Society, the Mendocino Coast Hospitality Center, the Kelley House Museum, and Habitat for Humanity. In addition to donating his time, Mr. Welty paid his staff to assist on many of these projects over the years. Mr. Welty married the love of his life, Sally, in 1974. Together they were active in many environmental and community issues. They helped found the Mendocino Land Trust and reinstitute the historic Mendocino Fourth of July Parade. They were also strong supporters of the Mendocino Whale Wars, in which community members fought the international whaling fleets to end whaling in and around Cape Mendocino. The first Mendocino Whale War Festival, now the Mendocino Coast Whale Festival, swiftly became an annual tradition that continues today. Lee Welty’s career is one of dedicated service to his community and the environment. Please join me in congratulating him on his retirement and expressing our deep appreciation for his outstanding contributions to the Mendocino Coast. f 
CONGRATULATING REP. MIKE TYRON ON BEING NAMED GRAND MARSHAL OF THE CRYSTAL LAKE INDEPENDENCE PARADE 
Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dedicated public servant from the Sixth Congressional District of Illinois, Representative Mike Tyron of Crystal Lake. In July, he was named the Grand Marshal of the Crystal Lake 2017 Independence Parade. As a resident of Crystal Lake since 1983, Representative Tyron has served as a model citizen. He first entered public office in 1989 as a McHenry County Board member, and nine years later was unanimously selected to be its Chairman. He served in this capacity until being elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 2004. During his tenure as a state representative, Representative Tyron was an exemplary leader and public servant. He spearheaded a rewriting of the taxcap law to save taxpayers millions of dollars and close a loophole. He pushed an initiative to create an online transparency portal to list all state government salaries, contracts and expenditures, one of the first of its kind. He also helped create the county veterans’ courts. The specialized court allows returning veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder or other servicerelated disabilities who commit nonviolent offenses to receive treatment and have charges dismissed upon successful completion of the program. Representative Tyron has represented McHenry County, Crystal Lake, and the surrounding community well. He has been a strong voice for the Village of Crystal Lake throughout his time in public office. His long service to the people of Crystal Lake and to Illinois is truly commendable. Although he retired from public service in January, Crystal Lake will continue to benefit from his involvement as a member of the community. Mr. Speaker and distinguished colleagues, please join me in congratulating Representative Mike Tyron on 28 years of public service, and on being named the Grand Marshal of the Crystal Lake 2017 Independence Parade. f 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the wartime service of longtime resident of the Village of Morton Grove, Illinois. Earlier this month, the Consul General of France in Chicago, Vincent Floreani, recognized J. Herman Sitrick as a French Knight of the Legion of Honor. The award recognizes Mr. Sitrick’s extraordinary bravery and critical contribution to allied efforts to liberate France from Nazi occupation. Joining the United States Army as a teenager, Mr. Sitrick participated in the DDay landings on the beaches of Normandy, helping to open a second allied front in occupied Europe and suffering a shrapnel wound in the process. He fought with his unit as allied forces pushed back German forces across Europe. In January 1945, Mr. Sitrick found himself stationed in the Ardennes Forest, participating in what history calls the Battle of the Bulge. It was during that action that Mr. Sitrick had the quick thinking and bravery to capture twenty one German soldiers as they sought shelter from the biting cold—turning them over to reinforcing units the next morning. I am forever grateful to J. Herman Sitrick for his service. We must not forget what he and so many other service members went through in World War II as they risked, and in many cases sacrificed, their lives to defend freedom. I also want to recognize the efforts of the French government, as they work to recognize 
veterans who have done their duty and deserve recognition. I thank Mr. Sitrick for all that he’s done for our country. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Scleroderma Awareness Month and on behalf of scleroderma patients throughout the United States. Initiatives like Scleroderma Awareness Month help raise awareness about the disease while driving research and action that results in new treatments for this and other illnesses. Scleroderma is a chronic and disabling connective tissue and rheumatic disorder resulting from an overproduction of collagen in the skin, tissue, and underlying muscle. The disease manifests itself in two forms: localized scleroderma, effecting the skin and underlying tissue, and systemic scleroderma, also known as systemic sclerosis, a potentially lifethreatening disease that attacks internal organs including the lungs, heart, kidneys, esophagus and gastrointestinal tract. The wide range of symptoms as well as the localized and systemic variations of the disease make it especially hard to diagnose. The average diagnosis is made 5 years after the onset of symptoms. Once diagnosed, however, people with Scleroderma can only look forward to symptomatic relief, as there is no known cure. It is critical that we work to raise awareness of scleroderma and related diseases while encouraging research that could lead to breakthroughs in treating this disease. Scleroderma often leads to swelling, hardening and thickening of the skin, blood vessel spasms with severe discomfort in the fingers and toes, weight loss, joint pain, swallowing difficulties, nonhealing ulcerations on the fingertips and extreme fatigue. In its more advanced forms, scleroderma can prevent patients from performing even the simplest tasks. Given the lack of treatment options and the disease’s effects on individuals’ quality of life, we must continue to explore therapies and treatments to alleviate these symptoms. I was proud to cosponsor legislation last Congress that would encourage continued research investment in this area so that innovative therapies can be developed, and it is my hope that we continue our efforts to combat scleroderma. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing June as National Scleroderma Awareness Month. We must continue to support investment in this area so that there will one day be a cure for this devastating disease.
