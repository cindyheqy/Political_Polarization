Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, on his recent trip to Asia, President Trump reminded us and our international trading partners that our commercial agreements must be honest, fair, and reciprocal. With this admonition, he called on our Asian friends to build automobile plants that would employ American workers. Three cheers for him for doing that. The United States already has experienced the benefits and the liabilities of foreigncontrolled multinational automobile companies manufacturing in our country. These companies have provided good jobs for America’s working people, but having these foreign companies here hasn’t always worked. A few years ago, we discovered that one of the world’s preeminent car manufacturers, Volkswagen Group of America, had engaged in an illegal and clandestine strategy to circumvent U.S. emissions laws. Volkswagen has a longstanding relationship with the American people. Like so many young people in my generation, my first car was a Volkswagen Beetle, so Volkswagen enjoyed an enormous goodwill in our country. Despite that, Volkswagen Group of America intentionally did us wrong. Volkswagen intentionally violated our emissions regulations and, by many accounts, they even engineered their systems to falsely indicate that they were complying with the emissions standards. This was nothing more than pure arrogance and a hostile intent and an egregious violation of our best legislative efforts to regulate our way to clean air. Unfortunately, this issue with Volkswagen has not been totally dealt with and put behind us. The deal with the German Government that got them off the hook remains cloaked in mystery and left many questions unanswered. We do not know yet, for example, whether Volkswagen will compensate Americans in a full and just manner. Those uncompensated Americans may include the owners of the bogusly engineered cars, as well as auto importers, as well as, perhaps, service stations who officially were authorized to repair Volkswagens. Mr. Speaker, the VW deal between the Obama administration and the Merkel government needs to be revisited with a full airing of the details. We need to know if Volkswagen has complied fully and if the settlement was demonstrably fair to Americans who relied on their good faith. Wolfgang Porsche, the family who owns 52 percent of Volkswagen, he was the chairman during this time of the emissions scandal; as well as Matthias Mueller, the CEO of Volkswagen Group, they need to be put on the record about what the details of this subterfuge of American law was all about. We need to send a message also. By putting them on the record, we need to send a message to all the multinational corporation executives who, when they do business in the United States of America, have to play by our rules. I applaud the President for trying to encourage people to invest in building factories here, but that means all of us must make sure that that works out for the best for the American people. f 
SCORE ONE FOR DONALD TRUMP The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, after spending a bizarre week in the Ways and Means Committee with a moving target of the Republican tax plan, we find out, amazingly, that it is actually getting worse and worse. We have just discovered that the Senate is going to repeal the individual healthcare mandate to to provide funding for more tax cuts for America’s wealthy. The cost of that? There will be 13 million additional uninsured Americans, and everybody in the individual market will see their premiums increase another 10 percent next year and every year therefafter. Well, tomorrow, Trump is going to come to Capitol Hill to hold a rally 
with Republican Members to try to make some of these nervous people feel a little more comfortable. No wonder Donald Trump is eager to see this bill pass. It is designed for Donald Trump. First, he is the selfproclaimed king of debt. Well, you got it in spades with this bill because the Republicans have raised the debt ceiling $1.5 trillion to finance these tax cuts for people who, frankly, don’t need them. Because you have to pay interest on that, it is a $2.3 trillion additional burden on our children and grandchildren. It eliminates the alternative minimum tax. Even though Trump refused to honor his commitment to release his tax returns, one was leaked to David Cay Johnston, and it showed the only reason he paid substantial taxes in 2005 was because of the alternative minimum tax. Getting rid of that would save him $31 million in one year. There is a special break for passthrough entities. It is, theoretically, for small businesses, but many of the passthrough entities are not small businesses. They include hedge funds. Donald Trump’s disclosure form lists hundreds of passthrough entities. That is how he does business. Of course, the biggest and most outrageous loophole is to completely eliminate the inheritance tax over the next 10 years. This will save a couple thousand people, extraordinarily wealthy people, $172 billion that would otherwise come to the government to be able to fund programs for our veterans, deal with the opioid crisis. Donald Trump will be able to pass off hundreds of millions, maybe a billion or two, tax free. Remember, most of that money had never been taxed in the first place. You don’t become a billionaire on W–2 income. It is all appreciated, untaxed capital. Well, it also shatters a bipartisan agreement for alternative energy. Donald Trump is doubling down on energy of the past, trying to breathe life into a failing coal industry. Their bill would break a bipartisan agreement for wind energy, which we carefully negotiated on a bipartisan basis, and the industry has gone ahead and pledged billions of dollars. Eliminating that agreement, the only retroactive provision in the bill, puts at jeopardy billions of dollars of investment and tens of thousands of jobs. Score one for Donald Trump. But the worst element of this bill, I think—and there is a lot to choose from—is its Alzheimer’s tax. It would deny the medical exemption to over 9 million middle class families to be able to deduct extraordinary medical expenses. Think of a family that is trying to cope with the challenges of a loved one with Alzheimer’s. This costs them tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year. It takes away the tax deduction from them. This is an outrage. It is made for Donald Trump and large corporations, but, sadly, it increases taxes on many middleincome Americans, especially with the Alzheimer’s tax, denying some of the middle class families in the most difficult circumstances a little tax relief. It is inexcusable. They couldn’t defend it in committee. Let’s see how the Republicans defend it on the floor of the House. But more important, let’s see how they defend that to 9 million American families. 
FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes. Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my support to the flood insurance reform legislation that we considered on this floor yesterday and passed. Let me tell you the reasons and the importance of that particular legislation. One is, the problems that it deals with is FEMA’s flood plain maps can be inaccurate and are based on old technology. Property owners in the insurance flood plain plans are required to pay flood insurance premiums, even though they may not be at risk under the old maps whenever you look at it. For example, today I brought a map from my district—one of the places in my district where these maps are wrong. This is actually Carterville, Illinois. If you will notice, as the flood plain comes down here from the north, actually, that is really unique because, if you will notice right beside it, out of the flood plain is the creek that actually flows and the ditch that is the creek, and the flood plain is not in that. Yet it is over in the other area here, where it affects homes that are actually charged larger amounts of money on their flood insurance when they are not even in the flood plain. Yet it never even continues to flow on down to Crab Orchard Lake, where the natural water flow goes. So those areas are out of the flood plain, according to this mapping. The flood zone maps—here is the problem: property owners can challenge the map under existing law, before we sent this over, and you can challenge it, but it would cost you $2,000 to challenge that. Or if you wanted to participate with your city, the city taxes would then be charged $17,000 to challenge the map. Flood insurance is vitally important and necessary to the people around this Nation and the security that it gives to others that are not in flood plains for not having a cost dropped on them. But the accuracy of these maps are vitally important. Two things the legislation did that were vitally important, it is easier and more affordable to appeal FEMA about their maps and whether or not something is in a flood plain. It also uses its higher technology to truly draft the flood plain maps in a way that they are fair, and that the costs are not unbearable to many homeowners. THE GOP TAX BILL IS A FRONTAL ASSAULT ON THE MIDDLE CLASS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, the tax bill being considered, H.R. 1, is a frontal assault on the middle class and it will do lasting damage to our country. The bill is a dishonest baitand switch for the 36 million middle and lower class families who will see their taxes increase under this plan to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans and large multinational corporations. It is paid for by eliminating the few remaining benefits in our Tax Code for the middle class and charging $1.7 trillion to the national credit card, leaving our children and our grandchildren to pay for it. This bill lets the middle class down at every turn, and it should be defeated. It eliminates the deduction for medical expenses, which over 9 million middle class Americans claimed in 2015, including over 1 million taxpayers in my home State of California. This is especially harmful to older Americans struggling with high medical costs and serious illnesses, like cancer and Alzheimer’s, and Americans with disabilities. It takes direct aim at college students across the country, raising the future costs of higher education by $65 billion over 10 years by eliminating the deductibility of interest on student loans. It taxes employer tuition assistance benefits for students and tuition waivers for graduate students by treating this as income, making it more expensive for future scientists, medical professionals, educators, and other leaders to get an education. b1015 It eliminates the lifetime learning credit and the deductibility of interest of student loans at a time when student loan debt in the United States just reached $1.5 trillion. This is a bitter pill to ask our Nation’s student borrowers to swallow. Very importantly for my constituents, this bill bulldozes the State and local tax deduction. Almost 200,000 of my constituents claimed an average State and local tax deduction of $31,193 in 2015. Under this plan, businesses can still claim this deduction. For example, the National Education Association estimates are that 250,000 education jobs will be put at risk because of this lack of deductibility. Just yesterday, the Fraternal Order of Police spoke out in opposition to this bill’s dismantling of this deduction, noting that their salaries and the equipment that they use are paid for by State and local taxes on property sales and income. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that California stands to be the biggest overall loser in this plan and faces a $12.1 billion tax increase in 2017 alone. The bill also takes aim at the most valuable asset of the middle class: 
their home. It limits the mortgage interest deduction used by homeowners, and this is eminently unfair. Californians just experienced the worst wildfires in our State’s history, with over 14,000 homes lost. What does this bill do? It removes the deductibility for property losses due to natural disasters. I find this to be especially cruel. What the bill does do is take special care of the wealthiest 5,500 estates in this country by doubling the estate tax exemption to $22 million and then repealing it, removing the whole thing, by 2024. Finally, the bill has terrible implications for the future of Medicare and the guarantee it has provided for Americans for over 50 years. Without budget changes to offset the $1.5 trillion increase to deficits over 10 years, the bill will trigger automatic spending cuts under the statutory payasyougo. The Republican majority and the administration claim that this tax plan will ‘‘pay for itself.’’ It is bad math, because we were promised in the early 2000s that jobs would be created, that the economy would grow, and the outcome was $1.8 trillion of debt. The investments that pay off the most are the investments we make in the American people, in education, in job creation, in infrastructure. These are critical areas that always expand our economy. This House should reject this unfair, unbalanced, fiscally irresponsible plan that dims the future of our country by attacking the middle class. 
APPRENTICESHIPS PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE PATH TO HIGH PAYING JOBS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BOST). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP SON) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this is a pretty incredible week here in Washington, D.C., an incredible week for the American people. When you look at the things that we accomplished this week, we have had historic tax reform—long overdue. This is a break for hardworking middle class American families. I encourage folks to check out the facts for themselves on exactly what happens. But it is not the only thing we have done. Already this week we have passed a conference report on the national defense authorization, the largest raise for our military in over 10 years, providing them the resources they need to be safe, to be effective, yes, to be lethal, and to be able to return home at the end of the day and to have their needs met. We did something that was very important for a State like Pennsylvania, where we have almost 90,000 miles of streams. We did historic flood insurance reform, where we really separated and looked inland, the needs there, versus mixing things together, allowing local municipalities, as long as they comply with the FEMA processes, to be able to really determine where the actual flood risk is. We haven’t had that. In the past, it has all been done from Washington. It has been done rather poorly. But there is more than that. This week is also National Apprenticeship Week, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to highlight apprenticeships. Apprenticeships are a part of career and technological education as a pathway to familysustaining careers and wages. Apprenticeships provide an alternative path to a highpaying job by providing opportunities to gain real world skills while earning a paycheck. Mr. Speaker, as cochair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus, I know that a huge skills gap exists in communities nationwide. There are goodpaying jobs out there, but the unemployed are either ill prepared or lack the appropriate education to fill these vacancies. That is why I am proud the House did pass my legislation, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, earlier this year. It passed unanimously out of this body. The bill aims to close the skills gap by modernizing Federal investments in career and technical education programs by connecting educators with industry stakeholders. Career and technical education apprenticeship programs open the door for so many Americans. Proudly, President Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to expand apprenticeships and skillsbased education programs that put more Americans back to work in the trades. We have seen too many students pushed down the collegeforall pathway that just doesn’t work for some people. Obtaining an apprenticeship or career and technical education is a viable path that many highachieving students can choose in pursuit of industry certifications and handson skills that they use right out of high school, in skillsbased education programs, or should they choose, in college. Mr. Speaker, we have all met young people who haven’t been inspired in a traditional classroom setting. We all know people who have lost jobs who are underemployed, working multiple parttime jobs, and they are looking desperately for goodpaying, family sustaining jobs. We all know people who are aspiring for a promotion but keep falling short year after year. Mr. Speaker, I think we all know families that have been trapped in poverty for generations. An apprenticeship can change that. A career and technical education can change that. Mr. Speaker, by the year 2020, it is estimated that more than 6 million jobs will go unfilled because of that skills gap of not having individuals who are qualified and trained to fill those positions. Mr. Speaker, the legislation that will be passed off this floor tomorrow—and I speak of that optimistically, with confidence—is estimated to lead to creating a confidence that will result, it has been estimated, in a million jobs being created. Through measures with career and technical education and measures such as apprenticeships, we can help Americans to be able to enter the workforce, to find that onramp to opportunity, to give everyone the opportunity to earn a good familysustaining wage and have that security. Mr. Speaker, Americans deserve no less. f 
A TRUE STORY FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell you a true story from Scranton, Pennsylvania. When Matty Loftus got out of the Army in 1970, he went to work for the TV tube plant in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, just north of Scranton. At the time, it was owned by RCA and later became Thompson Consumer Electronics. Matty Loftus was 19 years old, and this was a great job, manufacturing picture tubes where a lot of great people worked, as many as 1,600 men and women. The pay was good; the benefits were excellent. They were union jobs, and the picture tubes they put together were so good, this company was able to sell them to Sony in Japan. The people working at this plant were a community. They had wonderful company picnics. They had a softball league. They organized holiday parties for the kids and fishing derbies. Matty Loftus worked there for 30 years. He was able to raise four children on his salary alone. Chuck Lampman is the same age as Matty Loftus, and they are friends. Chuck went to work for the RCA plant in 1972 when he was 21. He started in production, and he loved that job, too. He says: We were making the Cadillac of American televisions. By the year 2000, we were already starting to make the first generation of flat screen TV panels. Around that time, Thompson won a worldwide award for making the best 27inch TVs in the world, and everybody at the plant was so proud. Chuck says: That wasn’t just a job; that was a way of life. John O’Hearn got out of high school in 1975. He got a job at the TV plant right away. He worked production at first, but then he got bumped up into the machine shop. He made lifelong friends at that factory. In 1994, NAFTA went into effect. Matty, Chuck, and John, they knew about it, but they didn’t think too much about it. John remembers people in the machine shop who were interested in politics arguing over the effects of NAFTA. 
Through the nineties, these men and women were working the factory 24/7 in three shifts, putting out over 2 million picture tubes a year. They used to say: They will never close us down. We make this company too much money. And then it came, May of 2001. Management called everybody into the plant and gave them the news. The plant was closing in August, 3 months from then, because they were moving to Mexico. People were shocked. Nobody saw this coming. They tried to negotiate with the company, and Matty and Chuck remember the answer. It was: Are you willing to take a $13anhour pay cut and work for $3.25 an hour? Matty remembers the pride that these people had at the plant working the last few months, the pride that they did their jobs with. There was no vandalism. There were no work stoppages, no slowdowns. They finished out their jobs showing the pride in the work that they had had for a generation. He remembers the tears on that last day and how people passed out lists of names and phone numbers so they could all stay in touch. Chuck remembers on the last day how that trophy for the best 27inch TV tube was still in the company lobby. All three of them remember the aftermath. They remember the divorces. They remember the suicides. Matty still had two daughters in public school. He went through his family savings, and he had to cash in some of his retirement money, take the penalty. Now he works as a security guard making $10 an hour. He is 66, and he can’t afford to retire. Chuck was out of work for years, and eventually he found a job making half the money. He is also 66, and he can’t retire. John can’t forget having to tell his daughter, Lindsey, in May 2001 he was losing his job. She was in tears. She was graduating high school the next month. She wanted to go to college. When Chuck found out the current Republican tax plan is to drop corporate tax to 20 percent for companies doing business in America but to 10 percent for American companies doing business overseas, this is what he said: Haven’t we lost enough already under NAFTA? Now you are going to reward companies for shipping more jobs overseas? Mr. Speaker, this tax bill will ship more jobs overseas. This bill stinks, and I won’t vote for it. 
LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, today we recognize an individual who embodies the American Dream and the grit and determination that defines the people of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Pasquale Palino was born in Naples, Italy, in 1963. A resilient worker and a passionate chef, he worked in the restaurant industry in Italy before marrying his wife, Anna Scotto. Having two children, Carmela and Gennaro, Pasquale decided to leave Italy with his young family and come to the United States. He settled in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, and opened a restaurant, Pasta al Dente. Soon after, he welcomed his third child, Nunzia. After spending a short while back in Italy, Pasquale returned to the United States. A family man, Pasquale had two more sons, Giovanni and Aniello. Pasquale opened Vecchia Osteria in 2009, where his incredible talent led to great success and allowed him to open Acqua e Farina, an authentic Napoletano pizzeria, in 2017. Mr. Speaker, Pasquale crossed oceans to pursue his dreams. He works tirelessly to put a smile on people’s faces through the food that he makes. Mr. Speaker, our communities and our Nation are better because of people like Pasquale Palino. b1030 HONORING BUCKS COUNTY FIRST RESPONDERS

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, we honor and we thank each of these brave heroes in our community for putting themselves in harm’s way to protect us in Bucks County. They are living their lives serving a cause bigger than themselves. What a noble way to spend their life. 
TAX BILL IS HARMFUL TO VETERANS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) for 5 minutes. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the ranking member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, as the co chair of the National Guard and Reserve Components Caucus, as the co chair of the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus, and probably more importantly, as a retired enlisted soldier to bring to your attention a number of provisions in the GOP tax bill that will negatively impact the men and women currently serving and transitioning from the United States military. Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear. Tax reform is a laudable goal. It would have been nice had we actually done it, had we actually had debates, had we actually had witnesses. Zero, zero, zero. What we have is a closeddoor bill brought forward and forced upon the House. In my opinion, trying to think that the American people would not watch what happens here is pretty risky. These are folks in the military who risked everything to give us the right to debate things here. We should at least probably debate their future in an open manner. I hope we will strongly consider, Mr. Speaker, each of these following provisions in this bill that will put the prosperity of America’s heroes at risk. As the legislation is written, this tax plan includes provisions that will specifically harm members and veterans to help pay for tax cuts for corporations and the ultrawealthy. How can you justify giving a tax cut for carrying interest, but not for carrying a rucksack? That is what that vote will be today. Be very clear about this. When you cast your ‘‘yes’’ vote, you are being very clear. The first thing it does is it repeals tax credits proven to help veterans find employment when they come home, such as the repeal of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which includes the Help Hire Our Heroes Act. This credit is available to employers who hire veterans who have a serviceconnected disability, or are unemployed, or receive SNAP benefits. Between 2013 and 2015, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit helped nearly 300,000 veterans find employment. But, again, don’t take my word for it. The people who are telling you not to do this are the Air Force Sergeants Association, the United States Air Force Association, AMVETS, Army Aviation Association of America, Association of the United States Army, Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, Gold Star Wives of America, Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, Marine Corps League, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Vietnam Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. They are telling you, if you vote ‘‘yes,’’ you are hurting the opportunities of America’s veterans. The GOP tax bill also repeals the disabled access tax credit. This simply allows small businesses to claim a tax 
expenditure when they make their buildings more accessible for people with disabilities. Its elimination will discourage small businesses from making their workplaces accessible and friendly to those disabled veterans. Mr. Speaker, by eliminating the deduction for interest payments or student loans, the GOP tax bill will make education even more expensive or out of reach for our veterans. While the GI Bill pays a portion of it, it does not pay it all. A large percentage of veterans also rely on student loans. This will hurt many veterans who rely on that to make school work. This bill will make it more expensive for military families to sell their homes. How wrong is that? The bill requires a homeowner to have owned and lived in a home for at least 5 years of the last 8 years to get a tax exemption on the money made from the sale of their home. No one serves in one location that long. No exemption was written in it. Had it been brought to the floor, we would have offered an amendment, and I bet you money, my Republican colleagues would have accepted it. They didn’t get that chance because somebody wrote it for them and passed it down here and is going to tell them to vote ‘‘yes’’ on it. That is simply wrong. I don’t question their commitment to veterans. I question the way they wrote this bill. That is real life. These things will really happen, and it is verified by all kinds of outside sources. By repealing the medical expense deduction, the GOP tax bill will hurt veterans struggling with costly medical bills. Most veterans aren’t in the VA. Most veterans don’t qualify for the VA because they make more money than the threshold, or they are not disabled to the point where they get there. So most of them receive their health benefits through their employer. But when those expenses get too great, one of the things we have in current tax law is they are allowed to deduct those expenses. They are taking that away. When you vote ‘‘yes’’ today, you are taking that away and giving billionaires a tax break. Once again, it is going to be a choice. It is very simple, yes or no; green light, red light. You will be able to decide on that. This hurts veterans. By prioritizing corporations and the ultrawealthy over the middle class, they are directly harming veterans. Be very clear: a veteran’s median income is $37,466. They are not going to see savings from this bill. If they are a disabled veteran or have a child going to college, they will pay more so that a very few of us can get a tax break. Corporations, by the way, can deduct State and local taxes. Veterans can’t. A corporation can deduct property tax. There is a lot more in here that is bad. Bring this back to the floor. Work with us. Protect America’s heroes. Do what is right. BUILD A BETTER TOMORROW The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I tell folks back home that they should watch this time at 10 in the morning, where any Member can come down and talk about anything they want to talk about, because you can learn a lot about one another. There are folks who come to this floor every single morning to celebrate somebody in their district back home, to build up the country with optimism, and with the belief that if only we unite, if only we work harder, we can make tomorrow better than yesterday was. There are those Members who come to the floor on a regular basis to tear things down. I tell you, Mr. Speaker, I have been in this world for 47 years. I know it is easier to tear things down than it is to build things up. Something has happened in this institution where the currency is how quickly can you tear the other side down instead of how quickly can you partner with them to build things up. Tax reform is hard. I have a bill for folks who are uncomfortable with the elimination of special carveouts, deductions, exemptions, and lobbyist loopholes. For folks who are uncomfortable with those things, I have a bill that repeals absolutely every one. It is called the FairTax Act. It is H.R. 25. We are not going to vote on that bill today because this institution is not comfortable eliminating absolutely everything all at once. But there is a difference of opinion, Mr. Speaker, in what the Tax Code is designed for. Is it designed to punish people that you dislike and reward people that you do like? Or is it designed simply to raise the revenue so that the government can do the things it needs to do? I believe the latter. My friends have come to the floor today and they have said: Oh, we are eliminating this exemption and that deduction, and that carveout and that loophole, and those things help with the cost of education. Well, I say to my friends: If we want to help with the cost of education, let’s deal with education. The Tax Code is not the solution to every problem. Oftentimes it is the source of those problems. For folks who believe that the cost of medical care is too expensive, I agree. Another carveout, another loophole, another exemption, the Tax Code will not solve that problem. It may mask that problem, but it will not solve it. We have to come together to solve the healthcare inflation problem. I say to my friends who are worried about the medical cost deduction: I worry about that, too. I worried about it when the Affordable Care Act made it 33 percent harder for Americans to claim that; when it raised that base level from 7.5 percent to 10 percent, meaning so many more Americans couldn’t claim it. This bill doubles the standard deduction so that families don’t have to worry about the magnitude of their burden. Simply, the fact that they have a burden means that they will be able to exempt it. My friend from Pennsylvania came and told the story of two families from Pennsylvania working in a picture tube factory. It was a powerful story of American manufacturing disappearing. If I looked around this institution to find a millennial here, they wouldn’t even know what a picture tube is. That factory was going to go out of business because technology surpassed it. We are losing American manufacturing overseas every single day, not because we are not the hardest working people on the planet, but because we have the most punitive Tax Code on the planet. Everyone here knows it. In 1986, everyone knew it. America had the least competitive Tax Code on the planet, but Democrats and Republicans came together—Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill—and they took America from worst to first. Decades of economic prosperity ensued. We are doing that very same thing today: worst to first. Would be that it were Democrats and Republicans together that were doing that, but I tell you, Mr. Speaker, the time is not too late to come together to do that. It was a worthy goal in 1986. It is a worthy goal today. The Tax Code should not be picking winners and losers. It should be creating an economic environment where the American worker can succeed; where the American worker and its commitment is not at a disadvantage to the rest of the world, but it is at least on a level playing field, if not advantaged to the rest of the world. We can do that together today, and I hope that we will. It will always be easier to tear things down and than to build things up, Mr. Speaker. But I know the men and women in this Chamber on a personal level, and I know they didn’t come to tear things down. They came to build a better day tomorrow for their children, their grandchildren, and the constituents that they represent. Mr. Speaker, I hope that we will fulfill that promise together. 
TAX PLAN IS HARMFUL FOR GUAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to H.R. 1, the Republican tax plan, and the negative impacts it would have on my constituents in Guam. This bill is an attack on the middle class and would do very little to help those who most need tax relief. I am especially concerned that H.R. 1 does not take into account the unique application of the Federal Tax Code to Guam and the other U.S. territories. 
Unlike the 50 States who have control of their tax system, Guam is required to mirror the income tax portion of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, and any changes to the IRC would have a direct impact not only on taxes paid by my constituents, but also on the general fund revenues collected by the government of Guam. Under the current framework, it is the United States Congress, not the Guam Legislature or any other elected body on Guam, that sets the income tax provisions for our territory. Any changes to the Internal Revenue Code are automatically mirrored and adopted as changes to Guam’s local tax structure. This does not give Guam the ability to decide for itself the best tax structure for the people of Guam. It applies decisions made for the Nation as a whole, with more than 320 million citizens, to significantly different demographics on our island of just 170,000 Americans. Even more outrageous, Mr. Speaker, is that Republicans will have brought this bill to the floor without any opportunity for the Delegates from the territories to affect it or express our support or opposition through a recorded vote. As the Speaker knows, as a Delegate from a territory, along with the other four territories and D.C., we are not able to vote on amendments on the floor of this House, nor are we able to cast a vote on the final passage of a bill. Some on the other side will argue, especially since H.R. 1 is a tax bill, that the Delegates—therefore, the more than 4 million American citizens who live in the territories—should not be able to vote on the bills considered by this House because our constituents do not pay taxes to the Federal Treasury. b1045 But this ignores the sacrifices that the sons and daughters of Guam and the other territories make to defend our country through military service, as well as the fact that my constituents pay other Federal taxes that support Federal programs like Social Security and Medicare. Importantly, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 will have a direct impact on my constituents because of the Federal Government’s requirement for the government of Guam to mirror the Internal Revenue Code. This will directly impact the rates, deductions, and credits paid by Guam tax filers and, unlike the States, will also directly correspond to the revenues collected by our territorial government. This, Mr. Speaker, is the very definition of taxation without representation. So I cannot support the Republican tax plan because it ignores the impacts it would have on my constituents in Guam and the other territories, and it prevents the people of Guam from having a say, through their own representative in both the House and the Senate, in its development. I oppose, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1, and I urge my colleagues to defeat it. Vote ‘‘no.’’ 
WEALTHCARE ABOVE HEALTHCARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I always acknowledge the preeminent privilege to stand in the well of the Congress of the United States of America. It is a unique opportunity accorded few in a country of millions. So I am honored to stand here, Mr. Speaker. I love my country, but I must say, Mr. Speaker, I stand here with profound disbelief—profound disbelief—because I cannot believe, Mr. Speaker, that the Senate of the United States of America is considering removing 13 million people from insurance in a tax bill. The Senate is proposing in a tax bill—that can’t solve all of our problems, by the way—that 13 million people lose healthcare—13 million people without a primary care physician. Perhaps not all, but it is fair to assume that millions will not have a primary care physician. Millions will no longer get the preventive care that can save dollars as well as lives. Millions will find themselves in emergency rooms receiving primary care. I cannot believe that the Senate of the United States of America, in a tax bill, would remove 13 million people from the insurance rolls and, in so doing, acquire $338 billion. The $338 billion is not going to deficit reduction. The $338 billion will go to line the pockets of people who can afford the best healthcare that the world can provide. It is hard to believe that, in the richest country in the world, Mr. Speaker, we are about to move from healthcare to sickness care. Healthcare provides preventive care. Sickness care, Mr. Speaker, means that you show up at an emergency room. By the way, that $338 billion that is claimed as a savings—we will spend more than that on emergency room services for the 13 million—or the millions, whatever that number may happen to be—who are going to emergency rooms. We will spend it. People are going to get care. They won’t get the best care. We have, in the richest country in the world, concluded that we can take healthcare from those who dearly need it and provide wealthcare for those who already have it. Why would we put wealthcare above healthcare in the richest country in the world? I cannot believe that this is happening in the United States of America. By the way, Mr. Speaker, you and I know that if the Senate can do this, then the House will follow suit. The House will pick up that language, some variation of it, if not the exact language. We will find that, in the House, we will be voting to eliminate insurance for 13 million people. Mr. Speaker, our country is better than this. Our country is a country that cares for every person where, yes, we will care for the welloff, the well heeled, and the welltodo. Yes. But we also care for the least, the last, and the lost. In this country, we care about people, and we want every person to have the best healthcare. So I suffer from disbelief. I am thunderstruck. I cannot imagine the Senate removing 13 million people from healthcare to provide wealthcare for a few. 
HONORING MS. JEWEL BARKER ON HER 90TH BIRTHDAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RUSH) for 5 minutes. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, in this season of trying and tough times made even tougher by the skullduggery of the Republican Members of this body, I rise today to pay tribute to my personal hero and longtime friend, Ms. Jewel Barker, who recently celebrated her 90th birthday. Mama Jewel, as she is affectionately known to so many, was born November 3, 1927, in Solgohachia, Arkansas. She grew up in Wardell, Missouri, and attended Central High School in Hayti, Missouri, and later she attended the Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Mama Jewel always felt a strong drive to improve her life which led to her residing and working in Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri, before settling in our hometown of Chicago, Illinois, in 1956. Though she worked several jobs, her aspiration was to return to school to earn her teaching credentials. She attained this goal by receiving a master’s degree in education from the Chicago Teachers College and, in later years, a master’s degree from DePaul University in Chicago. Her love of justice for all people did not stop there. Her support for civil rights and equality culminated in her serving as ‘‘Mama’’ to the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party. During Mama Jewel’s 38 years as an educator, she served as a teacher, mentor, counselor, role model, and as a mother figure to many. She worked tirelessly, Mr. Speaker, with students and family members in programs that met before school, after school, and even on weekends. She provided housing and financial support for several young people so they could further their education. Mama Jewel’s passion has always been focused on helping others and encouraging people to realize their full potential. This led her to playing an active part in the civil rights movement, a role that she first accepted when she organized a boycott in 
Wardell, Missouri, in the 1950s, after its board of education failed to use money allocated there for indoor toilets in the AfricanAmerican school. Mr. Speaker, her passion for this cause was so great that Mama Jewel went door to door asking parents not to send their children to school, a decision that ultimately led to an installation of those very same toilets. Even after retiring in 1994, she volunteered her time and her talents at her former school and at other schools where her former students taught. In addition to her love for family and her love for service, Mama Jewel has always been a wellrounded enthusiast, displaying many of her talents and interests, which include sports, theatrical performances, cooking, and baking. To this day, Mr. Speaker, she remains very active in her church and in her community. I know I am so blessed to know Mama Jewel. I am so blessed that Mama Jewel poured her all into my late son Huey’s life. I am so blessed that she still is the matriarch of the family and of the movement. So on behalf of the citizens of the First Congressional District of Illinois, I would like to congratulate my friend, Mama Jewel Barker, on this milestone and wish her many, many, many more birthdays. May the Lord continue to bless Mama Jewel. May the Lord continue to shine His Shekinah glory upon Mama Jewel’s countenance and upon her family. 
TAX CUTS FOR MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS PAID BY WORKING FAMILIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I really do believe that the American people deserve a tax system that invests in our people and our community. We need to have enough income and enough resources to make sure we are fixing our roads, our bridges, and our transit. We need resources to invest in scientific research for families who are wondering about what the answers just might be for their loved ones who have Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s or whatever. We need to be able to defend our country. We need to be able to help people get a good education, healthcare, and housing. These are things that I believe are well worth investment in as a nation. Yet when we look at the Republican tax bill, we don’t see a bill that reflects the needs of the country to take care of our people. What we see is a mass distribution from working people—middle class people—to the wealthiest Americans in the country. We need a tax reform—a real tax reform—that protects retirement security for today’s seniors and future generations; that provides quality education, job training; that researches new medical cures and renewable forms of energy; and that supports our Nation’s children. Mr. Speaker, we need a tax bill that supports America’s families and that can help us do better and live higher quality lives. But, instead, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—a bizarrely named piece of legislation because it doesn’t do anything for jobs—is in front of us. It is what Republicans offer as tax reform. But here is what it does, Mr. Speaker: it moves more jobs overseas. This bill gives tax breaks to corporations offshoring jobs, driving down American wages. How many workers lay in the bed at night looking at the ceiling hoping and praying that the plant doesn’t close? How do we explain to them that we are going to cut taxes for these big corporations that would incentivize them to offshore? How do we tell them that? Is that making America great again? I don’t think so. It increases taxes for millions of Americans. Thirtyeight million middle class households will see an immediate tax increase—averaging $2,000 by 2026. Is that what we had in mind when we started talking about tax reform? Absolutely not. b1100 This Republican tax bill doubles taxes on American families by making folks pay Federal taxes on taxes you already pay to your State and local government. It is a good thing when local communities say: We are going to raise taxes on ourselves to meet local needs. When States and cities do that, they have been expecting for literally over 100 years that that would be deductible. Yet the Federal Government, under the Republican tax plan, wants to take that deduction away, which will have the effect of putting downward pressure on what local and State governments can raise to make their citizens’ lives better, beginning a downward spiral. As the Federal Government pays less, the States and cities will get less, and you will see services for people go down the toilet. At the same time, you will see money not trickle down but geyser up to the richest Americans. Double taxation will drive down home values and limit local governments’ ability to fund law enforcement—which is police, folks— schools, health services, and infrastructure. Medical expenses, Mr. Speaker. The GOP tax bill raises taxes on families who have children with expensive disabilities or adults who need expensive lifesaving treatment for longstanding disabilities because it eliminates the medical expense deduction. I had a lady named Carol, who is a senior, say: Look, I don’t know how I am going to make it without this. I need this. She met with me in my office just Monday, and she pleaded with me to fight this Republican tax bill, specifically on the elimination of medical expenses. But what about student loans? We live in a country where there is massive student debt, Mr. Speaker. If you are one of the 40 million people with student loan debt, you will no longer be able to deduct the interest you pay on these student loans, plus it eliminates the learning credits that make your tuition affordable. As we all know, if you are rich already, you don’t worry about student loan interest because you don’t borrow the money, you just pay it. But what about the middle class of America? What about the working class people of America? What about folks who really need it? Mr. Speaker, as I wrap up, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this Republican tax bill. It would have been nice to have real reform, but we are not getting it. Our only option is to eliminate this particularly sad piece of legislation. f 
GOP TAX CUTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York (Miss RICE) for 5 minutes. Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, a deficitexploding tax cut for the wealthy that will hurt middle class families in my district. I am all for real, bipartisan tax reform that puts the middle class first, but that is not what this bill is. This is a giveaway to the wealthy and big corporations. It adds trillions to the debt and pays for it on the backs of the middle class. Half of my constituents on Long Island deduct their State and local taxes, an average of more than $23,000. Under this bill, that disappears. Corporations can still deduct their State and local taxes, but individuals and couples cannot. That means many middle class families will see their taxes go up, while the vast majority of relief goes to the people who don’t need it: the wealthiest individuals and the biggest corporations. The National Education Association also found that eliminating SALT could lead to a $250 billion cut in education funding just in the State of New York over the next decade. Make no mistake: this bill won’t help the middle class. It will explode the deficit, and Republicans will try to pay for it with big cuts to healthcare, education, Social Security, and other important lifesaving programs. I urge my Republican colleagues to give up this trickledown fantasy and work with Democrats on real bipartisan tax reform that truly puts the middle class first. 
REJECT THE TAX CUT LEGISLATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Republicans are bound and determined to rush through this Congress an immense tax bill before Americans even begin to know what hit them. We need to speak up and inform families about this bill and its many bad parts. I came here to the House a few weeks ago and said: All you need to know about this tax bill is that it is good for Donald Trump and his billionaire buddies. It rewards those multinational companies that have been shipping jobs and profits offshore for so many years and who think they have no responsibility to pay for our national security and other vital public services. Well, I am here today to admit that I was in error. All of those things are true. It is about Donald Trump and his billionaire buddies and all the additional money they will pocket. It is about shipping the jobs offshore by multinationals who get a new incentive, a giant, new loophole in this bill, but I was wrong to say that was all that it is about. It also now begins to impact one family after another across America in their healthcare. It is the same fanaticism that drove Republicans to try to take away healthcare 60plus different times in the last Congress and the same fanaticism that has caused them to push forward with repeal effort after repeal effort. It is the kind of fanaticism that American citizens stood up to. It was not only the courageous votes of JOHN MCCAIN, SUSAN COLLINS , and other Members in the Senate who stopped this wretched healthcare bill that passed through the House, but it was the fact that Americans kept saying: No, don’t take the right that my family has to get access to a family physician. Don’t take away my neighbors’ or my church members’ right to get access to protect their family with healthcare. Today, we learn that this new tax bill is being changed to do just that. It is another assault on the Affordable Care Act. In the beginning of the rush to force it through the House long before Thanksgiving, before Americans even get to give it attention, the first step that Republicans took here in the committee that I serve on that considered the tax bill last week was on what we call the Alzheimer’s tax. Currently, American citizens have a right that has long existed in our tax law that if you have really serious medical expenses of over 10 percent of your income, such as a family who earns $50,000—which is now, today, a modest income—and they have over $5,000 in medical expenses, they can deduct those from their taxes. It is called the Alzheimer’s tax because so many of the families that rely on disability to deduct medical expenses are older people who have a family member with Alzheimer’s. They need longterm, special care, or they need someone with home health care to come and help them with this very serious problem. Under the bill that is before us today, they will be denied any right to continue to do that. Under this bill, they will get an opportunity to pay a tax on the dollars they are having to expend for Alzheimer’s care. Of course, it is not just Alzheimer’s care. It might be a young family that has a child with a serious disability who requires home health aides or physical therapy, or it might be a woman with breast cancer whose medical coverage does not provide all of the treatment that she needs. Under this Republican bill, you will no longer be able to deduct one cent for all those serious, burdensome medical bills. No, they want to tax you on what you paid in excess of medical bills. We have moved today to chapter two. The bill that the House will consider will be merged with a Senate bill. The Senate has declared they will end forever the individual responsibility portions of the Affordable Care Act. Those are the provisions that ensure all Americans will participate so that we will have the largest possible risk pool and that people don’t sign up for the Affordable Care Act just after they are sick, after they have a problem. Everyone is there. It is just like you don’t sign up for fire insurance after your house is on fire. It is essential for everyone. We must reject this bill as the wrong way for America to go to deny healthcare coverage and impose more taxes on too many Americans. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 9 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Dr. Glynn Stone, Mobberly Baptist Church, Longview, Texas, offered the following prayer: Thank You, Lord, for these times when our Nation has recognized her need for You. God, You are our help in ages past and our hope for years to come. You can see our trust in You is engraved throughout this very building. So before any speeches are heard or votes are cast or decisions are made, we recognize that our greatness comes only from Your grace. So I humbly ask You to remind each of these, Your servants, of their special responsibility, to lead in Your way, to lean on Your word, and to listen to Your voice. As they represent constituents, may they defend the defenseless, protect those in danger, and promote good, so that all Americans can reflect Your image and bring glory to You and accomplish Your will. Your providential hand has promoted us to these lofty positions and will assuredly judge our stewardship of these responsibilities. So we submit this day and ourselves to You, Jesus, my Lord. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JODYB. H ICE) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING DR. GLYNN STONE The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is with great joy that I welcome Dr. Glynn Stone to the House of Representatives today to serve as our guest chaplain. Dr. Stone serves at Mobberly Baptist Church in Longview as senior pastor, where he takes part in influencing others for Christ. He is husband to wife, Angie, and together, they have the joy of raising three awesome sons. Dr. Stone’s call to ministry began when he was 16 years old, serving in churches throughout the Tennessee Valley. Under Dr. Stone’s influence at Mobberly Baptist, several churches have been planted across the country as well as numerous mission trips across the world. Apart from his pastoral services, Dr. Stone has had the privilege of teaching at several colleges and universities, including Southwestern Seminary, Dallas Baptist University, and Shorter College. Knowing Dr. Stone as a friend and as a confidant is an honor and a privilege. His dedication to the church of Jesus Christ is something to be greatly admired, just as the vast number of our Founders did. He is a blessing to the multitude of people whom God has touched through him and his years of service to our Lord. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true servant to the people, Dr. Eugene E. Williams. He is a dedicated husband to his wife, Daisy, a wonderful father, grandfather, veteran, and pastor. Sunday will be Dr. Williams’ 59th anniversary as pastor of Mount Beulah Missionary Baptist Church in Ferriday, Louisiana. Over the course of his 59 year career, he has ministered to four other churches across Louisiana, which include Mount Sinai Baptist Church and Mount Olive Baptist Church in Ferriday, St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church in Jonesville, and New Hope Baptist Church in Ruston. In addition to his service as a pastor, he was a teacher, community organizer, and the director of the LaSalle Head Start program for 28 years. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Williams is a model citizen for the people of the Fifth District of Louisiana, and I would like to thank him for his selfless service to the community and for making my State a better place. 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the Republican tax bill. Mr. Speaker, how much can the American people take? How many alternative facts will we ask them to believe? How many broken promises will we ask them to overlook? The proposed tax bill is camouflaged as a tax break for the middle class, but you and I both know the only permanent tax breaks are for the richest people and corporations in America. As a matter of fact, over 36 million families will see a tax increase. Now, there is a new flimflam on the table. Mr. Speaker, you are well aware that Republicans have voted over 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. All attempts failed. But now a repeal of the mandate that all Americans have healthcare has mysteriously been added to the tax bill. Is it possible that tax reform is just a ruse to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Enough is enough. Mr. Speaker, I believe the American people are paying attention, and I believe the American people will hold those accountable who vote against them. 
HONORING ERNEST WALLS ON HIS INDUCTION INTO THE GEORGIA MILITARY VETERANS’ HALL OF FAME (Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable individual from my home district, Mr. Ernest Walls of Monroe, a 93yearold World War II veteran who was recently inducted into the Georgia Military Veterans Hall of Fame. Private First Class Walls joined the U.S. Army in the midst of World War II at the age of 18. In a display of incredible valor, under the 22nd Infantry Unit, he was part of the wave of troops to storm Utah Beach, the westernmost beach of the five landing areas of the Normandy invasion, where they fought their way across a killing zone without hesitation. He was later wounded and captured by the Germans. He spent a year as a prisoner of war. When asked about his heroic action, he said: ‘‘Only the grace of God helped us win the war, and America came back as the most blessed and most powerful Nation on Earth.’’ Due to an unfortunate clerical error, it took Mr. Wells nearly 55 years to receive his POW status and full benefits. Thankfully, since then, he has been rightfully awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, French Legion of Honor, and Prisoner of War Medal. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Private Wells and to extend our personal and sincere appreciation to him, as well as all our men and women in uniform. We, as a nation, are forever grateful. f 
WHY THE HURRY? (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the tax bill. Again, we find ourselves faced with a bill that will impact every American, but my Republican colleagues are rushing through. They won’t even wait for the Congressional Budget Office to show us what the cost will be, to assess what this bill will do to our economy, to our children and our grandchildren. Why the hurry, Mr. Speaker? Is it in hopes that Americans won’t notice the repeal of the estate tax, a tax that only applies to people so wealthy that entire States don’t have someone affected by it in some years. Is it so that Americans won’t notice that this bill repeals the State and local tax deduction for families, but not for businesses? Or is it so that Americans won’t notice that it won’t tax businesses earning income abroad, but it does tax individuals working abroad? Eighty percent of the tax cuts in this bill go to the top 1 percent of Americans. Republicans may pretend to hope that the money will trickle down to the average American, but we know it won’t work. Trickledown does not work. MEDIA WANTS TRUMP TO FAIL (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Pew Research Center recently studied how the media covered the first 60 days of each recent administration. Not surprisingly, 62 percent of the media coverage of President Trump was negative, compared to 20 percent for President Obama and 28 percent for Presidents Bush and Clinton. As Investor’s Business Daily put it: ‘‘The media from the getgo had decided Trump was a bad President—before any of his policies had a chance to take hold.’’ Now that his policies have taken hold and improved the economy, the media still does not want President Trump to succeed. You have seldom heard or read a word about our strong economic growth, the recordbreaking stock market, high consumer confidence, and the recordhigh household income. The liberal media seldom highlight this news because they would have to credit President Trump’s successful policies. When the liberal media give the American people the facts and present the news objectively, they will have earned our trust. Until then, they just serve as another biased source of information. f 
CORPORATE TAX CUT SHOULD BE REJECTED (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, New York State contributes $41 billion, annually, to the Federal Government in taxation. The House Republican corporate tax bill cut is being funded by tax increases on middle America and on western New York. The elimination of the State and local tax deduction would be a major hit on local taxpayers. In fact, in Erie County, 89 percent of middleincome households claimed the State and local tax deduction in 2015, deducting $1.6 billion in alreadypaid local taxes. The average State and local tax deduction in Erie County was $12,866. This corporate tax cut is being funded by tax hikes on middle America and on western New Yorkers and should be rejected. 
TAX CUTS (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, this is a historic week, one that has been 31 years in the making. In a onceinageneration vote, we will vote to cut taxes for the middle class and unleash the power of the American economy. Our Tax Code is more than 70,000 pages of opaque rules and regulations 
that cost Americans money and jobs. In critical ways, our Tax Code gives explicit economic advantage to our foreign competitors. That changes with this bill. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act puts the American taxpayer and the American economy first. The bill cuts taxes for individuals and families in every tax bracket. By lowering rates, doubling the standard deduction, and increasing the child tax credit, hardworking American families can keep more money in their paychecks. The average family of four earning $55,000 will see a tax cut of over $1,000. This bill will supercharge our economy by making everyone play by the same rules. It substantially reduces taxes on small businesses and manufacturers. This means more jobs, more money, and more opportunity for American workers. Tax reform is the single best thing we can do for our economy. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill. 
REPUBLICAN TAX SCAM (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, just calling this tax bill a middle class tax bill does not make it so. You actually have to read the bill. And if you do, you will find that the vast majority of the benefit goes to the people at the very top: the wealthiest Americans, multinational corporations. They are the beneficiaries of this Republican tax scam. Saying it benefits the middle class does not make it so, and, in fact, many in the middle class, tens of millions of people in the middle class, will pay more taxes so that we can do what? Give huge tax breaks to the people at the very top. And how do they pay for that? They borrow money. All these deficit hawks, all these people over here who have said over and over again that it is immoral to pass debt on to our children and grandchildren will walk to the floor of this House and they will vote to send $1.5 trillion in debt to their kids and grandkids to give corporations and the wealthiest Americans a tax break. It is immoral. It is immoral. 
RECOGNIZING THE FREEDOM 5K FOR PTSD (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an exciting event at Penn State that raises awareness about veterans who suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder. The Freedom 5K for PTSD is the brainchild of some of Penn State’s cadets. Nicholas Pisciotta organized the 2016 run, and Joshua Stein organized this year’s event. Mr. Speaker, these dedicated cadets said they felt it was important to take care of the men and women who have fought for our country and are still fighting for the freedoms that we enjoy today. The proceeds from the event support the Lone Survivor Foundation, which provides support for wounded servicemembers, their spouses and children, by empowering them with helpful information on how to address posttraumatic stress, mild traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, military sexual trauma, and care partner stress. The Freedom 5K also honors the spirit of Navy SEAL Lieutenant Michael Murphy, a Penn State alumnus, who made the ultimate sacrifice as part of Operation Red Wings. Mr. Speaker, I commend these current and future servicemembers for not only organizing this impactful event, but for caring about their fellow military men and women. f 
b1215 HOUSE DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON BETTER JOBS, BETTER WAGES, AND A BETTER FUTURE (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, while House Democrats continue to focus on better jobs, better wages, and a better future for the American people, House Republicans have put forward a phony, fraudulent, and fake tax reform plan. The Republican tax scam will raise taxes on 36 million middle class families, undermine Medicare, and explode the deficit. It will saddle our children and grandchildren with more than $1 trillion in additional debt simply to pay for massive tax cuts for millionaires, for billionaires, for special interest corporations, and for the privileged few. It is all being done simply to subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. It is a Ponzi scheme. It is a heatseeking missile aimed directly at middle class families. It is a flimflam, and it must be defeated. 
CONSTRUCTION TO LOWER YELLOWSTONE INTAKE PROJECT MUST BE COMPLETED (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, for 110 years, the Lower Yellowstone Intake Project has provided a dependable supply of water to over 58,000 acres of family farms in Montana and North Dakota. It has created over 10,000 acres of wildlife habitat. To protect the endangered pallid sturgeon, Congress funded a bypass channel and weir improvement so that the fish could circumvent the diversion that had been there for 110 years. The proposed construction would also protect regional groundwater, the environment, and agricultural communities. Unfortunately, a U.S. district judge blocked the project this summer because, as he claims, it does nothing for the sturgeon. His ruling to halt construction does nothing to help the sturgeon. His ruling does nothing to help the communities that rely on the project’s irrigation water. I urge the Army Corps of Engineers to move forward with the work on the Lower Yellowstone Intake Project. The completion of this project is urgent to protect species’ habitats and agricultural activities in Montana. f 
THE STORY OF HUGO FROM SALEM, OREGON (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Hugo from Salem, Oregon, and I continue to urge Speaker RYAN to put forth a clean Dream Act. Hugo is an undocumented Oregonian originally from Veracruz, Mexico. His only memory of Mexico is saying good bye to his parents as a child before leaving for Salem. In high school, Hugo played football, he was a JROTC commander, a youth police cadet, and a firefighter explorer. He quickly moved from ESL into honors classes, and graduated at the top of his class. Hugo earned the privilege of delivering the commencement speech at his graduation. All of this, along with his dedication to community service, led to the city of Salem recognizing Hugo as Youth of the Year. Because of Hugo’s immigration status, however, after leaving high school, his only job was a field hand. That is until DACA. Hugo was able to enroll at the University of Oregon, working multiple jobs to pay for his tuition, and earned his bachelor’s degree in economics. He now works as a banker, and volunteers as a teacher in financial literacy for families. But in 10 months, his work permit will expire. Mr. Speaker, let’s protect 800,000 DACA recipients across this country, like Hugo. 
THE 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM ACT IS NEEDED REFORM (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, a wise man said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. The definition of public bankruptcy is not having enough public taxes to pay public debts. 
This means that the current National Flood Insurance Program is both insane and bankrupt. It is insane because taxpayers pay when others’ homes are flooded. They pay again when the same homes are flooded a second time and a third time and a fourth time. The GAO confirmed that the National Flood Insurance Program has created a flood of taxpayer debt; $23 billion in March of 2016. Three recent major hurricanes on the Gulf Coast doesn’t help. Because Texas 22 had record floods when Hurricane Harvey hit in May, I was proud to be one of 237 Members to vote for needed reform, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act. Mr. Speaker, I urge my Senate colleagues to do the same. Give America a Christmas present before Santa Claus comes to town. 
LET’S WORK TOGETHER TO CRAFT A TAX REFORM BILL (Ms. TSONGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on H.R. 1, the socalled Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Republicans say will support America’s middle class. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Middleincome Americans will receive, at best, onefifth of the promised benefit of these tax cuts. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, H.R. 1 will raise taxes on 36 million hardworking middle class American households. It scraps benefits our families depend on, like the student loan interest and medical expense deductions. Imagine, in a time when access to higher education is critical to a family’s economic wellbeing, making it even more expensive. This legislation was written behind closed doors, in secret, without Democratic input and without any hearings. Mr. Speaker, a bill to overhaul the Tax Code, the results of which will affect every American for decades to come, deserves open and transparent consideration. I urge my colleagues to work together to instead craft a tax reform bill that truly lifts up the middle class and invests in our future. 
THANKFUL FOR CHANGE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as we approach Thanksgiving 2017, I am thankful for the change since election 2016 and the positive success of President Donald Trump and Vice President MIKEPENCE to cut taxes to create jobs. In the House, led by Speaker PAUL RYAN, there have been records set on productivity. As of this week, there have been 458 bills passed out of committee, more than the last five administrations; 407 bills passed out of the House, more than the last five administrations; and 82 bills signed by the President. There is progress for limited government and expanded freedom. President Trump has also restored trust in America as a beacon for freedom with his strong friendship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, and President Emmanuel Macron of France. He has championed liberty with 50 Muslim nations in Saudi Arabia, with stunning tributes in Warsaw and with the National Assembly in Seoul this week. President Trump’s success in creating jobs is clear with the Dow Jones, achieving 50 new highs and soaring. Consumer confidence is at a record high, establishing 261,000 new jobs in October alone. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. f 
THE GOP TAX PLAN (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues have gone too far. Their tax scheme gives $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires as well as wealthy corporations. It raises taxes on 36 million middle class families; makes deep cuts to Medicaid and Medicare, education, and infrastructure investments; and creates more incentives to ship American jobs overseas. Now they are planning to sneak in a provision that targets the heart of the Affordable Care Act and strips more than 13 million Americans of their access to healthcare. This is not a tax reform plan. It is a tax scam. Democrats and Republicans should be working together to fix an economy and a Tax Code that is rigged against working people. The American people need real tax reform that invests in middle class families, stops corporations from shipping jobs overseas, and protects Medicare and Medicaid and other vital investments in healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, this bill does just the opposite. It deserves to be defeated, and the American people deserve a better deal. 
RECOGNIZING THREE NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS IN MICHIGAN (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here today to recognize three National Blue Ribbon schools in my district. Each year, the Department of Education recognizes some of the top schools from across the United States. The Blue Ribbon award is a remarkable achievement that recognizes the outstanding work done by exceptional educators and the hard work of dedicated students. I would like to congratulate Hamlin Elementary School; Brewster Elementary School; and my own alma mater, Rochester Adams High School, for being recognized as being some of the best educational institutions there are. I know this personally, as two of my children attend Rochester Adams High School. From my experience with these schools, what sets them apart is the teachers don’t wait to generate enthusiasm for learning. Each and every student is empowered to do things for themselves, to take on challenges, to push their minds, and to think of things in different ways. All of these schools are exceptional and are filled with the love of learning and are devoted to preparing students for all stages of life. All three schools serve the Rochester community and my hometown of Rochester. Mr. Speaker, congratulations again to all these outstanding schools. Their selfless devotion to their students is something for which we all can take to heart. Our children are our future, and these Blue Ribbon schools are committed to making it a bright one. f 
ROLLINS DEMOCRACY PROJECT IS A SUCCESS (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, in a nationwide competition, Rollins College achieved one of the highest student voter turnout rates in the 2016 Presidential election. I want to recognize the hardworking students and faculty at the Rollins Democracy Project for this accomplishment, which reflects the school’s commitment to preparing the next generation of engaged citizens and global leaders. As Justice Brandeis once observed, the only title in our democracy superior to that of President is the title of citizen. Our democracy withers when our citizens are disengaged from and cynical about the political process. However, it is strongest when our citizens are engaged and informed. Our democracy works best when our citizens use their voice and their vote to hold elected leaders accountable. It thrives when our citizens understand that, while the right to vote is sacred, it is only powerful if it is exercised. Mr. Speaker, that is why what this school accomplished is so important and why I am so proud to represent Rollins College in Congress. 
IT IS TIME FOR CONGRESS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE’S INDIVIDUAL FORCED MANDATE (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise President Trump and my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate for coming together to develop the first major tax reform plan that our Nation has seen since 1986. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we are considering is going to deliver real tax relief to middle class families and small businesses. However, there is more work to be done. Here in the U.S., we don’t settle for good enough. Congress can make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act even better for the American people by including a repeal of ObamaCare’s individual mandate. No American should ever be forced to purchase something that they don’t want. That is not freedom. That is not the American way. For 3 years now, Federal Government bureaucrats have forced Americans to purchase insurance they can’t afford and don’t want. Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to repeal ObamaCare’s individual forced mandate. 
b1230 DEPORTATION OF VETERANS (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, most Americans would be outraged to learn that hundreds, if not thousands, of veterans have been deported after serving honorably in the United States military, but this is the shocking truth about our broken immigration system. These unjust deportations of veterans are still occurring. Let me cite the case of Chong Hwan Kim, a South Korean immigrant who has lived in this country since he was 5 years old. In 2009, he was deployed to Iraq and was honorably discharged a year later. Legal permanent residents qualify for citizenship if they serve just one day on Active Duty during a time of war. Suffering from PTSD and facing the same challenges that many veterans face reintegrating into society, Kim broke the law, and because he never completed the process of becoming a citizen, he currently awaits deportation. Veterans like Chong Hwan Kim deserve better. They deserve the dignity and respect that we afford to all who serve, and they deserve to enjoy the rights they risked their lives to protect. 
HONORING MAGGIE M CNEILL OF ASHE COUNTY (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to salute a brave, dedicated nurse of Ashe County, North Carolina, Mrs. Maggie McNeill. Recently, the Fifth Congressional District of North Carolina experienced torrential downpours and flooding, causing severe damage to many residents and their property. Mrs. McNeill, scheduled for her shift at Ashe Memorial Hospital, found her car’s path blocked by flood waters and a downed tree. Undeterred by this danger, Mrs. McNeill hiked on foot up a steep hill to her helpful father who gave her a ride to the hospital in time to help deliver two babies. What a fantastic role model Mrs. McNeill is. She understood she was needed, and she risked herself to get to her patients. She exemplifies the best characteristics of Americans. Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for many when I say that future generations of the Ashe County community are blessed by Mrs. McNeill’s dedication to her calling. f 
OPPOSING THE TAX BILL (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Republican’s tax scam that has been jammed through this Chamber without normal order, without public debate, and without consideration for our Nation’s future. I represent the heart of Las Vegas, a city that was one of the hardest hit during the financial crisis. Many of my constituents are just beginning to recover from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and this tax bill will greatly hinder their progress. Some 20 percent of my constituents itemize their deductions, the vast majority of whom earn under $75,000 per year. These families will all see a tax hike if this bill becomes law because the deductions for student loans, medical expenses, sales tax, and some mortgages will all disappear. The sad reality is, they won’t just feel the hit on April 15, tax day. They will feel it every single day. The deficit that this bill will create will lead to State and local governments missing out on needed Federal funding, and they will either have to slash vital programs or raise taxes at that level. If the Senate has its way, they will cut Medicare by $25 billion and repeal the ACA. This is not a tax reform. It is a system that will be rigged. 
NATIONAL ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH AND FINDING A CURE (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of November as National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month and to highlight the need for continued funding to find a cure. In 1983, when President Reagan designated this month to help raise awareness for Alzheimer’s, there were less than 2 million Americans who suffered from this disease. Today, there are nearly 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer’s. Finding a cure to this disease is a smart health policy decision we can make, and it might also be the most critical economic proposal. The cost of caring for Alzheimer’s patients in the U.S. was estimated to be $236 billion in 2016, which is more than $200 billion greater than the total funding for research provided by the NIH for all diseases. Investments in research have led to some great news in Kansas. The University of Kansas announced that it will participate in the trial of a new drug intended to prevent or delay Alzheimer’s. Further, KU researchers are continuing to work on other preventative studies. Mr. Speaker, as we must continue to provide resources that we need to find a cure for this disease, I am proud of the work being done at KU and across the Nation. We will continue to be relentless in our fight to cure Alzheimer’s. f 
DEPORTED VETERANS (Mr. VARGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of veterans of the United States Armed Forces who have been unceremoniously deported. In the 1990s, the immigration law changes eliminated judicial discretion and reclassified many lowlevel, nonviolent offenses as aggravated felonies mandating deportation. As a result, the United States has banished an unknown number of veterans. In many cases, these were minor offenses committed by veterans who succumbed to the difficulties of readjusting to civilian life. Many are combat veterans who sustained physical wounds and emotional trauma in conflicts going back to the war in Vietnam. This banishment effectively denies these men access to often critically needed medical care. Regardless of immigration status, all U.S. military veterans are entitled to treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities, yet very few of these deported veterans are granted the necessary waivers to access the care either in the States or abroad. In fact, most of these veterans, the only way they are going to return is in a box, dead, because they do have the right to be buried in a veterans’ cemetery. Let’s do the right thing and bring these veterans home so they can get the care they need. 
INDIVIDUAL TAXES WILL NOT GO UP (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you a letter that was received in the Rules Committee last night. It is a letter actually addressed to Chairman KEVIN BRADY of the Ways and Means Committee. It is from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It is a long letter. I will not read all of it. Some of it is difficult to understand, but let me pick out the important points. In each case, the taxpayers’ total income tax liability is lower. Here is their concluding paragraph: 
In its totality, the combined effect of the tax rate and the income threshold and amendments made by the bill, along with the increase in the standard deduction, would not, in and of themselves, result in an increase in the amount of tax imposed on virtually any filer as a result of these changes. 
Translation: no one’s taxes go up; not 36 million; not 3,600; not 36. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, that number is zero, Mr. Speaker. 
SAVE HEALTHCARE, REJECT REPUBLICAN TAX BILL (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this wretched Republican tax bill threatens the health of millions. That is why Republicans are rushing this sham through in record pace. They want to pass it before most Americans know what has hit them. It is amazing that, on this Alzheimer’s Awareness Month, they celebrate it by imposing a new Alzheimer’s tax. Families paying thousands of dollars to care for a loved one would lose the right that they have today to deduct those huge expenses. It is not just a tax on Alzheimer’s, but on any substantial healthcare expense. As if that were not bad enough, they pursue with their fanatical zeal the destruction of ObamaCare. Again, they would remove one of the key pillars that will lead to denying coverage for those with preexisting conditions because their insurance premiums will soar. It will mean that millions of Americans will lose their healthcare coverage. Protect your health. Reject this sorry Republican tax bill. 
BRING DEPORTED VETERANS HOME (Mr. CASTRO of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank all those who have served our great Nation in the Armed Forces. On Veterans Day, we reflected on the sacrifices these brave men and women have made to keep us safe. Yet few Americans realize that U.S. citizenship is not required for military service, and even fewer know that our Nation has gone as far as deporting veterans. My colleagues and I in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus visited the Deported Veterans Support House in Tijuana, Mexico, to learn more about this issue. We heard stories about their service, deportation, and separation from family members. Ivan Ocon was born in Mexico and came to the United States when he was 7 years old. He enlisted in the Army after high school, ‘‘to serve the only country he knew to be his home.’’ Ivan deployed to Iraq, Jordan, and Korea and received an honorable discharge. Ultimately, he was deported to Mexico and had to leave his family behind, including his U.S.born daughter. Congress can and should pass legislation that brings these deported veterans home. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF STEVEN BERGER (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Steven Berger, a loving son, brother, and father of three. Growing up in Wisconsin, Steven was active in many sports. At 6′6″, Steven was a standout basketball player in high school and later played in college. Steven lived in Minnesota where he worked as a financial adviser and was a loving father to his three children. His friends and family describe him as charismatic, full of energy, and larger than life—the type of man who breathed life into every room. He was also an avid fisherman and loved talking about stocks and competitive sports. Steven traveled to the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas with friends to celebrate his 44th birthday. Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Steven Berger’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, November 15, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR.

With best wishes, I am, Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS. f 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1, TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT, AND PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM NOVEMBER 17, 2017, THROUGH NOVEMBER 24, 2017 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 619 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 619 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.

SEC. 4. The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed by section 3 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a) of rule I. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), my dear friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by saying that I would offer my thanks and collegial admiration and respect to the members of the Rules Committee who, last night, once again, on an expedited basis, spent time devoted to the duty that they have not only to their party, but also to the House of Representatives acting on behalf of the American people. The gentlewoman, Ms. SLAUGHTER ; the gentleman, Mr. HASTINGS ; the gentleman, Mr. POLIS; and certainly our friend from Worcester, Massachusetts, the gentleman, Mr. MCGOVERN , conducted themselves not only in the highest of spirit, but they also produced what I believe was a fair argument, a product that they could be proud of. Each of the witnesses that came before us, including Democratic Members of Congress and Republican Members of Congress, provided, I believe, topnotch testimony and information on behalf of their ideas. I personally want to thank Judge HASTINGS for his time last night, which was late into the night, and today. My admiration and respect for his collegial activity is to be respected and appreciated. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Last November, the November which was 1 year ago, the American people spoke, and they spoke clearly. I believe they stood up and demanded change and action on our economy. They demanded an increase in understanding about America’s lack in GDP growth, and they saw all across the country companies that continue to move overseas. They saw movement in our economy where people moved from one State to another seeking better opportunities. I believe that the American people have spoken. We not only heard that, but we are trying to make decisions now that would not only help every single area of the country by picking those businesses that might be in the city, in the town and location that they want to be, but by infusing them with the opportunity to stay, to stay because they can not only make a go of it, but they can be competitive in the world market. Lowering tax rates in this country will help the middle class of this country. It will help jobs and job creation. That is why we are here today. We are here today as a Republican Party where we are trying to work with the President of the United States, the United States Senate, and the House of Representatives to speak clearly about not only what we stand for, but our hopes and dreams for a better opportunity for all Americans tomorrow and in the future. Mr. Speaker, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivers on those promises that I just spoke of. This is a bold, progrowth bill that will overhaul our Tax Code and unleash the free enterprise system not just in my home State of Texas or in my city of Dallas, but, really, everywhere where business wants to be, it can flourish in an unfettered way because we are now going to be competitive. It lowers tax rates on all businesses of all sizes so job creators can focus on not only their product and sales, but they can hire more people, increasing paychecks and growth. Growth actually is the key to what we are talking about today. Economic growth brings abundant opportunity: opportunity for people not only to have a job, but to have a career, control their own lives and make sure they can live where they want to live and so they can make their community stronger. That is this Republican viewpoint of what we are trying to get at, Mr. Speaker. With the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, today’s broken Tax Code here in America forces many businesses to move their jobs, research, and headquarters overseas seeking opportunities in a world environment of competition where they can survive and they can become more competitive. A corporate tax rate of 20 percent encourages American companies to bring their jobs back to the United States, opening up opportunity. This decrease is fundamental to making the United States more competitive once again. The number one reason why America is not competitive in the world is no longer because of energy costs; it is no longer because we have the highest priced employees, no, sir. It is because Uncle Sam, State, and local taxes make it noncompetitive, which creates a higher cost as we compete around the globe. This legislation will modernize the international Tax Code, also bringing back opportunities for American companies that want to bring their profits back home and encourage U.S. businesses to bring foreign earnings home, unleashing what will be, over some period of time, trillions of dollars that can come back home. It reduces the tax burden on all passthrough businesses regardless of their structure or their sector. This legislation provides tax relief for job creators and creates capital investments, investments that will drive growth, once again, of paychecks and opportunities for growth. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a direct and immediate boost for middleincome Americans who have been struggling to get by, let alone get ahead. Mr. Speaker, you will hear today how we are going to have a new tax bracket. All Americans until they, as individuals, earn $12,000 and two working people at home earning $24,000 worth of income will not pay tax on that. It is intended entirely to help the middle class of this country. H.R. 1 is about the entrepreneur, the family of four, the smallbusiness owner, and the American people. The United States is already the greatest place in the world to live. We are proud to be Americans. But we have to be competitive in the world marketplace. Mr. Speaker, 70 percent of the tax benefits in this legislation go directly to the middle class. The American people want and need, I believe, to learn not only more about this bill, but how it will incentivize them to Make America Great Again. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the gentleman from Texas, my good friend, yielded me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Once again, my Republican colleagues have decided that the best way to govern is through obfuscation, mathematical gimmicks, and a rushed and closed process, and all in an obvious attempt to hide from the American people the devastating consequences the Republicanled tax scam bill will have on working class and middle class Americans. Just so we are all crystal clear on this point: Who, under this tax bill, benefits on the backs of working and middle class Americans? Yes, folks, it is the wealthy corporations and the richest among us. The Republican majority has made lofty claims about their bill, saying that because of this legislation, everyone gets a tax cut, jobs will be plentiful, and that the economy will grow exponentially and astronomically. The White House has even said that the tax cuts would result in each household receiving an additional $5,000 to $9,000 in annual income. Mr. Speaker, it seems there isn’t anything that Republican leadership won’t say to get their own Members to vote for this bill. Mr. Speaker, they can make all the claims they want, but the actual tax experts who have analyzed this bill paint a much darker picture about the consequences of this legislation. According to one nonpartisan tax analysis, today’s Republican plan will result in a tax increase for 38 million middle class Americans. Not to worry, though. While these hardworking middle class families have to deal with the tax increase, the richest 0.2 percent of Americans will get a windfall. In fact, the estate provision in this bill alone would allow the heirs of just 11 ultrawealthy individuals to pocket up to $67.5 billion. An estimated 80 percent of the tax cuts in this legislation will go to wealthy corporations and the richest 1 percent. 
Mr. Speaker, even more astonishing, a recent analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that this Republican tax bill could trigger automatic cuts to mandatory spending to the tune of $136 billion, including $25 billion in the Medicare cut. Let that sink in, because actually what is getting ready to happen here is we are going to have a $1.5 trillion deficit, and these deficit hawks on the other side are then going to turn right back around and say that we need to pay for these things. Then watch out Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, because that is the objective, in my view, in the first place. In order to cut taxes for the ultrawealthy and corporations, my Republican colleagues are not only raising taxes on the middle class, but are now potentially triggering a $25 billion cut to Medicare. If this inequity were not staggering enough, Americans also have to keep in mind that today’s Republican tax giveaway to corporate America and the ultrawealthy is not only on the backs of the middle class, but also future generations, as this bill will explode our national debt by an estimated $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. Not surprisingly, Republicans are making the tired excuse that these cuts will pay for themselves. If they did, then we would have the easiest jobs in the world. Just cut taxes, and magically we will have even more revenue to pay for the important needs of our country. That sounds a lot like the old trickledownwhichneverworked economics. It sounds that way to me, and we all know that as far as economic theories go, that one was and is a complete and total dud. Mr. Speaker, to summarize the majority’s attempt to overhaul our Tax Code for the first time in 30 years: they raise taxes on middle class Americans, cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, and manage to explode the debt all at the same time—all this while also leading the most closed Congress in history and shutting out Members of Congress who represent nearly half of the American people. Hear that, America: a lot of your Representatives had no opportunity to say or do anything regarding the measure that we are discussing. Mr. Speaker, let us step back and really get a full view of how callous this bill is for our Nation by looking at how the bill treats middle class Americans versus its treatment of the ultrawealthy and corporate America. Under this Republican tax scam bill, a working class schoolteacher who buys supplies for his or her students would not be able to deduct that expense, but a corporation that buys supplies for itself would be able to use such a deduction. Under this Republican tax bill, a middle class homeowner would see their property tax deduction capped at $10,000, but a corporation would not face the same cap. Under this Republican tax bill, if a worker was forced to relocate for his or her job—footnote there, including the military—because the company moved or, in the case of the military, they were relocated, he or she would not be able to deduct that moving expense; but if a corporation decided to relocate, even to relocate overseas, it will be able to deduct its moving expense. Mr. Speaker, the list goes on. But we shouldn’t be surprised. As the old adage goes, bad process makes for bad policy. Not since the Republicans’ failed attempt to strip healthcare away from millions of Americans have we seen a process that is this bad. Take, for example, the last time Congress passed major tax reform legislation in 1986 and what that process looked like. During that effort, the Ways and Means Committee held a month of public hearings and took testimony from over 450 witnesses. b1300 The legislation before us now has had no—zero—public hearings and testimony from no—zero—expert witnesses. During the last tax reform overhaul, the Ways and Means Committee spent 26 days marking up the framework of the legislation. This time around, Republicans spent only 4 days marking up the legislation. The 1986 legislation framework was released a year before it was passed in the House. In contrast, the framework for this bill was released less than a month before they started today’s process of jamming their final bill through the House. There were no hearings and no amendments made in order. From start to finish, there was less than a month of actual consideration. Much like the majority’s rushed healthcare processes that produced an abysmal, destructive bill that would hurt working class Americans, this rushed process has produced a tax bill that benefits corporations and the wealthiest Americans, all while managing to raise taxes on the middle class and adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority is lurching from one bad bill to the next with speed—not thoughtful policy—seemingly being the only goal. It begs the question: What is the rush? As a matter of fact, I don’t even think we need a tax bill of this consequence. According to them, the economy is roaring, unemployment is low, interest rates are low. So what is wrong with certainly leaving the wealthy in the category that they are in? Why are my Republican colleagues setting an arbitrary deadline of passing a tax bill by Thanksgiving, instead of focusing on thoughtful policy and getting the substance right in a bipartisan fashion? Everyone agrees that we need to do something about the Tax Code. Democrats have been ready to work with Republicans on this effort, but have been shut out of the process at every turn. Why? The only logical conclusion is that this has nothing to do with policy and everything to do with politics. It has nothing to do with helping the middle class, but instead is a callous political maneuver aimed at salvaging a stalled and everfailing Republican agenda. We are about to end the year with nothing having been done of consequence. Mr. Speaker, don’t take my word for it. This conclusion is not based on my own opinion. Some of my Republican colleagues have admitted as much. When asked about the need to move on to tax reform quickly, one of my esteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle was heard to say: ‘‘My donors are basically saying, ‘Get it done or don’t ever call me again.’’’ Likewise, on the other side of the Capitol, one Republican has stated that, if the Republicans fail on tax reform, just as they did on healthcare, financial contributions will stop. Mr. Speaker, I don’t think politics should dictate our efforts to reform something as significant as the Tax Code. Our guiding light should be to help working folks get a leg up. The only way to do that is to work in a bipartisan, deliberate manner, hearing from experts and the American people, as they did in 1986, and not as my Republican friends have done this time around, spending a mere 3 weeks, with no hearings, no bipartisan efforts, simply to give us something done before Thanksgiving. That approach only gets you what we have here before us today: a bill that, in my opinion, does more harm than good to middle class Americans and puts our country further into debt. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s observations. We don’t have 4
1⁄2 years to work through the process that he talked about. The American people want and need something done right now. I say to the gentleman that he is right, the economy is roaring—and it has been roaring since the day Donald Trump won the election—with an expectation of performance. Why are we doing this now? Why at Thanksgiving? Why at the end of the year? We are going to see that American business, as it makes plans for the future, is going to look up and say: We have got a better shot at keeping jobs here. We have got a better shot at being competitive here. I think what is going to happen is you are going to see this boom, this big opportunity that is already well underway, to continue. But it is up to us to deliver that. It will be one party. It will be those pesky Republicans that will get it done. We are going to get it done, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ), a member of the Rules Committee. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee for yielding. Today, the House of Representatives is considering tax reform for the first time since 1986. In the last 31 years, the world has changed a lot and it is time that we bring the Tax Code into the 21st century. This needed tax reform will put our country on a path to longterm economic stability and help hardworking families around the country get ahead. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help American families in important ways. First, it focuses on Americans in the middle of the earning scale by doubling the standard deduction and creating a new family flexibility credit for nondependents. Taxpayers will be able to deduct even more from their taxable income, reducing the need for tedious itemization. In addition, the bill repeals the alternative minimum tax. This tax was never intended to be as broad as it has become, but because it was not indexed for inflation when it was introduced, many of us find ourselves having to calculate our taxes twice to see if we are ensnared by the alternative minimum tax. It is time for this one to go away. With decreased taxation, American families have more money in their pockets, resulting in greater contributions to the economy. The bill also alleviates some of the cost of raising children by expanding the child tax credit. It preserves the adoption tax credit so parents can continue to receive additional tax relief as they open their hearts and their homes to an adopted child. This bill reduces the number of tax brackets from seven to four, with rates of zero, 12, 25 and 35 percent for most taxpayers. It does preserve the 39.6 percent rate of the previous administration for the highest earners. These reforms will help simplify the Tax Code and make it more competitive for hardworking American families. I am grateful the Ways and Means Committee kept the stepup in basis, despite repealing the estate tax by 2024. The stepup in basis is an important component of estate planning when people are planning for future generations. This will allow people who may experience a tragedy to continue ownership of family property without bearing excessive penalties. Mr. Speaker, I am a supporter of the flat tax. I have introduced H.R. 1040 in every term that I have been in office, but I recognize this bill makes a lot of needed reforms and repeals some credits while maintaining those important to American taxpayers. Donors will still be able to make tax exempt charitable contributions, employers will still be able to contribute to 401(k) retirement savings accounts, new homeowners will be able to deduct the interest expense on up to $500,000 of a mortgage, and no changes are made as to Social Security. I was actually hoping we could lower Social Security taxes. We couldn’t. But we certainly do not increase Social Security taxes, despite what some of the fake news says. Students will continue receiving a credit through the consolidated American opportunity tax credit. Simply put, this bill will promote growth at middleincome levels, create a more favorable business environment, and continue important tax credits. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ), a member of the Rules Committee. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my colleagues: What do you have against students? This tax bill means that if an employer provides tuition assistance, the student is going to have to pay income tax on that. Students who borrow money for school have to pay interest on the loan. Students who want to get low interest rates are going to have to pay high interest rates because of the elimination of the private activity bond. The second question I have is this: What do you have against democracy? This bill was written in secret. There were no public hearings on this bill. Nobody had a chance to have any input. That is why, if you ask 435 Members of Congress, if they want to raise taxes on students, the answer from 435 would be ‘‘no.’’ But you have rigged this bill so that we have literally no opportunity to offer a single amendment. That is wrong. This bill was written by and for the donor class. Let’s defeat this bill and stand up for the middle class. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. YODER ). Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair and not to other Members. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ), a member of the Rules Committee. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee, my friend, for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule as well as the underlying legislation, H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This legislation demonstrates a commitment to my constituents and all of the American people to provide relief. Our current Tax Code contains over 70,000 pages of rules and provisions. Within these pages are hundreds of loopholes and carveouts that only special interests can fully understand and access. At the very core of this legislation is a matter of fairness. By passing this rule and supporting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we will be making a profound reform of our Tax Code toward a system that is simpler, flatter, and fairer to American families across the country. According to analysis by the Tax Foundation, which is an independent, nonpartisan tax policy nonprofit, this legislation would stimulate GDP growth up to 4 percent and provide more than 3 percent of a wage increase. In my home State of Washington, it is projected that almost 22,000 new jobs will be created and a middle class family in my State is projected to gain over $3,000 in aftertax income, should this bill be signed into law. This means real and significant economic growth, with tens of thousands of new jobs in my State alone, and more money staying in the pocket of central Washingtonians. Mr. Speaker, I have been disappointed in the dialogue surrounding this legislation from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The accusations that this will be a massive tax hike on the middle class are patently false. Unfortunately, these claims are being made by Federal officials right here in Washington, D.C., all the way to my State capital in Washington State. In my congressional district, over 80 percent of the people file their taxes using the standard deduction. This bill actually doubles the standard deduction for middle class families and for all Americans. This allows families I represent in Moses Lake, Omak, and TriCities to save more money on their tax bill without having to jump through complicated loopholes and pore over their tax preparations for hours. However, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to acknowledge that fact. This bill lowers individual tax rates for low and middleincome Americans and continues to maintain the highest rate of 39.6 percent for the wealthiest of Americans. It eliminates special interest deductions, expands the child tax credit, establishes a new family credit for families taking care of a loved one, and it preserves the adoption tax credit. It allows a small business in Othello or a farmer in Yakima to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment. It repeals the unfair estate tax, which hurts family farms and small businesses. Mr. Speaker, the American people need relief, the people of central Washington need relief, and this bill provides it. I proudly rise in support of the bill. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), a member of the Ways and Means Committee. He happens to be a Democrat, so he didn’t have much input here. He is the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, only 1 minute? Well, one minute is longer than all of the hearings that have been held by 
Republicans on this sham of a tax bill that is so very broad in impact and so shallow in analysis. Only one minute? That is more than all of the Trump Administration officials who did not have the courage to come and face our committee and be questioned about this lousy proposal. b1315 Mr. Speaker, one minute? That is more time than all of the businesses in America and economists were given to explain the nature of these corporate giveaways. Why should a tax bill that is so broad get less time than it takes to microwave popcorn? Haste does make waste. This tax plan, born in the shadows and rammed through here 90tonothing will lay waste to family budgets, lay waste to affordable healthcare, and undermine our national debt. This tax scam must be rejected. They want it through here before the American people know what hit them, but if we speak out and remain firm in our resolve, we will defeat this sham of a bill. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ), a gentleman who participated for hours in the Rules Committee debate last night and is one of our most valuable young Members. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, those of us in Washington are really good at talking in big general statements that don’t mean much to the average American. I want to tell you what the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will actually do for the families I represent back in southwest Alabama. According to data from the IRS, almost threefourths of the tax filers in my district claimed the standard deduction instead of itemizing. Well, under our plan, the standard deduction will be doubled. Just consider the medium family of four in southwest Alabama. That family earns a little over $77,000 a year. If that family takes the standard deduction, as most do, they will see a tax cut of $1,739 a year. That comes out to almost an extra $150 a month. Now, that may not sound like real money in Washington, but for families in Bay Minette or Citronelle or Monroeville, that is important. That is extra money for a car payment. That is additional savings for a child’s college. That is money to help pay for home repairs. That is real money. When you add in the fact that we are fixing our corporate and business Tax Code to make it fairer and simpler, then we can truly make America boom again. President Trump has called it the ‘‘middle class miracle.’’ By making our Tax Code more competitive, we can unleash our full economic potential, bring jobs back to America, raise wages, and ultimately get more money in the pockets of working Americans. Mr. Speaker, this is exactly what President Trump promised and what the American people sent him and us to Washington to do. Now, my colleagues on the other side like to say this bill helps the 1 percent, and they vehemently defend the current Tax Code. You know who benefits from the current Tax Code? The 1 percent—people who can hire lawyers and lobbyists to help them get a special tax break, people who can spend thousands of dollars a year on specialty accountants. If you want to help the 1 percent, then keep the current complicated and confusing Tax Code that only helps the elite and well connected. We can do better than that. We can pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we can put more money in people’s pockets, and we can unlock America’s full economic potential. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, last night, I pointed out to my colleague from Alabama, whom I greatly admire, that he has a number of people claiming medical expense deductions who won’t be able to do so under this tax measure. The number of them, in fact, is 22,052, and the total amount claimed under medical expense deduction by them previously was $186 million. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), a distinguished colleague who I sit next to on the Rules Committee. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill. When I was growing up, I am sure, like most of us here in this body, I was fortunate to be surrounded by hardworking, dedicated teachers who cared about me, challenged me, and helped me succeed. Throughout our public schools in any State and across the country, there are teachers who are giving everything they have to help students thrive. Carolyn, a teacher from Louisville, is a great example. Carolyn shared with me how she spends her own personal money on school supplies for students who can’t afford to buy their own. To help mitigate this cost, there is a Federal tax deduction that allows teachers to get back up to $250 of their personal money they put towards supplies in their classroom, but the bill before us denies Carolyn and all of the other teachers that deduction and eliminates the tax benefits in the name of cutting taxes for wealthy international corporations. This bill also rolls back a critical education tax benefit that allows employers to provide up to $5,250 of tuition assistance, pretax. In practice, it encourages workforce training and apprenticeship programs. In fact, this very week is National Apprenticeship Week, and yet the Republican tax bill pulls the rug out from under businesses and workers, actually discouraging apprenticeships by stopping this tax benefit. Mr. Speaker, I was privileged to serve, before I came here, as the chairman of our State Board of Education and school superintendent. I wanted to be the ranking member of the Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education Subcommittee. I have really seen how important these tax benefits are to teachers and students. I offered amendments last night in Rules to simply restore these important tax credits for children. Unfortunately, in a partyline vote, my amendments were denied. These damaging provisions are just a small part of the overall harmful, misguided attempt at tax reform. Let us reset and let us begin a bipartisan discussion about tax reform that values education, educators, and kids. For this reason and so many others, I oppose the rule and the underlying bill, and I suggest a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, what a delight it is for me to stand up and say that, the work we are going to do today, the President of the United States will sign. He is encouraging what we are doing today. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter of support from the National Federation of Independent Business— that is ‘‘The Voice of Small Business’’ in America—and also what is called a Statement of Administration Policy from the Executive Office of the President of the United States. 
NATIONAL FEDERATION OF  INDEPENDENT BUSINESS , Washington, DC, November 14, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation’s leading small business advocacy organization, I am writing in support of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This legislation will provide much needed tax relief to America’s jobcreating small businesses. H.R. 1 will be considered an NFIB Key Vote for the 115th Congress. Small business is the engine of the economy, and tax reform should provide substantial relief to all small businesses so they can reinvest their money, grow, and create jobs. Ninetynine percent of all American businesses are small businesses; the average NFIB member has just 10 employees. Taken in sum, however, small businesses create half of all privatesector jobs in the U.S. and contribute half the nation’s gross domestic product. Threequarters of small employers are structured as passthrough entities, meaning their owners are taxed at the individual rate as opposed to the corporate rate. Crucially, H.R. 1 reduces the tax rate on the smallest passthrough businesses to 9 percent over five years, without industry exclusions or restrictions. NFIB supports passage of H.R. 1 and will consider it an NFIB Key Vote for the 115th Congress. Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to working with you to protect small business. Sincerely, JUANITA D. D UGGAN , President & CEO, NFIB. STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY  
H.R. 1—TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT —REP. BRADY , 
R–TX, AND 24 COSPONSORS  The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act. Passing the bill is an important first step in achieving comprehensive tax reform that cuts taxes for hardworking families and puts the Nation’s economy on a path of higher economic growth. The President’s priorities for tax reform have been consistent from day one: (1) cut taxes for middleincome families; (2) simplify the Nation’s complicated tax system; and (3) reduce business taxes so that American employers can create jobs, raise wages for their workers, and better compete with foreign businesses. H.R. 1 would deliver meaningful tax cuts for middleincome families by nearly doubling the standard deduction, lowering tax rates, increasing the child tax credit, and creating a new Family Flexibility credit. It would simplify tax filing so that the large majority of Americans could file their taxes on a single page. The bill would also cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent—below the average tax rate in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Finally, H.R. 1 would lower taxes for millions of S corporations, sole proprietors, and partnerships that pay taxes at individual rates. Based on a review of more than 100 academic papers, the White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) estimates that the corporate provisions in H.R. 1 would grow the economy by between 3 and 5 percent over the next 10 years, which if applied to 2027 Gross Domestic Product projections, would result in an additional $700 billion to $1.2 trillion in economic output per year. CEA also found that the same provisions would increase average household income by at least $4,000 annually. If H.R. 1 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the President’s priorities and tax reforms are consistent and have been from day one. Tax cuts for middle class families, simplifying the Nation’s complicated tax system, and reducing the burden of taxes so that American employers can create jobs, raise wages, and better compete with foreign businesses, that is what we are going to do. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, it is like old home week from the Rules Committee people. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MATSUI ), a good friend who used to serve on the Rules Committee. Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1. When I was home last weekend, my constituents shared how devastating this bill would be for them. A fifth grade teacher, Sarah, talked about how harmful the elimination of the deduction to purchase classroom supplies will be for teachers. She said: 
How out of touch do you have to be to cut a tax credit for public school teachers? 
A senior citizen, Mark, spoke about how devastating the repeal of the medical expense deduction would be for him and his wife with Alzheimer’s. How can House Republicans justify helping corporations over families in need? A father, Devin, who works two jobs to support his family, spoke about how he counts on the student loan interest deduction to plan for his future. He said: All I ask is that Congress keep the promise they made to us. We planned based on the promises they made. I hope they don’t break that promise. I hope they don’t make life a little bit harder on our families. 
How can Republicans defend making the lives of middle class families like his more difficult? To make matters worse, this bill will explode the deficit and lead to devastating cuts to Medicare. I ask my Republican colleagues to think about the families that will be hurt by this bill instead of prioritizing handouts to billionaires and corporations. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I am waiting for a speaker, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 11 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 12
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, like I said, it is old home week here with the Rules Committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR), another former member of the Rules Committee. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and thank him for being a champion for working families across the country. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule and the GOP tax bill because it is so fundamentally unfair. It is unfair that it raises taxes on tens of millions of middle class families while giving huge tax breaks to big corporations and the superrich. It does this, also, by adding over $1.5 trillion to the national debt. The Center for a Responsible Federal Budget said this is a step backwards for fiscal responsibility, largely because it passes the tab on to our kids and our grandkids. They estimate that that will cost about $12,000 per household, just the debt portion of it—not even a mention. Here is why middle class families get hurt: Republicans eliminate the deduction for medical expenses. That is over 630,000 Floridians in my home State. They eliminate the tax deduction that helps make college more affordable by being able to deduct the interest on your student loan. They eliminate all these deductions for the middle class and give all the breaks to the superrich and big corporations. It is fundamentally unfair, and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the bill. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ). Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this disastrous partisan tax plan that cuts rates for wealthy corporations and millionaires while leading to higher taxes for about 38 million working families. There is a lot to not like about this bill. It actually eliminates the student loan interest deduction. That will increase the financial burden for about 12 million Americans who are juggling their student loan debt with housing, groceries, and childcare. The cost of higher education is already out of reach for too many. We should be making it easier, not harder for Americans to access higher education. On top of that, removing the State and local tax deduction threatens funding sources for public education and will most certainly lead to cuts to America’s public school budgets. Mr. Speaker, across the country, families are working hard to get ahead. Let’s not take away their opportunity. We need a Tax Code that leads to better jobs, better wages, and a better future for America, for our children and our grandchildren. This bill fails the test, and we should reject it and get back to working together. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ), who served in the Pennsylvania Legislature and was chair of appropriations. He really understands this stuff. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity. I am not on the Rules Committee or the Ways and Means Committee, but I am on the Agriculture Committee. I think it is extremely important to recognize what Feeding America has expressed about this package. Feeding America has concluded that H.R. 1 will undermine efforts to assist those who struggle with adequate access to food. I strongly oppose that in a day and age where there is so much poverty and so much hunger across this country. We need to face up to the fact that we should oppose this because it goes in the wrong direction. But let’s be clear. The people who this bill will affect, too often, do not have a voice. I am here to be their voice. Enough is enough. This horrible bill needs to be stopped, and it needs to be stopped now. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ), a real champion and a mentor of mine. b1330 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, a picture is worth a thousand words, so is a graph. Following the blue line, the tax scam works this way: For average taxpayers, the blue line—the blue line is for blue and red States—shows taxes for individual taxpayers go down for one full year. Then look what begins to happen at 2019. They begin to go up. By 2020, they continue. Follow the blue line for average 
taxpayers. Their taxes are continuing to go up, they reach a real high, and steeply go up for the entire 10year period. For business tax credits, they go down, too. That means business taxes go down. And then they, too, go up. So the scam shows both look like they are doing the same thing, but 2024 is a dividing line. Then business income taxes plummet, but income taxes for average Americans go up. Who is paying for these business tax cuts? Individual taxpayers. Defeat this Republican tax scam. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ), my good friend. (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise, today, in strong opposition to this House Republican tax bill, which was developed in secret without a single public hearing. Despite repeated calls for Republicans to engage in a bipartisan process with Democrats, this bill was written without Democratic input and with enormous giveaways to wealthy interests. It makes you wonder, doesn’t it, Mr. Speaker? To pay for them, Republicans have eliminated critical tax provisions that are important to the middle class— such as deductions to medical expenses, for State and local taxes, for student loan interest, and other expenses—on which middle class families rely. What Republicans can’t pay for, they add to the Nation’s credit card to the tune of $1.7 trillion. Mr. Speaker, we are out to support this plan, but most Americans are only given the crumbs of this tax reform pie. Mr. Speaker, I cannot, in good conscience, vote for this bill. We need a fair and balanced tax reform package that helps everyday Rhode Islanders and that helps everyday Americans get ahead, not just the welloff and well connected. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), a gentleman who serves on the Financial Services Committee and a distinguished young Member of our majority. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we are considering today is the culmination of years of work, years of listening to the concerns of hardworking taxpayers at home, and several elections where the people spoke out for relief from a broken, specialinterest laden Tax Code. Here are the questions we need to be asking today: Are you tired of the status quo? Do you think we can do better than the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Do you want a healthier economy that creates the opportunities that offer you a real chance to get ahead, puts more money in your pocket, and helps you fulfill your American Dream? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is for you. As I travel across my district, I hear story after story from families with nothing left over at the end of the month, who are struggling to save for retirement, pay off loans, or simply make ends meet. It doesn’t have to be this way. There is a better way. We have a onceinageneration opportunity to fix this. We can act now to put more money back into the hardworking taxpayers’ pockets, make American business more competitive, and create a much healthier economy. Americans have toiled under a broken Tax Code filled with loopholes and special interest carveouts for far too long. This legislation—the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—is a giant step for everyday Americans looking to get ahead. This is for the family of four, making $59,000 a year, who can save $1,182 a year in taxes. This is for the single mom, making $30,000 working night and day to support her two children, who will also save more than $1,000 a year in taxes. Our legislation doubles the standard deduction, so people won’t have to itemize their tax returns. It expands the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600 and provides a $300 credit for adult dependents living at home. It will create more jobs in Pennsylvania and raise Pennsylvania’s families’ incomes. It will bring dollars back to America to be invested in American companies with American workers. It will empower the people of America who want to get ahead, and it will lessen the power of Washington, D.C. Vote for freedom, vote for prosperity, vote for this rule and this bill. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), my good friend. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and to the Republican tax scam. The biggest economic challenge of our time is that too many people who play by the rules are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. Wages are not keeping up with rising costs. Too many families today struggle to make ends meet. They have the rising cost of healthcare, of child care, and of housing. Meanwhile, big corporations, millionaires, and billionaires write the rules to make government work for them— and Republicans are their comrades in arms in rigging the game against the middle class. Enough is enough. It cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans, raises taxes on the middle class, and it increases the deficit. And worse, it encourages companies who outsource American jobs. Congress must put middle class families and jobs before corporations that have not been loyal to their employees and to our country. When you outsource jobs, you drive wages down here at home. Let me mention the child tax credit to you. The Republican proposal leaves behind vulnerable families—military families, rural families, large families, minimum wage workers, and those with the youngest children. Do not let them get away with this scam. This is not reform. It is tax cuts for the wealthiest, and I oppose it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 5 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 10 minutes remaining. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ), from the Ways and Means Committee. At this time, we are putting the Ateam up. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of the rule and the underlying legislation. Sometimes, in order to understand what is going on in the present and then what could happen in the future, you need to go to the past. Let me read something from a true IrishAmerican President who said: ‘‘Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget—just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. . . . ’’ ‘‘ . . . only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction can pave the way to that employment. The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.’’ I understand that there are differences of opinion on what we are trying to do, but, please, let’s talk about the facts. Let’s talk about a piece of legislation that is a rising tide that will lift all boats. We are going to cut taxes for every American at every income level. We are going to reduce taxes by almost $1,200 for every averagesized, middle income American family. This puts more money in the pockets of our families. I don’t care how they vote or how they registered. They are Americans. It reduces by almost $2,000 for every averagesized, middleincome family in Pennsylvania’s Third District. That is a $2,000 reduction for them. It will grow our national GDP by 3.6 percent. 
It will increase average American wages by 3.1 percent. In the long run, it will increase after tax incomes for American taxpayers by 4.4 percent. I also want you to think about what we talk about back home where I am from. We talk about takehome pay. ‘‘This is my takehome pay.’’ In Pennsylvania, Pennsylvanians—Republican Pennsylvanians, Democrat Pennsylvanians, Independents, Libertarians—are going to have about $2,700 more in their pockets after this legislation goes through. Let’s talk about jobs. Nobody spoke better about jobs than President Reagan when he said: It is about jobs, jobs, jobs, and more jobs. What is good for the American worker is good for America. This will create 1 million new American jobs. I want you to think about this: In the United States of America, we are now currently rated as the 23rd best country to do business in. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will change that. I want you to think about that. I am a hometown guy; I am a home team guy. It is hard for me to sit back and say that we have allowed ourselves to fall that far in the world when people think: Where should I start that business? Twentythird, are you kidding me? With all of the assets that we have been given by the Lord? And to sit here today and have an argument over something else other than that doesn’t make any sense at all. What we are trying to do with our tax plan is make sure that the United States just doesn’t participate in a global economy, it dominates a global economy, it leads the way in a global economy, it makes American workers stronger, it makes American families stronger, and it allows us to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. It allows everything good to happen. We cannot stay with the status quo. There is so much good in this bill for every single American. I did not say every single Republican, I said every single American. You can bat that one back and forth and try to make it a political story, but it is not. It is truly an American story. America has never dodged that responsibility. Now, let me read you one other quote, again, from an IrishAmerican President, who I hold in such great esteem, and one of the greatest people I have ever listened to. Let me read this to you. It says: ‘‘I do not underestimate the obstacles which the Congress will face in enacting such legislation. No one will be satisfied. Everyone will have his own approach, his own bill, his own reductions. A high order of restraint and determination will be required if the ‘possible’ is not to wait on the ‘perfect.’ But a nation capable of marshaling these qualities in any dramatic threat to our security is surely capable, as a great free society, of meeting a slower and more complex threat to our economic vitality. This Nation can afford to reduce taxes, we can afford a temporary deficit, but we cannot afford to do nothing. For on the strength of our free economy rests the hope of all free nations. We shall not fail that hope, for free men and free nations must prosper and they must prevail.’’ Think of who it is that we are. This is America’s house. Yes, this is a GOP tax plan, but it helps every single American. It is not a blue plan or a red plan; it is a red, white, and blue plan. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I will challenge you to go home next week for Thanksgiving and tell people all of the positives about this, and say: I am so sorry. I could have voted for that. It is time now for America to rise to the challenge. As I said earlier, we exist in a global economy. I am tired of being somebody who happened to participate, when we have the opportunity to dominate. Never before, in our history, have we had the chance to change the future for every single American. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair, not to other Members. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I will go home this week and tell people I voted against this horrible bill. And I will wonder if the last speaker would go home and tell the 11,249 people who utilize $131 million in medical deductions who will not have that under this bill, understanding that it could be different if they chose. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ), a newfound friend and a rising star. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and the underlying bill. This is a tax increase on the middle class, and it drops a ticking tax bomb on the American people. While it falsely claims to provide tax relief for working families and the middle class, in reality, it will raise taxes on 38 million Americans, and it will explode the deficit by over $1.5 trillion. b1345 A typical family in my district in Illinois would see their taxes increase by over $1,100. According to the CBO, H.R. 1 is so irresponsible, that it will result in an immediate $25 billion cut to Medicare. Americans recognize that incomes are not keeping pace with the cost of living, and parents question whether their children will have the same opportunities they had. Our constituents need responsible tax reform that strengthens the middle class and raises wages for working families. They do not need a tax increase, and this bill does just that. It increases taxes on the middle class. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this ticking tax bomb. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time until the gentleman has closed. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I am prepared to close and would advise the chairman of that regard. Mr. Speaker, a new Quinnipiac poll out yesterday shows the American people aren’t falling for the Republican tax scam. Only 25 percent approve of this plan, just 16 percent think it will reduce their taxes, and only 24 percent said the Republican plan will help the middle class the most. Mr. Speaker, we should listen to the American people, throw this dangerous plan in the trash can, where it belongs, and let’s work together on a bipartisan plan to help all Americans. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment that will prohibit any legislation from limiting or repealing the State and local tax deduction, which prevents millions of families from being taxed twice on the same income. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. First, my Republican colleagues attempted to jam an abhorrent healthcare bill through Congress. They failed. After that failure, they moved on to today’s attempt to jam an abhorrent tax bill through Congress. For the sake of middle and working class Americans, I hope my Republican friends ultimately meet defeat once again. Mr. Speaker, we set the record with this particular measure of 51 closed rules in this session, the most closed rules in the history of Congress. What that means is a lot of the Representatives who had good ideas, more than 100 of them that offered amendments last night, were unable to be heard because of closed rules. After this closed, disgraceful process, this Republican majority has presented, in this instance, a piece of legislation that skews tax cuts in favor of the ultrawealthy and rich corporations. Now, let’s make it very clear. Wealthy people shouldn’t be disrespected for their wealth, but I don’t know any wealthy people who are knocking down my doors, saying that they need a few more thousand dollars. But I know a lot of poor people who need a few hundred dollars, and this particular measure is not doing many of the things that would allow for them to be able to get on that last rung of that ladder and lift themselves up. I heard the gentleman say a rising tide lifts all boats. They had the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show, 
the largest one in the world, the week before last. All those yachts were lifted, but those little dinghies with the people fishing out in Lake Okeechobee were not lifted one doggone bit by this particular measure. This bill does so on the backs of middle and working class people and future generations. With this bill, the former deficit hawk Republican majority would add $1.5 trillion to the debt while potentially triggering $25 billion in cuts to Medicare. I might add that is where they are headed. Look out Medicare, look out Social Security, look out Medicaid. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Florida, Judge HASTINGS , for his exemplary work and the work of his colleagues on the Rules Committee and my colleagues also on the Republican side. Mr. Speaker, our previous speaker, the gentleman from Butler, Pennsylvania, MIKEKELLY , had it best when he said: ‘‘ . . . an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance our budget, just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. Only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction can pave the way to that employment.’’ What he did not say is—that will be in the record—is that John F. Kennedy said this on December 14, 1962, 55 years ago, in an address to the Economic Club of New York. Mr. Speaker, in fact, there have been a lot of people here who have given testimony, I think testimony that they intended to sway the voters and those listening in this country that the Tax Code that we have works just fine, but then they spoke about the frailties of that and they talked about jobs going offshore, they talked about jobs and economic activity going somewhere else. I, being from Dallas, Texas, hear stories every day about people who are coming to Texas, coming to north Texas, coming because of the economic climate that will allow them and their companies to have a better shot at not only being competitive, but, as MIKE KELLY said, to be winners in this economy, at the very top of the heap rather than at the bottom of the heap. What this common denominator is, is that my State of Texas does do the things that this bill does also. It keeps taxes low, it creates opportunity. By the way, how many poor people create jobs? I don’t know. How many of those who really have incentive and entrepreneurship create jobs? A ton of them. We are going to grow entrepreneurs out of today. We are going to grow young people getting out of college, veterans leaving the military coming back and seeing where they can make a go of it. Instead of it being a 95 percent failure rate of new business—which is what it is, it is a heavy bar because of rules, regulations, and taxes—we are going to make it easier. The White House Council of Economic Advisers based their review, as they provided the economic outlook to us, on more than 100 academic papers, estimates that corporate provisions in this tax bill alone will grow our economy, not leave us in 23rd place, as MIKE KELLY said. Who wants to be in 23rd place? If you want to be in the top 25 and you are comfortable, sorry. We want to be at the top. We want to Make America Great Again. We want to be able to say that businesses all over the United States stand a chance, and that is what this does. The Council of Economic Advisers says that this will grow the economy between 3 and 5 percent. Whoops. They got comfortable with 1.2 over 8 years. I am not comfortable and the American people aren’t comfortable either. We are going to add some $700 billion to the economy this next 10 years. That is the guess, that is what Republicans want to do, but it is based on a lot of factors, it is based on hard work. America has the best, most innovative workers in the world. We want to put this together with an opportunity, because we have a great place to be: the United States of America, any of our States. We have the best energy policies in the world and we have the best price. We have the best workers. We have tool kits with our universities. Our industry will grow back and reinvest in themselves. We are going to take our Tax Code and take what is $5.6 trillion worth of tax areas and move that where it will boost our economy. We will become pro growth again. Yes, we heard that it was John F. Kennedy, it was Ronald Reagan, and it is going to be making America great again. Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation in order to boost middle class Americans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to the Rule for Rules Committee Print 115–39, to H.R. 1, ‘‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.’’ The underlying bill will cut funding for programs that the American people need by $5.4 trillion over 10 years. It will raise the deficit by $2.2 trillion 10 years. This is bad for America. The chief motivation for House Republicans brings this bill before the House is to say they had a win before we break for the Thanksgiving Holiday. This rule if adopted will allow the House to take up consideration of a bill that will cost taxpayers because it: Eliminates the $4,050 personal exemption allowed to each taxpayer for their self, spouse, and each dependent child; Raises the lowest individual income tax rate from 10 percent to 12 percent Reduces the tax rate corporations pay on existing offshore profits from 35 percent to 10 percent; and Cuts the corporate tax rate paid by large companies. The Jackson Lee Amendments to Rules Committee Print 115–39 were offered as means of improving the bill: (1) The first Jackson Lee Amendment would delay the effective date of all revenuereducing provisions in H.R. 1 until the Secretary of Homeland Security submits to Congress a report certifying that the areas covered by Presidential Natural Disaster Declarations for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have fully recovered economically, as measured by a gross domestic product that exceeds by 10 percent the gross domestic product for such areas in the fiscal year preceding the Presidential Disaster Declaration; and the deficit is zero. (2) The second Jackson Lee Amendment would delay the effective date of all revenue reducing provisions in H.R. 1 until the Secretary of Health and Human Services submits to Congress a report certifying that the number of U.S. adults without health insurance has not exceeded five percent for three consecutive quarters; and the deficit is zero. (3) The third Jackson Lee Amendment preserves current law for deductions of student loan interest and other educational incentive. (4) The fourth Jackson Lee Amendment preserves current law for taxpayer deduction of mortgage interest. Our work should be focused on lifting people up and not taking opportunities away. The $4,700 standard deduction for families will be eliminated by the bill governed by this rule to give a tax cut to corporations. The recovery from Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma which impacted the Texas, Florida, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico have long gone, but the efforts of people to reclaim their lives continues. These families will need that $4,700. In the State of Texas Hurricane Harvey is on record as the worst disaster to hit homeowners in the United States with over 148,000 homes and 163,000 apartments just in Houston impacted. There are still 9,100 families in hotels and are in need of assurance that they will be able to return to their own homes. We know that the costs of recovery will far exceed any natural disaster in memory. We should set a national goal for extending health insurance coverage not looking for ways to destabilize the health insurance marketplace. Because of the Affordable Care Act in the state of Texas: 3.8 million Texas residents receive preventative care services. 7 million Texans no longer have lifetime limits on their healthcare insurance. 300,731 young adults can remain on their parents’ health insurance until age 26. 5 million Texas residents can receive a rebate check from their insurance company if it does not spend 80 percent of premium dollars on healthcare. 4,029 people with preexisting conditions now have health insurance. Today, insurance companies are banned from: 
discriminating against anyone with a preexisting condition charging higher rates based on gender or health status enforcing lifetime dollar limits enforcing annual dollar limits on health benefits Savings for Texas Seniors on Their Prescription Drugs, Thanks to ACA: Total Savings: $551,694,997 Total Gap Discount Amount: $201,876,665 Total Number of Beneficiaries: 233,114 Average Discount per Beneficiary: $866 Congress should support expansion of access to healthcare because it will save lives and relieve suffering of those who would otherwise not have care when they need it most. Our nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. Growing demand for rental housing has resulted in higher rents. More families than ever before struggle to pay their rent each month, and every Congressional district and state across the nation is impacted. The federal should continue its investments in homeownership that reduce homelessness and housing poverty are sorely underfunded: Just one in four low income families eligible for federal housing assistance receives the help they need. Comprehensive tax reform provides one of the best opportunities to end homelessness and housing poverty once and for all. As Congress considers comprehensive tax reform legislation, we urge you to seize this opportunity by reinvesting any savings derived from changes to the mortgage interest deduction into rental housing solutions for people with the greatest needs—not to offset the cost of tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations. In doing so, we can make the critical investments that our nation needs to help America’s families, our local communities, and our national economy thrives. We know the key to reducing poverty and increasing economic mobility is access to safe and affordable homes. Increasing access to affordable homes bolsters child and family success, economic growth, wages, and productivity. And each dollar invested in developing and preserving affordable homes boosts local economies by leveraging public and private resources to generate income—including resident earnings and additional local tax revenue—and supports job creation and retention. Congress as in the past should continue to champion homeownership because the benefits that comes to families and communities. Our nation should be reinvesting these housing dollars into deeply targeted programs that serve people with the most acute housing needs. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following letter from Thomas Barthold to Chairman KEVIN BRODY : 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION , Washington, DC, November 14 2017. Hon. KEVIN BRADY , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN BRADY : You asked me to comment on the changes made by H.R. 1 as ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means in the context of Clause 5(b) of Rule XXI of the House of Representatives. Clause 5(b) of Rule XXI sets special passage requirements for measures that amend subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of section 1 or section 11(b) or 55(b) of the Internal Revenue Code in a manner that imposes a new percentage rate of tax and thereby increases the amount of tax imposed by such section. H.R. 1 amends the relevant sections by eliminating the 10percent bracket, which is obviated as a marginal rate as a result of the increase in the standard deduction provided in section 63(c) and makes general changes to the income thresholds at which the varying tax rate brackets apply and eliminating several other tax rates of present law. These changes combined with the increased value of the child tax credit (in section 24) result in virtually every taxpayer who formerly would have been in the 10percent tax bracket having a lower tax liability under the changes that would be effectuated by H.R. 1 than they would under present law. Similarly, H.R. 1 eliminates the present law 33percent marginal tax bracket. As a result there are some taxpayers who would claim the standard deduction and had his or her last dollar of income taxed in the 33percent tax bracket under present law but under H.R. 1 after claiming the increased the standard deduction would have their last dollar of income taxed in the 35percent tax bracket. However, in each such case the taxpayer’s total income tax liability is lower under H.R. 1 than under present law. For taxpayers who eschew the standard deduction under present law there is substantially greater variability in resulting tax liabilities. With the elimination of some deductions that taxpayers may elect to itemize under present law, it is not possible to say in all cases that these taxpayers have lower total income tax liability under H.R. 1 than under present law. However, by comparison to the case of a taxpayer claiming the standard deduction, the variability of these results is clearly a consequence of the changes to the tax base effectuated by H.R. 1 rather than a consequence solely of the elimination of the presentlaw 33percent bracket. Because the House rule does not contemplate changes to the Internal Revenue Code as a whole and the interactions such changes have on tax liability, H.R. 1 requires a waiver of the rule’s provisions. In its totality, the combined effect of the tax rate and income threshold amendments made by the bill, along with the increase in the standard deduction, would not, in and of themselves, result in an increase in the amount of tax imposed on virtually any filer as a result of these changes. I hope this discussion is helpful. Please contact me with any questions. Sincerely, THOMAS A. B ARTHOLD . 
The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 619 O FFERED BY  MR. HASTINGS  At the end of the resolution, add the following new section: 
‘‘SEC. 5. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT RAISES TAXES ON MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES BY ELIMINATING OR LIMITING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION. 
(a) P OINT OF ORDER .—It shall not be in order in the House of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or conference report that repeals or limits the State and Local Tax Deduction (26 U.S.C. §164). (b) WAIVER IN THE HOUSE .—It shall not be in order in the House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that waives the application of subsection (a). As disposition of a point of order under this subsection, the Chair shall put the question of consideration with respect to the rule or order, as applicable. The question of consideration shall be debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one that the House adjourn.’’ THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools 
for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

Confidential information protection ‘‘(a) PURPOSES .—The purposes of this section are the following: ‘‘(1) To ensure that information supplied by individuals or organizations to an agency for statistical purposes under a pledge of confidentiality is used exclusively for statistical purposes. ‘‘(2) To ensure that individuals or organizations who supply information under a pledge of confidentiality to agencies for statistical purposes will neither have that information disclosed in identifiable form to anyone not authorized by this subchapter nor have that information used for any purpose other than a statistical purpose. ‘‘(3) To safeguard the confidentiality of individually identifiable information acquired under a pledge of confidentiality for statistical purposes by controlling access to, and uses made of, such information. ‘‘(b) USE OF STATISTICAL DATA OR INFORMA TION.—Data or information acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality and for exclusively statistical purposes shall be used by officers, employees, or agents of the agency exclusively for statistical purposes and protected in accordance with such pledge. ‘‘(c) DISCLOSURE OF STATISTICAL DATA OR  INFORMATION .— ‘‘(1) Data or information acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes shall not be disclosed by an agency in identifiable form, for any use other than an exclusively statistical purpose, except with the informed consent of the respondent. ‘‘(2) A disclosure pursuant to paragraph (1) is authorized only when the head of the agency approves such disclosure and the disclosure is not prohibited by any other law. ‘‘(3) This section does not restrict or diminish any confidentiality protections in law that otherwise apply to data or information acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes. ‘‘(d) RULE FOR USE OF DATA OR INFORMA TION FOR NONSTATISTICAL PURPOSES .—A sta tistical agency or unit shall clearly distinguish any data or information it collects for nonstatistical purposes (as authorized by law) and provide notice to the public, before the data or information is collected, that the data or information could be used for nonstatistical purposes. ‘‘(e) DESIGNATION OF AGENTS .—A statistical agency or unit may designate agents, by contract or by entering into a special agreement containing the provisions required under section 3561(2) for treatment as an agent under that section, who may perform exclusively statistical activities, subject to the limitations and penalties described in this subchapter. ‘‘(f) FINES AND PENALTIES .—Whoever, being an officer, employee, or agent of an agency acquiring information for exclusively statistical purposes, having taken and subscribed the oath of office, or having sworn to observe the limitations imposed by this section, comes into possession of such information by reason of his or her being an officer, employee, or agent and, knowing that the disclosure of the specific information is prohibited under the provisions of this subchapter, willfully discloses the information in any manner to a person or agency not entitled to receive it, shall be guilty of a class E felony and imprisoned for not more than five years, or fined not more than $250,000, or both. ‘‘PART C—STATISTICAL EFFICIENCY ‘‘§ 3575. Findings ‘‘The Congress finds the following: ‘‘(1) Federal statistics are an important source of information for public and private decisionmakers such as policymakers, consumers, businesses, investors, and workers. ‘‘(2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek to improve their efficiency. Statutory constraints limit the ability of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve higher efficiency for Federal statistical programs. ‘‘(3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the willingness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys. Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the economy. ‘‘(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will improve their ability to track more accurately the large and rapidly changing nature of United States business. In particular, the statistical agencies will be able to better ensure that businesses are consistently classified in appropriate industries, resolve data anomalies, produce statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and correct faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently. ‘‘(5) Congress enacted the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (Public Law 94–472), which allowed the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to share data on foreignowned companies. The Act not only expanded detailed industry coverage from 135 industries to over 800 industries with no increase in the data collected from respondents but also demonstrated how data sharing can result in the creation of valuable data products. ‘‘(6) With part B of this subchapter, the sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to ensure the highest level of confidentiality for respondents to statistical surveys. 
‘‘§ 3576. Designated Statistical Agencies ‘‘(a) PURPOSES .—The purposes of this section are the following: ‘‘(1) To authorize the sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes. ‘‘(2) To reduce the paperwork burdens imposed on businesses that provide requested information to the Federal Government. ‘‘(3) To improve the comparability and accuracy of Federal economic statistics by allowing the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to update sample frames, develop consistent classifications of establishments and companies into industries, improve coverage, and reconcile significant differences in data produced by the three agencies. ‘‘(4) To increase understanding of the United States economy, especially for key industry and regional statistics, to develop more accurate measures of the impact of technology on productivity growth, and to enhance the reliability of the Nation’s most important economic indicators, such as the National Income and Product Accounts. ‘‘(b) RESPONSIBILITIES OF DESIGNATED STATISTICAL AGENCIES .—The head of each of the Designated Statistical Agencies shall— ‘‘(1) identify opportunities to eliminate duplication and otherwise reduce reporting burden and cost imposed on the public in providing information for statistical purposes; ‘‘(2) enter into joint statistical projects to improve the quality and reduce the cost of statistical programs; and ‘‘(3) protect the confidentiality of individually identifiable information acquired for statistical purposes by adhering to safeguard principles, including— ‘‘(A) emphasizing to their officers, employees, and agents the importance of protecting the confidentiality of information in cases where the identity of individual respondents can reasonably be inferred by either direct or indirect means; ‘‘(B) training their officers, employees, and agents in their legal obligations to protect the confidentiality of individually identifiable information and in the procedures that must be followed to provide access to such information; ‘‘(C) implementing appropriate measures to assure the physical and electronic security of confidential data; ‘‘(D) establishing a system of records that identifies individuals accessing confidential data and the project for which the data were required; and ‘‘(E) being prepared to document their compliance with safeguard principles to other agencies authorized by law to monitor such compliance. ‘‘(c) SHARING OF BUSINESS DATA AMONG  DESIGNATED STATISTICAL AGENCIES .— ‘‘(1) IN GENERAL .—A Designated Statistical Agency may provide business data in an identifiable form to another Designated Statistical Agency under the terms of a written agreement among the agencies sharing the business data that specifies— ‘‘(A) the business data to be shared; ‘‘(B) the statistical purposes for which the business data are to be used; ‘‘(C) the officers, employees, and agents authorized to examine the business data to be shared; and ‘‘(D) appropriate security procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of the business data. ‘‘(2) RESPONSIBILITIES OF AGENCIES UNDER

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include in the RECORD extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. RYAN), the sponsor of the bill and my friend, the Speaker of the House. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act. First, I want to thank the sponsors of the bill. I want to thank Mr. FARENTHOLD . I want to thank Mr. K ILMER. I want to thank Chairman G OWDY . BLAKE FARENTHOLD and D EREK KILMER were the key drivers of this measure, and they made it stronger by incorporating their OPEN Government Data Act. TREY GOWDY and his staff—I don’t know where he is. He is probably working on his hair. TREY GOWDY and his staff—especially Katy Rother—spent countless hours working with our team—especially Ted McCann—and others to turn the Commission on EvidenceBased Policymaking’s vision into legislation. All the members of this Commission did incredible work. I want to especially thank Senator PATTY MURRAY for her willingness to 
work together on this issue. We may be on different sides of the aisle, but there is one thing that we passionately agree on, and that is what the government does, it should do it well. The taxpayer’s money should always be protected, and that is exactly why we came together to write this bipartisan legislation. So what does this bill actually do? It protects privacy. It improves transparency. It ensures that Federal agencies are protecting the data collected by the government. The American people deserve to know and they deserve to understand exactly what data the government is actually collecting. They deserve to know that the strictest safeguards are placed on that data. The driving purpose of this legislation is very simple: we are requiring Federal agencies to prioritize evidence when they are measuring a program’s success. Go figure. Here is what we are talking about. Let’s just take poverty, for example. Instead of measuring success based on inputs, instead of measuring success based on how many programs we have created, how much money we are spending, how many people are on those programs, let’s measure success based on results: Is it working? Are people getting out of poverty? Are the goals and objectives of these bills and these laws actually being achieved or not? By directing agencies to do this, no longer will ‘‘we don’t know’’ be an acceptable answer when asked if a program is actually working. It is really just kind of crazy, but so much of what government does, government doesn’t actually see whether or not it is actually succeeding at doing it. So we have got to get off of this input effortbased system, this 20th century relic, and on to clearly identifiable, evidencebased terms, conditions, data, results, outcomes. With this bill, we are asking the Federal bureaucracy to step up its game. We are asking ourselves: How can we improve the lives of our fellow citizens by better understanding the programs that we put in place? How can we make sure that the money that is being spent on behalf of the hardworking taxpayers, who send the money here in the first place, is being spent wisely, efficiently, effectively? We need results, not just effort. This is just good, commonsense policy, and it is going to mean a real sea change in how we solve problems and how government actually works. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I thank the sponsors for all of their hard work. b1445 Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act, as amended, would establish a framework to support greater access and use of government data. I want to thank Representatives DEREK KILMER and B LAKE FARENTHOLD  for their work on the OPEN Government Data Act, which is the basis for title II of this bill. I also want to thank Speaker RYAN, Senator M URRAY , and Chairman GOWDY for their bipartisan work on this issue. This bill would require that agencies make data ‘‘open by default’’ and develop a plan for building evidence in their agencies. The bill would require that the Office of Management and Budget develop a Federal catalog and inventory of agency data assets and that each agency designate chief evaluation officers and chief data officers who would work to ensure that agencies utilize data effectively. The goal of this bill is to ensure that Congress and the executive branch are able to make important policy decisions based on evidence. This is not always the case. For example, take the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program. Funding for that program was recently cut even though there is significant evidence that it works well. If we are going to demand more and higher quality evidence from these Federal agencies, it is imperative that Congress and the executive branch advance policies supported by that evidence. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to support H.R. 4174, introduced by Speaker RYANand of which I am an original cosponsor. The American people deserve an efficient and effective Federal Government. I think we can all agree on that. Taxpayers have the right to know their money is being spent wisely. All too often, decisionmakers throughout the Federal Government make choices without sufficient evidence and data to inform them and guide them in making those decisions. In the previous Congress, Speaker RYAN and Senator P ATTY MURRAY introduced the bicameral and bipartisan EvidenceBased Policymaking Commission Act of 2016. The Commission was charged with studying and making recommendations related to access and use of evidence to support effective policymaking. Believe it or not, they finished in about a year. The Commission on EvidenceBased Policymaking released their report September 7 of this year. The Commission made 22 recommendations on how to improve how evidence is accessed, produced, secured, and maintained by the Federal Government. On September 26, 2017, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing entitled ‘‘Recommendations of the Commission on EvidenceBased Policymaking.’’ At that hearing, four members of the Commission explained the intent of the recommendations and the need for more evidence to improve policymaking. According to Dr. Ron Haskins, the cochair of the Commission, evidence showed that many of the Nation’s social programs produced modest to no impacts. H.R. 4174, the Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act of 2017, addresses several recommendations from the final report issued by the Commission. The bill lays the groundwork for critical examination of what is working and what is not working in the Federal Government. Policy decisions should be based on facts. Those folks of my generation will remember Sergeant Joe Friday in ‘‘Dragnet:’’ ‘‘Just the facts, ma’am.’’ That is what we are trying to get ahold of here. According to the Commission on EvidenceBased Policymaking, too little evidence is produced in the Federal Government to meet this need. The Commission also found cumbersome and idiosyncratic data access procedures create confusion, impose unnecessary costs, and are a barrier to evidence building. Additionally, according to the Government Accountability Office, agencies’ continued lack of evaluations may be the greatest barrier to their informing managers and policymakers and constitutes a lost opportunity to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of limited government resources. These barriers are standing between the taxpayers and the effective government that they had paid for and that they deserve. H.R. 4174 removes some of the barriers the Commission identified and encourages agencies to expand the use of evidence in decisionmaking. First, each agency will need to designate a chief evaluation officer and submit annual evidencebuilding plans to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget. This bill also establishes an advisory committee to review, analyze, and make recommendations on how to expand access to and use of data for evidence building. It also includes the OPEN Government Data Act that Representative KILMER and I introduced. The OPEN Government Data Act addresses the Commission’s recommendation to expand access to information about data. The OPEN Government Data Act requires Federal agencies to develop a comprehensive inventory of Federal data and increases access to specific data assets that are appropriate for public release. This isn’t personally identifiable, confidential, private, or classified information. It also establishes an openbydefault standard for Federal data, meaning data will be available under an open format and open license, and it will be 
in a machinereadable format. We are going to crowdsource some of this evidence building. We are going to let the private sector or nonprofits or whomever access this data, find ways to use it, build data, and, again, get more bang for the taxpayer’s dollar. The bill further improves data management and collection by codifying the position of chief data officer and clarifying the CDO roles and responsibilities. Finally, H.R. 4174 establishes a process by which statistical agencies can access data, ensure effective and consistent privacy protections, and develop methods to reduce the sensitivity of data. This will expand opportunities for use of the data by the evidence building community. The Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act of 2017 was reported favorably out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I come back to the bottom line on this: Americans expect policymakers to make decisions based on facts. And decisions based on facts are better decisions that will save taxpayer money and be good for America. H.R. 4174 will help make these expectations a reality. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER ). Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Imagine you are a coder and you have a great idea for an app that predicts the weather or identifies traffic flows or helps people navigate the social service system. You know how to code the app, but you can’t afford to set up your own system to collect the data—the weather data or the traffic data or what have you. Now, imagine you build the app and you can pull data that the government is already collecting so you can build the app and use the data. It turns out that you have got something that is either good at predicting the weather or helping commuters or helping folks navigate the social services system or whatever and it grows into a business. You can actually employ people. You can put people to work. A project that may have started as a hobby could become your life’s work. The Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act, and specifically title II of this bill called the OPEN Government Data Act, will actually help make stories like that become a common thing. This bill gives entrepreneurs and innovators huge amounts of publicly funded data so that they can innovate and come up with applications that we haven’t even thought of yet. It also means that government agencies can share data more easily and ultimately provide services more effectively. Most importantly, it allows citizens to participate in their government by making government more transparent and accountable. Mr. Speaker, data is the spark that drives innovative ideas, and I drafted the OPEN Government Data Act with Representatives FARENTHOLD and Senators SCHATZ and S ASSE to support new startups by providing innovators with the legal elbow room to use public information and public data and to create jobs. It reduces the burden to entry by lowering the cost to access and format data. It will open new business opportunities. Making more government data public will pump up the data analytics boom currently driving new innovation, and I expect that access to this data will lead to things that we haven’t even thought up yet. I am proud to work with Speaker RYAN, Chairman G OWDY , and Senator MURRAY to incorporate that bill into this broader legislation. It will help us measure how government programs are actually working or not. Establishing a data inventory will help government officials understand what data they have so that they can use it, and they don’t duplicate work that is already getting done. Making the government’s data searchable and accessible will help public servants make better decisions, and it will help the public and the press hold government more accountable. Let me give you an example. Mr. Speaker, I represent more military veterans than just about any Member of this body. Like many of us, I was horrified to learn several years ago that the Department of Veterans Affairs was struggling to provide the services and treatments that were earned by military veterans. Now imagine if the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee or the Government Accountability Office or even the VA had access to some of the data around wait times earlier. The pain caused to veterans and their families could have been avoided. Imagine if the leaders of the Veterans Administration knew that newspapers were going to have access to that data, whether it be the Kitsap Sun in my district or The New York Times or whoever. Imagine that they were looking at that data, too. It is time for government to move into the 21st century and start using the data it is collecting to improve the services it is providing. Let me just speak briefly about what this bill does. This gets a little wonky, but I actually think it is pretty important. This legislation sets up a way for everyone to use the government’s data. We spent a long time working to make sure that the terms used in the bill didn’t trap government policy in this year or this decade. We hope that this legislation will act as a building block for future technologies and applications of Federal data. We included some important pieces to ensure that data is not only available, but that it is easily used. Data has to be machinereadable. Many of us, I think, have gone on the internet and gotten a data set in PDF form that you can’t really do anything with. It is so annoying. It is pretty obvious that in 2017 you should be able to use your computer to find what you are looking for. Data has to be open format, and data should be malleable. Professionals inside and outside of government should be able to use that data in various ways. Government data should be provided under an open license. If the government owns the data, that means the people paid for it, and they should be able to use it for free. Let me quickly talk about what this bill doesn’t do. The bill does not take away safeguards that protect personal privacy, national security, and intellectual property. The legislation would not affect existing contracts, so the government is not going to go to a contractor and say: Oh, by the way, your data is now free and available to the public. Importantly, the bill does not alter the government’s need to pay for private data rights in the future when it identifies private data that it may want to access and have ownership of. This bill only applies to data that is owned and controlled by the Federal Government. It does not provide an advantage to one sector or technology over another. Mr. Speaker, let me just say in closing, for the past 2 years, several of us have worked on this issue and with experts throughout the private and public sector to get this bill past the finish line. I am proud to stand here today in support of a bipartisan bill that can move our economy forward, that can improve efficiency in our government, and can help citizens get more involved in our democratic republic. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues’ support of this bill. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ), who is on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4174, the Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act of 2017. I am pleased to see the bill’s sponsors and the Speaker move forward with the reforms proposed by the Commission on EvidenceBased Policymaking. H.R. 4174 aims to create and use technology to assess and solve problems; in other words, to make sure tools exist to gauge whether programs work to best serve the American people. It is about utilizing the data we already have to find out what works, what doesn’t work, and what could work for some changes. The bill requires agencies to develop evidencebuilding plans, key outcomes and return investment for the money the taxpayers pay, and creates the position of a chief evaluation officer. Imagine that, we have to actually create a position to evaluate because we 
aren’t doing it effectively now. It establishes an advisory committee to study the Commission’s recommendation that Congress create a National Secure Data Service. It includes the OPEN Government Data Act, which ensures that government aggregate data is available to consumers in a usable format. As my colleague said on the other side of the aisle, to make the data malleable, to make the data open format so that, in fact, people can assess not just in government agencies, but out in the public what the data is saying about the programs that they pay for that we fund. Finally, the bill also creates procedures to share that data across Federal agencies and to require protection of individual data that makes up all that aggregate data. All of these provisions are critical to setting our government on a path toward better serving the people in this country. Washington can no longer assess quality based on how much money we dump into programs, how many people we enroll—outcomes that don’t tell us whether or not they are succeeding. This can only be done with quality, accessible data. By allowing key data to be connected and reported, we can build evidence to determine what does and doesn’t work. More importantly, the American people can see the evidence of what does and doesn’t work rather than just bureaucrats in Washington. I would also like to point out how the reforms are working here to lay the foundation for government and Congress to create new policies that apply this information in novel ways. This act, in its call for transparent, efficient, and welldesigned data systems, dovetails with other efforts in Congress for transparency and sharing data. A bill I am working on, the College Transparency Act, would do just that for student data and outcomes data from colleges and universities to better enable students and families to make more informed decisions on one of the most important part of their lives: what postsecondary education they pursue and what the outcome will be. b1500 This bill, and my bill, streamlines and updates higher education information. It is time to utilize and make meaning out of all the data we currently have and provide that to the taxpayers. The Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act and the College Transparency Act both share a few critical goals of the Commission on EvidenceBased Policymaking: First is the protection of the privacy of individuals that may be reflected in the data. That is the first priority. Second is the recommendation that information be more readily shared across agencies. Agencies actually will share what they already know about programs. Third is that agencies develop a strategy to share this data with the public who pays for those programs. These provisions are fundamental to responsibly and effectively utilizing the data that the taxpayers pay for. The Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act sets in motion these commonsense policies that will increase the return on investment for the taxpayers and the outcomes of our programs. The compartmentalization of data the government already collects and barriers that prevent the reasonable sharing of it represent a significant missed opportunity for the government to provide value to taxpayers. It amazes me that we had to create a commission to tell us to share this data. Taxpayers have already paid for it. Why aren’t we already using it? Long term, these plans are essential. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. This is a good government bill with bipartisan, bicameral support that will give Americans access to the data that they have paid for, will give lawmakers access to the data they need to make decisions, and will give policymakers and leadership in the executive branch the data they need to make better decisions to save taxpayers money and to do a better job at the things that we are trying to do in government. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4174, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
HOWARD B. PATE, JR. POST OFFICE Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3369) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 225 North Main Street in Spring Lake, North Carolina, as the ‘‘Howard B. Pate, Jr. Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3369 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 225 North Main Street in Spring Lake, North Carolina, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Howard B. Pate, Jr. Post Office’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Howard B. Pate, Jr. Post Office’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3369, introduced by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON). The bill names the United States Post Office at 225 North Main Street in Spring Lake, North Carolina, after Howard B. Pate, Jr., a World War II veteran and former postmaster of Spring Lake. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON ) to discuss the bill. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3369, a bill recognizing the life and legacy of Howard B. Pate, Jr., by naming the Spring Lake, North Carolina, Post Office in his honor. Born in Bladen County, North Carolina, in 1925, Mr. Pate first moved to Spring Lake, a town in the Eighth Congressional District I am proud to represent, where his father was stationed at Fort Bragg. Being from a military family, when the United States entered World War II, Mr. Pate answered the call to serve his country and continued his service as a member of the North Carolina National Guard until 1952. After finishing his military service, Mr. Pate assumed the position of Spring Lake’s postmaster. He served in this position for 30 years, until his retirement in 1982. After retiring, Mr. Pate remained active in the community as a member of many civic organizations, including being named town historian in 1994, a post he held for more than two decades. For all his efforts, the local Chamber of Commerce named their Volunteer of the Year award after Mr. Pate. The town of Spring Lake unanimously adopted a resolution to dedicate their post office in honor of Mr. 
Howard Pate, Jr., because there was never a person who embodied the spirit of the community more than he. Sadly, Mr. Pate passed away 1 year ago yesterday, on November 14, 2016. On the first anniversary of his passing, I can think of no better way to honor his respected life than to name the post office after him in a town he loved and where he lived and served most of his life. As any Spring Lake resident will tell you, Mr. Pate was not only a pillar of our community, but also a cherished friend. He worked tirelessly to ensure we kept a strong grip on our past while making Spring Lake a better place for future generations. It is my honor to make sure he will always be a part of our legacy in the future by naming the Spring Lake Post Office in his honor. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 3369, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located at 225 North Main Street in Spring Lake, North Carolina, as the Howard B. Pate, Jr. Post Office. Born in 1925, Howard Pate joined the Army in 1944, 2 years after his high school graduation. In early 1945, Howard deployed to Europe as part of the famed 101st Airborne Division. Later serving in the 82nd Airborne Division, Howard was discharged from Active Duty in 1946, but he continued his service as a member of the North Carolina Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve. He retired in 1965, as a sergeant major in the 13th Special Forces Group. Following his military service, Howard was appointed postmaster of Spring Lake, North Carolina, and served as both a State vice president and president of the National Association of Postmasters. He was also an active member of his community, serving as a deacon at the First Presbyterian Church of Spring Lake, charter president of the Spring Lake Jaycees, and a member of the Greater Spring Lake Chamber of Commerce for over 50 years, where the Volunteer of the Year award is named in his honor. Howard Pate passed away a year ago this week, as we heard, on November 14, 2016. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor Howard Pate’s life of service to his community and to his country. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3369, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I join Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN and Mr. HUDSON in urging passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3369. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
TILDEN VETERANS POST OFFICE Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1207) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 306 River Street in Tilden, Texas, as the ‘‘Tilden Veterans Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to support H.R. 1207, introduced by the gentleman from south Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ). H.R. 1207 honors the veterans of Tilden, Texas, for their service to this great Nation by naming the United States Post Office at 306 River Street in Tilden, Texas, as the Tilden Veterans Post Office. This bill is particularly timely, as we just celebrated Veterans Day this past Saturday. I look forward to hearing more about this bill from my friend and colleague from Laredo, Mr. CUELLAR . Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 1207, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located at 306 River Street in Tilden, Texas, as the Tilden Veterans Post Office. Military men and women sacrifice their time, energy, and lives for our country every day. Whether serving in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard, these brave individuals risk their lives to protect others and demonstrate an unmatched level of selflessness, courage, and dedication. While this bill will name the post office in Tilden, Texas, in honor of all veterans who have served, I would like to specifically recognize the service of Mr. Anselmo Villarreal. Drafted into the Army in March of 1968, he served in Vietnam until 1970, and he continues to serve his fellow veterans through volunteer work at his local veterans service organization. His story is not unlike other servicemembers who give their time at home and abroad to protect and improve their communities in so many ways. In recognizing his contributions, we recognize the contributions of veterans throughout Texas and the United States, and we thank them for their work. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to celebrate the lives of American veterans and commemorate the sacrifices that each have made for the good of our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1207, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ). Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for yielding and for her kind words about the Tilden Veterans Post Office. I also want to thank my friend from Corpus Christi, Texas, for his kind words on the naming of this post office. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to support and present H.R. 1207, which will name the post office facility in my district as the Tilden Veterans Post Office. Across my district, there are many examples of fine men and women who have honorably served our country. It is imperative that we honor their service and dedication to our Nation. Dedicating this post office to our veterans will serve as a constant reminder of the sacrifices that our friends, neighbors, and families made while serving their country. These are individuals who put country ahead of self and for whom I am proud to recognize with the dedicating of the post office facility. For example, as the gentlewoman from New Jersey said, Anselmo Villarreal of Tilden, Texas, was drafted in the Army in 1968. He served in Vietnam. After his service, Mr. Villarreal 
returned to Tilden and worked in a local plant for 28 years before retiring. This veteran also continues to serve his community by volunteering for local veterans service organizations. We owe our freedom to veterans like Mr. Villarreal and others, which is why I am recognizing him and the other veterans with the dedication of this post office. He is one example of many veterans who have made countless sacrifices for our country in the face of danger. The courage and dedication of our veterans toward our Nation demonstrates what it really means to be an American—the essence of being an American. I also thank the veterans from Tilden and McMullen County for their service and sacrifice for our country. I also thank the veterans organizations throughout my district for their tireless work in providing the care our veterans need. There are many local organizations like the veterans service offices in McMullen County that provide essential care to those who have returned home from service. Let us remember and express gratitude to these brave people: the veterans, their families, as well as the care providers. In the words of President John F. Kennedy: ‘‘As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.’’ b1515 Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. CUELLAR  for introducing this bill. For those of you not from Texas who don’t know where Tilden, Texas, is, if you know about where San Antonio is, you go down south about a quarter of the way to the Rio Grande Valley and you are going to pass through Tilden. It is kind of northwest of my hometown of Corpus Christi. I can tell you, having represented a lot of the area in south Texas, as does Mr. CUELLAR , that this region is a region of the State that really does thank and appreciate the veterans who have sacrificed so much to serve for this country and for their families. I think it is entirely proper and absolutely a great idea to be naming this post office after our veterans, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1207. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
STAFF SERGEANT PETER TAUB POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2873) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 207 Glenside Avenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, as the ‘‘Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2873 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. STAFF SERGEANT PETER TAUB POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 207 Glenside Avenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2873, introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ). The bill names the United States Post Office at 207 Glenside Avenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, after U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Peter Taub. During his service, Staff Sergeant Taub participated in more than 12 combat missions in hostile areas. Staff Sergeant Taub was killed in action on December 21, 2015, in an ambush suicide attack in Afghanistan. He gave his life in service to this Nation. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ) for introducing this bill to honor the bravery and sacrifice of Staff Sergeant Taub. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 2873, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located at 207 Glenside Avenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, as the Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post Office Building. A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mr. Taub was inspired by his grandfather’s World War II military service to join the Air Force in 2007. He loaded missiles for F–15 fighter jets in Japan before transferring to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, where he specialized in arming B–1 bombers. In 2013, after earning his bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity, Peter became a special agent in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and participated in over a dozen combat missions through hostile areas. On December 21, 2015, while in Afghanistan, Staff Sergeant Taub gave his life, along with four of his fellow airmen, when his unit was ambushed in a suicide attack. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Air Force Commendation Medal, and Air Force Combat Action Medal, and he leaves behind a beloved wife and two children. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor Staff Sergeant Peter Taub’s bravery and remember the ultimate sacrifice he made to protect our Nation. I urge the passage of H.R. 2873. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ). Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from not too far away in Trenton, New Jersey, as well as my colleague from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Today, I rise in support of H.R. 2873, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 207 Glenside Avenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, as the Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post Office Building. Staff Sergeant Taub, a constituent of my 13th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, was a shining example of the best our country has to offer. He exemplified unwavering patriotism and heroic bravery. Peter made the ultimate sacrifice for his country when a suicide bomber took his life in Afghanistan in December 2015. Renaming the Wyncote Post Office in his hometown is really the least we can do to honor him. It is a small but important symbol of our eternal thanks. I am here today urging the House to pass my legislation to do just that. Peter was born on November 2, 1985, in my hometown of Philadelphia, to his parents, Joel Taub and Arlene Wagner. Peter was then raised in Wyncote, 
Pennsylvania, and graduated from Cheltenham High School in 2004. His mother, Arlene, and brother, Jonathan, run the very popular Washington, D.C., sandwich shop called Bub and Pop’s. Peter was inspired by his grandfather’s service in World War II, so he enlisted in the Air Force in December of 2007 after attending community college for some time. During his career in the military, Peter was assigned to a base in Japan, where he loaded missiles onto F–15 fighter jets. Three years later, he was transferred to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, where he specialized in arming B–1 bombers. Peter went on to obtain a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity and was hired as a special agent in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations in December 2013. During his service, Peter participated in more than 12 combat missions in hostile areas. Peter was killed, along with four other airmen, in a suicide ambush attack in Afghanistan on December 21, 2015. Peter is survived by his wife, Christina; their 3yearold daughter, Penelope; and another daughter, Petra, who was born after Peter’s death in the summer of 2016. President Obama paid tribute to Peter, as well as the other troops who were killed in the attack, calling their service ‘‘outstanding’’ and ‘‘brave.’’ I second those descriptions. Posthumously, Peter was awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Air Force Commendation Medal, and the Air Force Combat Action Medal. It is my hope that, with this legislation, the 13th District of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will pay daily tribute to the memory of one of our heroes, Staff Sergeant Peter Taub. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2873. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SR. CHIEF RYAN OWENS POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3109) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1114 North 2nd Street in Chillicothe, Illinois, as the ‘‘Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3109 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SR. CHIEF RYAN OWENS POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1114 North 2nd Street in Chillicothe, Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3109, introduced by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD). The bill names the United States Post Office at 1114 North 2nd Street in Chillicothe, Illinois, after U.S. Navy SEAL Senior Chief Ryan Owens, who was killed in action in Yemen earlier this year. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD) to further describe the bill and Senior Chief Owens’ service to his country. Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding the time for this important legislation. On January 29, 2017, U.S. Navy Chief Special Warfare Operator William ‘‘Ryan’’ Owens was killed during a raid in Yemen. At the age of 36, he gave the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect our great Nation. Today, he is survived by his wife, Carryn, and their three young children. Ryan Owens grew up in Edelstein, Illinois, in my congressional district, a town that is in a very rural area with barely one stop sign. Friends and family say that, even at a very early age, Ryan knew he wanted to serve his country as a Navy SEAL. After graduating from Illinois Valley Central High School in Chillicothe, Illinois, in 1998, he took the first steps towards his goal by enlisting in the Navy. Ryan served his first tour of duty at the Office of Naval Intelligence in Suitland, Maryland, eventually completing his SEAL training in California in 2002. Over the next 15 years, he completed four tours as a U.S. Navy SEAL, working all over the globe to fight against terrorism and protect the interests of the United States. Ryan was 2 years into his fifth tour as a Navy SEAL when he was tragically killed during an intelligence gathering operation against an al Qaida cell in Yemen. Throughout his 15 years as a Navy SEAL, Ryan Owens gave much to our country, protecting our freedoms, and helping rid the world of evil. It is for these reasons that I introduced H.R. 3109, which will rename the post office in Chillicothe, Illinois, as the Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post Office Building. My office and I worked closely with the U.S. Postal Service, the U.S. Navy Congressional Liaison’s Office, the Central Illinois Gold Star Families, and, most importantly, Ryan’s family. All of us were determined to make sure we got this right, choosing a location with strong ties to the community in which Ryan grew up. In the end, it was his wife, Carryn, who decided on Chillicothe, the town where Ryan attended and graduated high school, as the best place for this building to be renamed in his honor. b1530 I was proud to introduce our bill with overwhelming bipartisan support here in the House with every member of the Illinois delegation signing on as a cosponsor in support. It is my hope that the House acts to pass this bill today and that the Senate will quickly follow suit. While we can never repay Chief Owens or his family for the sacrifices he made, renaming the post office in his honor is a small way to thank him for his service and dedication to protecting our great Nation and the values that we hold so dear. We continue, today, to pray for Carryn and his children. We are indebted to his service and his sacrifice to our great country. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 3109, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located at 1114 North 2nd Street in Chillicothe, Illinois, as the Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post Office Building. A native of Edelstein, Illinois, Ryan Owens graduated from Illinois Valley Central High School and joined the Navy in 1998. Ryan served at the Office of Naval Intelligence before completing SEAL training and was selected as a chief petty officer in 2009. While on his fifth tour of duty with the elite SEAL Team Six, Ryan sustained wounds in a firefight and succumbed to his injuries on January 29, 2017. Ryan’s dedicated service has been recognized through a number of awards 
and medals, including the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, a Bronze Star and Bronze Stars with Combat V, a Joint Service Achievement Medal, and three Presidential Unit Citations. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the heroism of Sr. Chief Ryan Owens and recognize the ultimate sacrifice he made for our country. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 3109, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. TAYLOR ). Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3109. Mr. Speaker, one of society’s greatest challenges is honoring and recording with immortal honor the names, the deeds, and the history of our heroes. But I believe it is an easy choice to honor Sr. Chief SEAL Ryan Owens, who was deployed to a country most Americans would struggle to find on a map. He spent countless times away from his family, protecting our Nation so that we didn’t have to. Most people will never understand the sacrifice required to keep evil outside of our gates. Ryan did it for our country, for his family, and for the soldier on his left or his right. He traded comfort for hardship time and time again, and ultimately his life. This to preserve our right to think, our right to believe, and our right to become whatever we want in this life. His shining example and sacrifice will be a beacon for generations to come who will step up to fight, if needed, for a Godgiven inheritance of freedom, no matter the cost. I urge my colleagues to support this United States Post Office designation to a great American man and warrior, Sr. Chief SEAL Ryan Owens. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3109. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
ROBERT H. JENKINS POST OFFICE Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3893) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 100 Mathe Avenue in Interlachen, Florida, as the ‘‘Robert H. Jenkins Post Office’’, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3893 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 100 Mathe Avenue in Interlachen, Florida, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Robert H. Jenkins, Jr. Post Office’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Robert H. Jenkins, Jr. Post Office’’.

Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3893, introduced by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). The bill names the United States Post Office located at 100 Mathe Avenue in Interlachen, Florida, after U.S. Marine Private First Class Robert H. Jenkins, Jr., who was killed in action during the Vietnam war. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) to further describe the bill and Private First Class Jenkins’ service to our country. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of my bill, H.R. 3893, which renames the post office in Interlachen, Florida, to honor a great American hero, Robert H. Jenkins, Jr. Robert H. Jenkins, Jr., enlisted in the Marines in February of 1968. In July of that year, as a Private First Class, he was transferred to the Republic of Vietnam. Serving as a machine gunner with Company C, south of the demilitarized zone, he was killed in action. On March 5, 1969, his reconnaissance team was assaulted by a North Vietnamese Army platoon. During the firefight, a hand grenade was thrown at him and a comrade. Realizing the consequences of his actions, Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., pushed his comrade to the ground and leapt on the hand grenade to shield him from the explosion. Absorbing the full impact of the blast, he was seriously injured and succumbed to his wounds. John 15:13 states: Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friend. 
On April 20, 1970, the Medal of Honor was presented to his family at the White House by Vice President Agnew. Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., is buried at Sister Spring Baptist Cemetery in Interlachen, Florida. The sacrifice Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., made cannot be understated. Naming his hometown post office after him is just one small way we as a nation can continue to honor this American hero. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 3893, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located at 100 Mathe Avenue in Interlachen, Florida, as the Robert H. Jenkins Post Office. Robert Jenkins joined the United States Marine Corps in Jacksonville, Florida, in February of 1968. After completing training at Camp Lejeune, Robert was assigned to the 3rd Marine Division in Vietnam. There he served as a scout, driver, machine gunner for Company C in an area south of the demilitarized zone. In the early morning of March 5, 1969, Private First Class Jenkins’ team was suddenly attacked by the North Vietnamese Army. While Private First Class Jenkins and a fellow marine returned machine gun fire, a hand grenade was thrown at their location. In an act of pure selflessness, Private First Class Jenkins threw himself on top of his fellow marine, shielding him from the explosion, while absorbing the full force himself. Tragically, Private First Class was gravely wounded and died soon after. Private First Class Jenkins was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his valiant actions in April 1970. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the valiant actions of Private First Class Jenkins and to remember his courage and selflessness devotion to his fellow marines. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3893. I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 3893, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 100 Mathe Avenue in Interlachen, Florida, as the ‘Robert H. Jenkins, Jr. Post Office’.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2672, introduced by the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS ). The bill names the United States Post Office located at 520 Carter Street in Fairview, Illinois, after U.S. Army Sergeant Douglas J. Riney. Sergeant Riney was deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from July 2014 to February 2015 and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel beginning June 2016. In October 2016, Sergeant Riney died of wounds received after encountering hostile enemy forces in Kabul. We honor his service to our Nation. I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for introducing this bill to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Sergeant Riney. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 2672, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located at 520 Carter Street in Fairview, Illinois, as the Sgt. Douglas J. Riney Post Office. Born in Georgia in 1990, Douglas Riney graduated from Spoon River Valley High School in Illinois, and married his wife, Kylie, in 2012. The two of them lived in Fairview with children Elea and James, where Douglas proudly volunteered as a firefighter, cheered for the Green Bay Packers, and loved spending time outdoors riding his motorcycle, hunting, and fishing. Douglas served on Active Duty in the U.S. Army, deploying in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from July 2014 to February 2015, and again as a part of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel beginning in June 2016. He was assigned to the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division. Tragically, on October 19, 2016, Sergeant Douglas Riney was killed in action at the hands of hostile enemy forces in Kabul, Afghanistan. Sergeant Douglas Riney was awarded the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and Army Commendation Medal, among other honors, for his valiant service. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to remember the courage and the sacrifice of Sergeant Douglas Riney and honor his memory for years to come. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 2672, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS ), my colleague. b1545 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, which would designate the post office in Fairview, Illinois, as the Sgt. Douglas J. Riney Post Office. Sergeant Riney, who died on October 19, 2016, of wounds received from hostile enemy forces in Kabul, Afghanistan, lived a life dedicated to service. After he graduated from Spoon River Valley High School, Sergeant Riney became a volunteer firefighter with the Fairview Fire Protection District. He was known as a man who could always be counted on by his community, a man who felt a calling to public service. He joined the Army, entering Active Duty in July of 2012. Sergeant Riney was deployed as part of Operation Enduring Freedom from July 2014 to February 2015. In June of 2016, he was again deployed to Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. As part of the Support Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, Texas, Sergeant Riney excelled at his work. Throughout his time in the Army, Sergeant Riney was repeatedly recognized with commendations, including the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Army Commendation Medal. At home, Sergeant Riney lived with his wife, Kylie, and their two children, Elea and James. He is survived by his loving family: his father and his stepmother, Dave and Kristie Riney; his mother and stepfather, Pam and Don Boland; his brother, Jeff Budd; his sister, Stacey Budd; two stepbrothers, Bryce and Kole Vaughn; and one stepsister, Ashlie Herrin. On the fateful day of October 19, 2016, our Nation lost one of its finest, and the community of Fairview lost one of its best. The naming of the Fairview Post Office is just a small token of our appreciation for Sergeant Riney, who made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation. While we can never fill the hole left in the family, the Fairview community, or the Nation, I hope this post office will serve as a proud commemoration of a man who dedicated his life to serving others and as an inspiration for those who just hear his name. On behalf of the hardworking men and women of the Illinois 17th Congressional District, I will never forget the service of Sergeant Douglas Riney, and we will always honor his sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for the consideration of this bill. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COMER.

ZACHARY ADDINGTON POST OFFICE Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3821) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 430 Main Street in Clermont, Georgia, as the ‘‘Zachary Addington Post Office’’, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3821 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 430 Main Street in Clermont, Georgia, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Zack T. Addington Post Office’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Zack T. Addington Post Office’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3821, introduced by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ). The bill names the United States Post Office at 430 Main Street in Clermont, Georgia, after U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Zach T. Addington, who was killed in action in the Vietnam war. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) to further describe the bill and Lance Corporal Addington’s service to our country. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky and the gentlewoman from New Jersey for being a part of this today. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3821, legislation to name the Clermont Post Office after Lance Corporal Zach T. Addington. I introduced this legislation to honor Zach, a fellow northeast Georgian, for giving his life in service to our Nation during the Vietnam war. Zach Addington was born to Addison S. and Lillie Addington on November 1, 1948, in Gainesville, Georgia. He and his family lived in Clermont, Georgia, where he attended Clermont Elementary School and my alma mater, which we share, North Hall High School. He graduated in 1967. Zach enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as a private, in July of 1967, and became a rifleman in the 3rd Marine Division of the Fleet Marine Force. He was promoted to private first class on December 1, 1967, and he was deployed to Vietnam on December 19 of the same year. On April 1, 1968, Zach was promoted to lance corporal. His company was participating in Operation Scotland II when they engaged hostile forces in the vicinity of Hill 689, four kilometers westsouthwest of Khe Sanh Airfield. On May 16, 1968, Zach Addington was killed in action. His captain, William McArdle, stated that he was ‘‘one of the finest marines I have ever known. His exemplary conduct, leadership, and singular determination to do every job well were qualities that all of us respected.’’ On June 6, 1968, Mr. Addington was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Ribbon in recognition of his service in Vietnam. His family hopes to display these awards in the Clermont Post Office after the naming. He is survived by his brother, Addison S. Addington; and sisters, Billie Quillin and Sandra Montgomery. The memory of Zach’s courage and his service lives on in our corner of Georgia, and the naming of the Clermont Post Office in his honor will be a reminder to all of us of his sacrifice and the sacrifices of the armed services to us all. There is a time when we come to these post offices and we read accomplishments, Mr. Speaker. We read accomplishments of many folks, but each one has a story to tell. I think really, when you start to listen to the many whom we have talked about today, there is a certain theme of service that runs through each. There is a certain theme of something bigger than themselves, and especially those who gave their life. Zach Addington was one who went willingly. He knew that he may not return, in fact, even told people he may not, and he did not, but that service and that sacrifice gives us the ability to stand here today and to do what we do. By standing here today, I intend to honor him for the naming of this post office and would encourage my colleagues to vote in favor. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 3821, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located at 430 Main Street in Clermont, Georgia, as the Zachary Addington Post Office. Born in Gainesville, Georgia, in 1948, Zachary Addington graduated from North Hall High School in 1967. He chose to enlist in the Marine Corps that year, becoming a private in the 3rd Marine Division of the Fleet Marine Force. He deployed to Vietnam that December as a private first class. On May 16, 1968, thenLance Corporal Addington was participating in Operation Scotland II with his company when he was tragically killed in action. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart, National Defense Service Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal for his honorable service. His captain deemed Lance Corporal Addington one of the finest marines he had ever known. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the ultimate sacrifice Lance Corporal Zachary Addington made for our Nation, and I urge the passage of H.R. 3821. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3821, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
AUTHORIZING ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY USES FOR MEDICAL PRODUCTS TO REDUCE DEATHS AND SEVERITY OF INJURIES CAUSED BY AGENTS OF WAR Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4374) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to authorize additional emergency uses for medical products to reduce deaths and severity of injuries caused by agents of war, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

U.S. F OOD& DRUGADMINISTRATION , Silver Spring, MD, November 14, 2017. Senator JOHNMCCAIN, Chairman, Senate Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC. Senator JACKREED, Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAIN AND RANKING  MEMBER REED: Thank you for your commitment to our Nation’s service members and for your leadership in enhancing the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) medical countermeasure authorities and collaborations with the Department of Defense (DoD). FDA shares your goal of protecting our Nation’s military service men and women by advancing safe and effective medical products, strengthening our partnerships with the DoD on behalf of our Nation’s warfighters, and ensuring that this critical work is prioritized by the Agency. Our Nation’s troops face unique risks on the battlefield, and my colleagues and I at the Agency are committed to implementing a lasting framework that not only considers these unique risks, but prioritizes the warfighters’ needs by expediting the development and review of medical countermeasures needed in the face of emerging threats. The bipartisan bill that will be considered alongside the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 would codify these commitments to ensure that the warfighters’ needs for safe and effective medical countermeasures are met on a priority basis and in strong partnerships with DoD. For instance, I believe this new authority and enhanced collaborations with DoD will help enable FDA to approve freeze dried plasma as soon as 2018, addressing a key medical priority. Further, it will put in place a permanent process for strong engagement between FDA and DoD on any future medical products DoD determines are necessary to address military emergencies. Additionally, under these provisions, FDA would be able to recognize military threats in advance and provide an emergency use authorization for a fuller range of medical products that could help save lives on the battlefield. Thank you again for your dedication to our Nation’s service members and for working with FDA on this meaningful framework to better serve and protect our warfighters. Please be assured that I am personally committed to this effort. I will make it one of my highest priorities as Commissioner to rapidly implement the framework that is called for under this legislation and work with my colleagues at FDA and DoD to create an enduring pathway for the efficient development and prioritization of products intended to help save the lives of military personnel on the battlefield. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me as we implement these new authorities. Sincerely, SCOTT GOTTLIEB , M.D., Commissioner of Food and Drugs. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, our men and women in uniform have put their lives on the line for this country, and they deserve to have the earliest possible access to medical products that could save their lives on the battlefield. H.R. 4374 will establish important new authorities for the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, and the Department of Defense, DOD, to ensure that our warfighters have the benefits of new treatments and new devices. Mr. Speaker, currently the FDA has the authority to authorize the emergency use of an unapproved medical product for a specific set of military emergencies. They have that authority. This emergency use authority requires two things, though. First, the Secretary of Defense must make a determination that there is a risk of attack on military forces with a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent. Next, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must make a declaration that there is, in fact, an emergency or threat justifying the emergency use authorization of a product. To ensure there are no unnecessary delays in this process, this legislation, H.R. 4374, establishes a deadline for the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Once the Secretary of Defense 
makes a declaration of an imminent risk of attack, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has 45 days—that is the maximum—to make a declaration that such a risk exists. Limiting the threat under which an emergency use can be authorized to chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents, frankly, has been too narrow to incorporate all the serious threats of harm to our troops. To address this problem, H.R. 4374 establishes a new category under which the emergency use authorization process can be triggered. H.R. 4374 expands this authority to include situations where the Secretary of Defense makes a determination that there is risk of attack with any agent that may cause an imminently lifethreatening and specific risk to the United States military forces. In addition to creating new pathways for emergency access to unapproved medical devices, H.R. 4374 also creates a new breakthrough designation to expedite actual FDA approval of medical products for military emergencies. Currently, the breakthrough pathway exists only for products intended to treat serious, lifethreatening conditions where the Secretary determines such a product may demonstrate significant improvement over existing therapies. b1600 Mr. Speaker, this expedited approval is based on the successful breakthrough designation created by Congress back in 2012. This has worked. It has accelerated oncology drug reviews by more than 2 years. Now, in short, H.R. 4374 addresses the critical issue of military access to the newest available products by expanding the circumstances under which emergency use authorizations can be issued and by establishing an expedited pathway to full approval of products that the Secretary of Defense requests. Mr. Speaker, policies in this bill are bipartisan. They were developed with the input from the administration as well as the authorizing committees in the House and the Senate. Additionally, CBO has indicated that H.R. 4374 will have no impact on direct spending or revenue. So, Mr. Speaker, this is not only a good bill, it is an important bill for our men and women in uniform, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4374. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today we are considering legislation that would authorize additional emergency uses for medical products in response to the needs of the Department of Defense in the instance of a military emergency. Like all of my colleagues, I want to ensure that our military personnel who put their life in harm’s way for our freedom have access to the medical products that they need, and I have supported and will continue to support policies that further the goal of protecting our troops from lifethreatening risks. However, these policies also have to be balanced to ensure that, in our effort to protect troops from harm, we are not inadvertently exposing them to additional risk from unproven products. That is why I was disappointed to learn that the National Defense Authorization Act conference report included a policy supported by the Senate that would have given the Secretary of Defense authority to authorize emergency access to unapproved medical products, an authority that solely rests within the Food and Drug Administration today. This provision was not the subject of hearing and debate, did not receive the congressional oversight it should have, and I believe decisions of such consequence should go through regular order, providing Members and stakeholders with the opportunity to learn fully of the risks and benefits associated with transferring regulatory oversight of medical products to an agency that is not equipped with the expertise and medical product knowledge of the FDA. While I am not pleased with the process and how it has unfolded, I do support H.R. 4374 because I believe it will maintain emergency use authority with the agency that has the resources and scientific expertise needed to make decisions about access to unproven medical products. It is solely the FDA that has been charged with weighing the risks and benefits of medical products and making determinations as to their safety and effectiveness, and this legislation maintains the FDA’s important role in that process. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4374 not only addresses the Department of Defense’s concerns about access to medical products in instances of military emergencies, but it also goes further by providing them with additional support, in this instance, to expedite the development and review of medical products that are of priority to the Department. It also commits FDA to regularly meeting with the Department of Defense to discuss their priorities and product pipelines. So I just want to thank FDA Commissioner Gottlieb, Chairman WALDEN , Senate Health Committee Chairman ALEXANDER , and Ranking Member MURRAY for working to find a compromise that will maintain proper regulatory oversight over emergency uses of unproved medical products, while also ensuring that our Nation’s military has access to the products that they need in a military emergency situation. I do urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from New Jersey as we work on this together. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS ), chairman of our Subcommittee on Environment and a veteran himself. (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, it is great to be on the floor today. It was an awesome opportunity to be a conferee on the National Defense Authorization bill. As a veteran, 5 years active Army Infantry, 23 in the Reserves, I don’t get a chance to do that very often because I am on the best committee in Congress, which is Energy and Commerce. But to be able to be in that process, I am very appreciative to you and to the other conferees. It was then that you learn what you learn, and the military had a problem. They had a longdelayed issue on freezedried plasma that is inexcusable, and they took action in the legislative language to rectify that delay, and we would, too. But the legislative process worked. I also want to commend my colleagues on the minority side and Ranking Member PALLONE because what we want for our men and women in uniform, we want them to get an expedited pathway to lifesaving devices and drugs. But we also want to make sure that those things are safe, and the premier institution for safety and efficacy is the Food and Drug Administration. Now, we have a new administration that probably wouldn’t have had an 8 year delay on freezedried plasma, and we have a new administrator of the FDA who has committed to reform these processes. But good intentions are not all that we need. We need legislative language. We need to enshrine these changes in the law, and this is a good example, when I used to teach government history in high school, of how government works: House bill, Senate bill, go to conference. Even after a conference, it wasn’t just right, so the legislative leaders went to work to fix this. The changes have been identified by both the ranking member and the chairman, but the bottom line is the FDA needs to have the opportunity to look and expedite the drug. And we actually give them a shot clock for those people in harm’s way, to make sure that drugs and devices are available to our warfighters, that it is safe and secure and delivered in a timely manner. This is the least we can do for our men and women in uniform. I thank my colleagues on both sides, and I thank Chairman THORNBERRY . Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I don’t have any other speakers at this time, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS ), who I believe is also a West Point graduate. We appreciate his counsel, and I concur. I appreciate working with the House Armed Services Committee and its very able chairman, my friend, MAC THORNBERRY . 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), the chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, a doctor himself and a veteran. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4374 because our Nation’s servicemembers deserve the best and safest medical treatments available, especially when they are in harm’s way. This bill fixes a provision in the FY 2018 NDAA which passed the House overwhelmingly just yesterday, which would have allowed the Secretary of Defense to approve the emergency use of medications that have not yet received FDA approval. Under today’s legislation, we ensure the FDA will review any emergency DOD request for the use of unapproved medical products on an expedited basis while maintaining the FDA’s critical role of evaluating the safety and effectiveness of treatments. This new authorization will include situations when the Secretary of Defense determines the risk of attack with an agent that may cause an imminently life threatening and specific risk to the United States’ military forces. As a physician and a veteran myself and the chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I have worked tirelessly to ensure our Nation’s servicemembers have access to the best, safest, and most effective medical treatments available while they are in service and after. While we all want these breakthrough treatments made available to our Nation’s men and women in service as quickly as possible, we need to make sure that they are safe and effective before subjecting members of our Armed Forces to unproven treatments in the interest of expedience. I have personally spoken to the FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb on this issue, and he assures me that the FDA will work in a collaborative way with DOD to ensure the processes work more effectively for our troops. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. COFFMAN ), a great public servant who has served our Nation, I think, in two different uniforms and is a terrific member of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4374, having served in the first Gulf war when military analysts were saying or predicting that there could be 30,000 coalition casualties in a ground war with Iraq. We knew that Saddam Hussein had both chemical and biological stockpiles, and, at that time, there was an experimental drug given for the pretreatment to increase the survival after the exposure to nerve gas. It was untested in terms of the FDA, did not go through their lengthy bureaucratic process, but it was, I think, correctly assumed by military leaders that the risk of giving this drug that didn’t go through all the bureaucratic processes that I think are important, that the risk of nerve gas exposure outweighed those risks. So I just want to commend the Energy and Commerce Committee as well as the leadership of the Armed Services Committee, the leadership of both committees, for working together with the Department of Defense and the FDA to find that middle ground where the military can have access to drugs and medical devices expeditiously in order to meet the rapidly changing threats on the battlefield. I again thank Chairman THORNBERRY  for his unyielding support on this issue. I also thank Chairman WALDEN  for offering legislation that seeks to put this process on the right path. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ), a terrific member of our Conference and of the Armed Services Committee, again, a practitioner of medicine, a saver of wounded people, including our own whip of the House. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4374. This provision would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to authorize additional emergency uses for medical products to reduce deaths and severity of injuries caused by agents of war. Having served as a combat surgeon in Iraq, I understand the importance of being able to administer lifesaving treatments at a moment’s notice. Our servicemembers going into harm’s way must be confident that their corpsmen, medics, docs, and health professionals are equipped with the latest technology to save lives every time. Freezedried plasma is used during the initial resuscitation of combat casualties. Since 2011, 24 severely injured U.S. troops have been treated with freezedried plasma provided by the French, who have used this successfully since 1994. Of those patients, 17 lives were saved due to rapid treatment with freezedried plasma. H.R. 4374 is important because it puts a process in place to broaden the definition of military emergencies and provides the Department of Defense with access to expedited FDA processes for the investigational products like freezedried plasma. I support Chairman THORNBERRY ’s unwavering leadership on this issue. With rapidly developing medical technology, the FDA must be part of the modernization and readiness of our Armed Forces. We are committed to ensuring that the FDA does the best it can for our deployed forces, and I hope that we can find a way to enable the FDA to consider approved research and clinical studies from our allies in an effort to aid their approval process. The future will likely bring more medical devices and drugs that can save lives. Having a process to approve and implement emerging medical technologies is a matter of life and death, especially for our brave troops. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. b1615 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, you have heard from my colleagues the importance of this legislation. We found a good balance with our friends in the Armed Services Committee and in working with the FDA and with the leadership of the Pentagon to get this right. What matters most to Americans is that we take care of our warriors on the field when they are injured, and when they are in harm’s way that we are doing the best possible thing we can for them. Mr. Speaker, I think this is important legislation. I encourage my colleagues to vote for it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation. I do think it is a good compromise dealing with these military emergencies, but at the same time making sure that the FDA, which has responsibility for approving medical products, still retains its authority. Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DONOVAN ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4374. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to make votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 635 and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 636. 
RECOGNIZING THE DEEP AND ABIDING FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign Affairs be discharged from further consideration of the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 92) recognizing the deep and abiding friendship between the United States and Israel, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
H. C ON. RES. 92 Whereas the Jewish people have had a homeland in modernday Israel for more than 3,000 years; Whereas, on November 2, 1917, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Lord Arthur Balfour wrote to Lord Walter Rothschild, to be declared to the Zionist Federation, a letter declaring, on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom, support for a home for the Jewish people in the former Ottoman district of Palestine; Whereas this letter, known as the Balfour Declaration, was ratified by the League of Nations on July 24, 1922; Whereas, on September 21, 1922, President Warren G. Harding signed House Joint Resolution 322, after unanimous support from the House of Representatives and the Senate, favoring the establishment, in the former Ottoman district of Palestine, of a national home for the Jewish people; Whereas the Balfour Declaration clearly recognized and sought to uphold the ‘‘civil and religious rights of the existing nonJewish communities in Palestine,’’ as well as the ‘‘rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country’’; Whereas the Balfour Declaration was a significant part of the chain of events that led to the establishment of the modern State of Israel on May 14, 1948; Whereas since Israel’s founding, it has been a strong and steadfast ally to the United States, and the relationship is built on a mutual commitment to shared values; Whereas Israel serves as a beacon for democracy by holding free and transparent elections and promoting the free exchange of ideas; Whereas in April 1998, the United States designated Israel as a Major NonNATO ally and in 2014 was elevated to the status of a Major Strategic Partner; and Whereas the 100th Anniversary of the Balfour Declaration offers an opportunity for recommitment to strengthening the relationship between the United States and Israel; Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress— (1) affirms its commitment to maintaining the strongest of bilateral ties with the State of Israel; (2) recognizes the importance of the establishment of the modern State of Israel as a secure and democratic homeland for the Jewish people, without prejudice to the rights of all people to live within or alongside Israel in peace; and (3) supports efforts to continue to increase economic, security and cultural ties between the United States and Israel.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 4 hours, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) each will control 2 hours. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 1, the bill currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today the full House begins consideration of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, historic tax reform legislation that will revitalize our economy and provide lasting tax relief to Americans of all walks of life. Over 30 years have gone by since the last overhaul of our Nation’s tax system. In that time, our Tax Code has become one of the most complicated, unfair, and uncompetitive in the world. Today it is impacting nearly every aspect of Americans’ lives, and not for the better. The overwhelming complexity of today’s system forces American taxpayers to spend billions of hours and billions of dollars every year just filing their taxes. Trillions of dollars in carveouts and loopholes give favoritism to Washington special interests while hardworking Americans get nothing but frustration. With some of the highest tax rates in the world for our businesses, we are seeing goodpaying American jobs and manufacturing plants move overseas one after the other. Today, with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we change all of this. With this bill, we have an opportunity to deliver the most transformational tax overhaul in a generation. But make no mistake, this bill is not about us. It is not about Congress. This bill is about—for the first time in decades—providing the American people with a simple and fair tax system, so much so that nine out of ten Americans will be able to file using a simple postcardstyle system. It is about finally rewarding hard work, growing jobs and paychecks, and allowing Americans to keep more of their hardearned money to use on whatever is important to them. So if you are one of the millions of Americans who is sick of today’s Tax Code, you are going to see a remarkable difference. You will see the standard deduction doubled, increasing to protect more of every paycheck from taxes. You will have a larger child tax credit, providing more support as you raise a family and care for your loved ones. More Americans will get help raising their kids. You will have peace of mind when it comes to life’s most important investments because this bill preserves tax benefits to help you afford your home, to pay your property taxes, and put your kids through college. So if you are a typical middleincome family of four making $59,000 a year, you are going to get a tax cut of nearly $1,200. More than that, you are going to enjoy the benefits of a strong, healthy, and growing American economy. You are going to see more jobs on Main Street. With this bill, our small businesses will finally have low tax rates and a fair Tax Code that works with them as they grow and create jobs. You are going to see our larger businesses—our iconic American brands and our major manufacturers—win throughout the world and create new, goodpaying jobs right here at home because, with this bill, we are going to have one of the most modern and one of the most competitive Tax Codes on the planet. That includes lowering our corporate rate from 35 to 20 percent, which beats many of our international competitors. Not only are you going to see jobs stop leaving the United States, you are going to see our Nation become a 21st 
century magnet for job creation and business investment. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the American people will see and help lead the way in launching a new era of Made in America innovation. In the end, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a striking alternative to the broken Tax Code we have today. It represents a bold path forward that will allow us as a country to break out of the slowgrowth status quo once and for all. Mr. Speaker, the American people have waited years—decades—for a fair, simple, and competitive Tax Code. Right now, in this moment, we stand on the doorstep of delivering the most sweeping tax overhaul since President Reagan’s reforms in 1986. Like President Reagan back then, President Trump is now putting his full support behind this effort. Let’s pass this historic bill and take another step forward in delivering bold, progrowth, profamily tax reform for Americans throughout this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted the chairman mentioned President Reagan. But he made it sound as though President Reagan did tax reform on his own. Tax reform in 1986 was done in a bipartisan manner. I guess we just leave out Speaker O’Neill and we just leave out Chairman Rostenkowski and we just leave out Senator Bradley or Congressman Gephardt. The reason that they are left out is because even though it was accomplished in 1986, it started in 1982 when Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Bradley introduced the first tax reform act. b1700 What happened in those intervening years? The Ways and Means Committee took testimony from 50 witnesses. They held 30 markups and an untold number of hearings. Contrast that with what we did in the Ways and Means Committee: not one witness, not one hearing, not one opportunity to hear from renowned economists, labor leaders, or individuals who would have great knowledge not just of what happened in 1986, but what could happen in this Chamber. Instead, we are going forward with this illconsidered effort. This is a missed opportunity. This is a bad deal for millions of Americans in the middle class. The legislation puts the wealthy, the wellconnected, and the strong, once again, at the top. Thirtysix million Americans are going to receive a tax increase. When they talk about tax simplification, take a look at the phaseins and phaseouts of this measure. That is hardly simplification. It is greater complexity. Oh, by the way, the corporate rate is made permanent. The individual issues phase out after 5 years. Consider this: 13 million people will lose their health insurance based on what Republicans are doing in the United States Senate. They are going to lose their healthcare to pay for a tax cut for people at the very top. Let me just walk you through some of these provisions because I think that they deserve our attention and the magnifying glass of critical analysis. We are being asked tonight to borrow $2.3 trillion to pay for this tax cut. This is from people who regularly lecture the American electorate on the need for fiscal austerity and balanced budgets. When Barack Obama was President, the budget should be balanced. When Bill Clinton was President, the budget should be balanced. But in the intervening period of time, apparently, we don’t have to balance the budget. Also, $2.3 trillion is being added to the debt and deficits. We are witnessing what they are attempting to do because they are going to scale back the tax benefit for buying a new home by lowering the cap on mortgage interest deduction to $500,000. That is going to lower home values. H.R. 1 repeals the new markets tax credit. The historic tax credit that has transformed American cities is being eliminated. They beat up on the municipal bond market. As a former mayor, I have some knowledge of the municipal bond market. They are getting rid of the private activity bonds. Years ago, I raised the cap so that we might do more intervention and innovation in terms of rebuilding our airports across the country. Private activity bonds are a key for financing affordable housing. It is going to go by the wayside if they have their way. It is going to have a profound impact on the housing market. They eliminate several deductions and exclusions that help pay for college education, including a deduction for interest on student loans. Pay attention to this number. Student debt in America is at $1.3 trillion, and they are taking away the ability of students to deduct that interest on those loans. They also impose a new tax on universities and colleges. They repeal the abovetheline deduction for teachers’ outofpocket expenses. You know, those teachers who, in September, might be short some school supplies and they are good enough to pack the car up and bring it to school? We give them a $250 deduction. They are going to take it away. They create a health tax, an Alzheimer’s tax, by repealing the medical expense deduction. This change basically scraps a family’s ability to receive financial relief when dealing with serious medical conditions. Think of it this way: We celebrate annually the increases in life expectancy in America—80 for a male, 81 for a female. But if we are going to celebrate that, we also have to acknowledge something else: more dementia and more Alzheimer’s as people grow older in America. So their decision is: Let’s take away the ability of individuals to deduct those expenses. They also want to write off a very important consideration for the middle class in their ability to deduct real property tax costs up to $10,000. Contrast this with what these tax cuts do for the wealthy. H.R. 1 repeals the estate tax, which is paid by a small number of families in America. They are going to repeal it. I guess the slogan becomes: We are rich, and we are not going to take it anymore. That is not a tax on Conrad Hilton; it is a tax on Paris Hilton. That is what we should be considering with the greater efforts on their side to further concentrate wealth. By the way, there is an issue I have worked on for decades here, successfully, because 27 million middle class families no longer pay the alternative minimum tax. But guess what they are going to do? They are going to eliminate it for 4.5 million of the richest families in America. They are going to take away that payment. This is a missed opportunity, Mr. Speaker. This could have been done the way Chairman BRADY indicated in 1986: hearings, markups, a genuine effort to find common ground on this. On our side, I have waited all these years to do this. Tonight and tomorrow, what you are witnessing is that they need a victory. That is what this is about. It is a victory in search of a policy. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds. Mr. Speaker, I will note that, in the district of my good friend from Massachusetts, the average family of four making $87,000 will see a tax cut of $2,032. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROSKAM ), chairman of the Tax Policy Subcommittee and a leader in the tax reform effort. Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Massachusetts said this is a missed opportunity. This is no missed opportunity. What we are witnessing is the seizing of an opportunity. During the debate, our friends on the other side of the aisle, in 25 hours of markup last week, offered amendment after amendment after amendment. I think it was about 25 amendments. Do you know what every one of the amendments did, Mr. Speaker? It restored the status quo. It put something back in, put another thing back in, defended something else, and so forth. There was no comprehensive offer of an amendment in the nature of a substitute that would have been transformational. There is no exclusion here. We debated. We are now here, and for the first time since 1986, we are on the cusp of seizing an opportunity and having a transformational moment. Here is the transformation: 
When the Tax Code was last amended 30 years ago—think about it—the internet didn’t exist as a commercial enterprise. Yes, it has fully developed, and we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday. The global nature of supply chains were nowhere nearly as intricately interlinked, yet we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday. The shared economy—Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, all of those things—didn’t exist, yet we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday. Who does the status quo benefit, Mr. Speaker? It benefits the few. It benefits the privileged. It benefits the folks at the top of the economic scale of things. So what this is doing is proposing a very different approach. It says we are going to make the United States the most competitive jurisdiction in the world by giving business tax relief and welcoming back commercial enterprise and growth and prosperity and ingenuity and investment—that does what? It creates paychecks and it expands opportunities. Kids graduated from college shouldn’t have to grub around piecing together two jobs and living in their parents’ basement. How absurd. We can do much better. We are the biggest, best economy in the world, and it is time we acted like it. This is transformational. To lean back and away from this and say, oh, this Tax Code is a natural disaster; it is too big and too overwhelming and we can’t deal with it is nonsense. We fundamentally reject that. We are going to be measured in the future, Mr. Speaker, by this moment. I thank Chairman BRADY for his leadership in creating this crescendo, because now is the time to act. Let’s not defend the status quo. Let’s move forward, and let’s transform this economy. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I am for maintaining the status quo by allowing students to deduct their student interest loans. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that the Republican tax scam gives massive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires and corporations, and they do it, in part, by increasing healthcare costs for millions of Americans. Over 36 million middle class households will see a tax hike under this bill. Families with big medical bills will take the hardest hit. That is because Americans will no longer be able to deduct major medical expenses such as cancer treatment or Alzheimer’s from their Federal income taxes. This is a middle class tax hike. Seven in ten households using the medical expense deduction make under $75,000 a year. Repealing the deduction would especially hurt seniors who use it for longterm care expenses. The bill takes a second swipe at American seniors and people with disabilities. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by not paying for tax cuts for the wealthy, Republicans would trigger automatic cuts to Medicare, slashing $25 billion from Medicare in 2018 alone. But the $25 billion cut to Medicare is just the beginning. The same Republican budget that cleared the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for the superwealthy proposed cutting Medicare and Medicaid by, no coincidence, $1.5 trillion. Now, Senate Republicans want to pay for additional tax cuts by repealing a key part of the Affordable Care Act. This change would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million and increase premiums by 10 percent. Middle class families, people with disabilities, and seniors struggling to afford healthcare should not foot the bill for billionaires to get a tax cut. I urge my colleagues to make the healthy choice for Americans and vote against the Republican tax scam. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. REICHERT ), chairman of the Trade Subcommittee and a champion for working families. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership in bringing this tough piece of legislation. I mean tough in the sense that it has taken years to put this together and at least 40 hearings on the legislation that is presented today. Mr. Speaker, when I travel my district from the suburbs of Auburn, Washington, to the orchards of Chelan, I hear the same thing from middleincome, hardworking families, from the apple grower in Wenatchee, the tech entrepreneur in Issaquah, and the growing family in Maple Valley, Washington: They want to keep more of their hardearned money, plan for the future, and they want to have some certainty in their future. They want to care for those they love. They deserve a plan that gives them the opportunity at their first job or a better job. They deserve a chance to decide how they want to spend their money. It is their money. Why wouldn’t they deserve that chance? They want a Tax Code that is simpler, fairer, and that works for them. They want the same bright future for their children. This is a bill that is not just a tax bill, but it is a bill that reignites, in my opinion, the belief in the American Dream. In the Eighth District of Washington State, the median income family of four will receive a tax cut of $3,654. In Washington State, 21,875 new jobs will be created. This plan will change lives. It will energize our economy and get our economy booming again. As we went through this process, I asked myself several questions over the last few years, to be honest with you. Here are the questions: Will this plan make the American economy boom again? Will this plan create jobs in America? Will this plan increase paychecks? Will this plan put more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans? Will this plan make the Tax Code fairer and simpler? The answer I came to and I think that Americans will come to, Mr. Speaker, is a resounding ‘‘yes.’’ b1715 Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, this bill phases out the deductions that benefit middleincome families. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEI DER). Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, we absolutely must reform our outdated and overly complex Tax Code, but the current bill this House is considering is not the way to do it. I have heard from constituents and local elected officials about how this plan will hurt them and their communities. Rather than lifting our economy and making our local communities stronger, this bill before us is an unfair and fiscally reckless step backwards. My constituents are deeply concerned with the restrictions placed on the State and local tax, or SALT, deduction. This puts a real burden on the residents of States like Illinois. One in three Illinois taxpayers uses the SALT deduction. Let’s be clear. The SALT deduction is not a tax break for the very wealthy. It is used by the hardworking families we need to be helping with tax reform, not hurting. I am also profoundly concerned about what this reform means for our growing debt. An additional $2.3 trillion in debt is irresponsible in the extreme, burdening our children and our grandchildren with the consequences. Now, with the most recent Senate version, the GOP is taking aim at the Affordable Care Act, repealing the individual mandate without a workable replacement to further reduce enrollment in the individual health insurance markets, making coverage more expensive for millions of Americans and their families. There are things we can do to improve the ACA. For example, delaying the looming taxes on medical devices and health insurance premiums has broad bipartisan support. We should be focused on solutions like these that improve, not dismantle, the ACA. Despite our willingness to work across the aisle, there was virtually no bipartisan engagement on the plan this House is rushing to vote on. It is not too late to change course. I urge my colleagues to take the time for full deliberation in a complete and bipartisan process. Together, we can produce real tax reform that is fiscally responsible, prioritizes the middle class, and grows our economy for the next generation. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. S MITH), chairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee and a champion for agriculture. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman BRADY for the time and for his leadership as we continue our efforts to pass this historic legislation. Mr. Speaker, after nearly 7 years of work in the Ways and Means Committee and more than 31 years since our last true tax reform, many hearings along the way, it is time to pass historic comprehensive tax reform. Our current Tax Code is antiquated, as we know. It is complex, and it ignores many of the improvements and competitiveness, which have been adopted by every other major economy worldwide. The time for tax reform is now. Others have already outlined many of the highlights of this bill, but I think they warrant mentioning again. Simplified compliance and rates for individuals and families means more than 95 percent of Americans will be able to file their returns on a postcard. Lower rates for small businesses recognize the important role they play as job creators in our economy. A 20 percent top corporate tax rate and transitioning to a territorial system will ensure our businesses remain competitive with the rest of the world. In addition to lower rates, expanded expensing will further encourage entrepreneurs to invest in capital to grow their businesses, and full repeal of the death tax, including the continuation of stepup in basis, will ensure our Nation’s farmers, ranchers, and small manufacturers can continue creating opportunity for generations to come without the threat of double taxation. Our Tax Code shouldn’t reward businesses and investors because they hired accountants and lawyers to help them avoid taxes, and the estate tax does exactly that right now. I think it is equally important to praise what the bill leaves alone in the Tax Code. With our impending entitlement crisis, we want Americans to save everything they can for retirement. This bill leaves those incentives intact. It also excludes a proposal, which had initially been included in the bill, to apply selfemployment taxes to rental income. This could have had serious repercussions for ag land rental, and I am glad it was dropped. And I particularly appreciate how this bill continues the deductibility of State and local taxes for businesses, including farmers and ranchers. U.S. producers have made great strides in increasing production on a peracre basis, but land remains a primary input as they work to feed the world. Ensuring the property tax on land and production remains deductible as business cost is vital to their continued success. This is the moment to finally provide the tax relief Americans have been asking for and to make our country competitive again. I urge the passage of this progrowth bill. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, more than 100,000 Nebraska households making under $137,000 a year will see a tax increase under this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. CAPUANO ), my good friend from Somerville, Massachusetts. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am a former tax lawyer. My wife is a practicing CPA. We have heard this before: simplification is going to help. It has never put a single accountant out of business, and it won’t do it now. It is another part of the big scam going on. Why? Sure, I will probably get a tax break out of this; some of my constituents will. But what do we get in return? We don’t get healthcare. We don’t get better roads. We don’t get better education. But we do provide a $5,000 to $10,000 debt for our children. We do tell our seniors: Too bad if you have a heart attack or cancer; no more medical deductions for you. We tell our current graduate students: Too bad, no deductions for you. And on and on and on. And by the way, we have a new provision in here that I like to call the ‘‘Dynasty Protection Act.’’ Why? Because if you have a dynasty, if you are worth $30, $40, $50, $100 million, your children get to keep it all. Not because they have done anything, but because they won the genetic lottery. Good for them. And then if they do get up off their butt and get a job, maybe start a hedge fund with all the money they inherited, they get another tax credit by not touching the special tax deals—you have the hedge fund managers. And if they earn a little extra money, they get to keep more of it because there is no alternative minimum tax left. I know that President Trump will particularly appreciate that provision because we all know—the only tax return we have seen—the AMT cost him $31 million. So thank you from the rich. Now, I don’t have any problem with people being wealthy. I represent many of them. They don’t want this tax cut because they know it is bad for America. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, as a final insult, the corporate tax you have encourages businesses to send jobs offshore by not taxing profits made offshore when they expand jobs, if they do. They will do it offshore, not here in America. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Massachusetts will gain 24,000 jobs; families will see a $3,000 increase in their paychecks. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN), a key member of our committee and a leader in technology and employee stock options. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, for the first time in a generation, middleincome and hardworking Americans are closer to a Tax Code that works for them rather than against them. It has been 31 long years since we last reformed our broken tax system, and, in that time, our Tax Code has become one of the most complicated, unfair, and uncompetitive in the world. It has led to a stagnant economy and sluggish growth. American businesses of all sizes have some of the highest tax rates in the world, sending our jobs, our manufacturing, our research, and our headquarters overseas. And you know, the economic recovery hasn’t been all that great since the Great Recession—not that great for a lot of Americans. Half the population is living paycheck to paycheck. Many either have or are at risk of having a lower standard of living than their parents. Young people, like my daughter’s generation, will go backwards if this country is not fundamentally more competitive. And then seniors and those baby boomers preparing for retirement, who have a lifetime of savings, are now at risk without a growing economy. The reforms in this bill today will help real people with tax cuts aimed to help middleincome families that want to save for the future and improve their own standard of living. The bill focuses on helping small businesses, Main Street Minnesota businesses with a simpler, clearer, and fairer Tax Code that is critical for job creation. It lowers small business rates to 25 percent and even provides a 9 percent rate for the smallest Main Street startups. Modernizing the Tax Code is essential to allowing American businesses of all sizes to compete around the world and bring those jobs home. We need to be able to sell where the customers are, and 95 percent of the world’s customers are outside the United States. The international reforms in this bill will incentivize businesses to bring their money home to invest in our communities. And importantly, this bill includes bipartisan legislation that I authored, the Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act, which helps those entrepreneurs and startups attract and retain talent. Hardworking taxpayers, Mr. Speaker, deserve a Tax Code that is simpler, flatter, and fairer so that every American family and employer can file their taxes without having to hire an Army of lawyers and accountants. Mr. Speaker, we have a choice. The choice is Americans. We can either truly grow the economy and put ourselves back on the path to real prosperity, or we can continue the actual trend we have right now of weak economic growth, which only benefits the few and the privileged and will do nothing for regular folks when the next economic downturn hits. Tax reform for me is about one thing and one thing only. It is about restoring hope for a prosperous future for 
ourselves, our parents, and, most importantly, our children. I want to thank the chairman for his guiding leadership through this effort. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, 40 percent of Mr. PAULSEN ’s constituents claim the SALT deduction, a benefit of over $15,000. They are lucky to break even after this tax bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND), a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, there are certain phrases that we have learned to grow to accept with great suspicion: The check is in the mail. It is not you; it is me. Don’t worry, I will respect you in the morning. I have had just a few drinks; I am fine with driving. And now we have to add to that: Don’t worry. Large tax cuts for the most wealthy will pay for themselves, and I am a fiscally conservative Republican who cares about debt and deficits. The Joint Committee on Taxation has determined that, with interest payments, this bill will add over $2.3 trillion, with a T, to our national debt over the next 10 years. That is why last week, in committee, I was offering an amendment that would expand the endangered species list to include fiscally conservative Republicans because your vote on this bill will make you extinct. And what is unfortunate is, unlike past tax cuts that weren’t paid for, we have run out of time. We no longer have the luxury of time to recover from a huge fiscal mistake, not with 70 million baby boomers beginning their massive retirement—10,000 a day joining Social Security and Medicare. Those programs and the solvency of Social Security and Medicare will be in jeopardy with another $2.3 trillion of debt over the next 10 years. And what is unfortunate, it didn’t have to be this way. There was bipartisan interest in simplifying the Code, making it more competitive, broadening the base, making it fair for working families and small businesses and family farmers, but doing it in a fiscally responsible way. Asking 34 million Americans to accept a tax increase to pay for a 43 percent marginal rate reduction to the largest companies is hardly responsible, and it is hardly fair. I encourage my colleagues to let us take a different approach and reject this bill. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACK ), the chair of the Budget Committee who cleared the path for this progrowth tax reform. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his endless hours of work listening to everyday people, listening to small businesses, listening to large businesses, listening to how what we put in this bill was going to affect the American people who, at the end of the day, are going to be the winners. So it has been more than three decades since Congress has worked with the White House to modernize our Nation’s very confusing and complicated tax system. Just ask anybody who has filed their taxes on their own. But we are closer to changing that day with H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And with this budget, with the budget passed in both Chambers and following last week’s productive markup in our House Ways and Means Committee, tax relief is on the horizon. With this legislation, Republicans clearly recognize the need to do something about our heavy tax burden weighing down the hardworking Americans and holding back job creators. We also recognize the need to bring simplicity to the Tax Code. In our tax reform plan, we will help low and middleincome Americans see more of their hardearned paychecks by lowering the tax rates and nearly doubling the standard deduction for individuals and married couples. b1730 For instance, for an average middle class family of four, that translates to a $1,200 tax cut. Now, I will tell you, that is real money. We also establish a new family credit that raises the child tax credit and introduces new credits for family members and other dependents. The Tax Code will also become less confusing, making it possible for most Americans to file their taxes on a single postcard. Our plan, rightly, provides tax relief for job creators, empowering entrepreneurs and small businesses to continue opening, operating, and expanding on Main Street. For my home State of Tennessee, H.R. 1 will allow families to see an estimated $2,200 increase in wages. Again, that is real money. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentlewoman. Mrs. BLACK. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, this bill would also mean 20,000 new jobs for my State. This will provide a welcome jolt to our economy, which is badly needed following eight lackluster years under the Obama administration. Without question, enacting tax reform is a challenge, but the benefits of seeing it through will be felt for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We cannot miss this historic opportunity. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, over 350,000 Tennessee households making under $132,000 will see a tax increase with this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ), a leader on the Higher Education Subcommittee and well known nationally as a spokesperson on education issues. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. NEAL for his tireless leadership pointing out the trail of broken promises that are in this bill for middle class families, who will pay dearly with higher costs for healthcare, home ownership, and, in many cases, Federal taxes. I would like to zero in for a minute during National Apprenticeship Week on the broken promise that the bill represents to growing the U.S. economy, which has a shortage of skilled workers. The obliteration of the student loan interest deduction, which will add $24 billion to the cost of higher education; the taxation of graduate students’ tuition waivers, 60 percent of which are concentrated in STEM curricula; and the elimination of taxfree employerfunded tuition assistance, to enhance workplace skills, often using apprenticeship programs, moves this country in exactly the wrong direction to close the skills gap in our workforce, which we all know every Member in this body has heard about from employers back home. Indeed, America’s CEOs told the President last February at a White House manufacturing summit: Jobs exist, skills don’t. In fact, the Trump’s Labor Department reported 6.1 million job openings in the month of September, a near record high. Sadly, this antigrowth tax bill robs American job seekers and employers of the tools to fill those jobs, ironically, during National Apprenticeship Week. Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members of this body to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MEEHAN ), one of the key members of our Tax Policy Subcommittee and a champion for working men and women. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to take advantage of this historic opportunity that we have before us. As I travel across my district, I hear from families that are struggling to get ahead. I hear from families that can’t make ends meet most months. They don’t have a whole lot left over. In fact, 63 percent of American families don’t have $500 to handle an emergency. I hear from businesses that say they would love to be able to hire, expand, or buy that new piece of equipment, but they just don’t have the cash to do it. Our Tax Code is taking too many dollars from Pennsylvania and sending it to Washington. It is sending goodpaying, middle class jobs overseas and it is holding our economy back, making it harder for so many to get ahead. This is our chance to change the status quo. We have an opportunity to jumpstart our economy and let more hardworking families keep what they earn. We rewrite the Tax Code for American job creators, taking away the incentives to send jobs overseas and dollars offshore. Putting those dollars to 
work will put more Americans to work as businesses expand and invest here at home—American tax cuts for American workers with American jobs. We give these small businesses a break—the momandpop shops that employ Pennsylvanians. We give entrepreneurs, who have so much innovation and creativity, a wider cushion to take a risk. We are putting more money in the pockets of hardworking families. We are doubling the standard deduction, which means that 94 percent of taxpayers won’t need to itemize at all. Let me say that again: 94 percent of taxpayers won’t even need to itemize at all. By expanding the child tax credit and creating a new $300 credit for parents and nondependent children, we put an additional $1,800 back in the pockets of every family of four. That is money that they can use as they see fit. We have streamlined the maze of education tax credits, and included in my bipartisan bill are apprenticeship programs that can now be made affordable. The taxpayers I hear from say they want to pay less in taxes, not more. If limiting some deductions and lowering your rates means your tax bill is lower at the end of the year, that is a good deal for taxpayers. We owe it to the hardworking, taxpaying families we represent to deliver that. I urge my colleagues to support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, all of those projects in Philadelphia are about to come to an end with the abolition of the historic tax credit. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN), who, incidentally, is a CPA and a tax attorney. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, by 2027, roughly onethird of middle class families will be paying more in taxes, and that average family will be paying $1,300 more. The personal exemption, worth $4,150 per person in a family, that is $21,000 for a family of five, and they take it away. The moving expense deduction, if you have to move to keep your job, you don’t get to deduct that. But if you move a factory to China, you get to deduct all of the moving expenses. The student loan debt, they won’t let you deduct it. As for the effect on simplicity, my CPA and tax law homeboys are going to be rolling in big dollars. Just from the provisions that define the difference between personal service income, passive income, active business income, the litigation and planning opportunities—talk about complexity—it is all there, and my homeboys love it. We currently deduct extraordinary medical expenses. That is important to those with disabilities and families with children with special needs. They wipe it out. The extraordinary casualty loss deduction, they wipe out. That is very important to people who face floods and fires. They change the rules so that we don’t have adequate indexing for inflation, so everybody is pushed into a higher tax bracket by inflation, except those at the very top; they are protected. But look at the effect on our Nation’s economy. This is a jobkilling, deficit exploding, growthreducing disaster. Look at what happened to Kansas. These policies have already devastated one of our States. You are going to be taking $1.5 trillion out of the money available for business investment. The Federal Government will come in and borrow all of that money, leaving less money for factories, farms, and homes. As RONKINDpointed out, there is an extra $800 billion of interest on top of that just in the next 10 years. Keep in mind, this increase in our debt is forever. Your grandchildren will be paying taxes on this debt. Look at the chart. We had the policies of Ronald Reagan from 1988—when his 1986 law became effective—through 1993, and we had 2.67 percent growth. In 1994, we got Clinton tax policies and we exploded to over 4 percent annual growth. Then with George W. Bush, we dropped to 1.7 percent growth. Then when we adopted Obama tax policies, which are in force today, we are back up to 2.2 percent economic growth. Which policies give you economic growth? Let’s look internationally. You can manufacture and pay zero percent on the profits you earn by a factory, but only if it is a foreign factory. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. SHERMAN. Finally, Mr. Zandi, one of the top economists in the country, testified before our Financial Services Committee that this bill means doubledigit declines in the value of homes in American metropolitan areas. What effect does that have on the economy? Who is going to go out and spend in the middle class when they are told that the equity in their home has been virtually wiped out? So you can vote against this bill because it is unfair, or you can vote against this bill because it will be a crushing weight on our economy, but don’t engage in the fantasy that you can cut taxes and make it up through ‘‘economic growth.’’ Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, under tax reform, California will grow 111,000 new jobs, and paychecks will increase by nearly $3,000. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. NOEM), a champion of familyowned farms and businesses. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We have worked hours—literally hundreds of hours—on this legislation, and I commend Chairman BRADY and the staff of the Ways and Means Committee for all of their hard work. Mr. Speaker, we have gone through this bill line by line. I have personally fought for policies and ideas in this bill to make sure that it works for families, to make sure that it increases wages, and creates more opportunity for folks all across America. My goal in this was twofold. Number one, I wanted to strengthen families. Number two, I wanted to create a stronger future for America. This tax reform package puts us well on our way to achieving these goals and achieving some remarkable wins for the American people. I say this because this plan simplifies the Tax Code. It simplifies it to the point that most people can file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard. It also gives significantly lower rates. It dramatically expands the child tax credit. It keeps the child care credit. It protects flexible spending benefits. These provisions for working families are important to me. My home State of South Dakota has the highest rate of working families in the Nation. The moms and dads in my State aren’t working just for fun. They are working to pay the bills to provide for their families. They need money to put food on the table and to put a roof over their kids’ heads. These provisions are going to help them pay their bills, take care of their kids, go to work, and maybe, just maybe, get a little extra money that they can take their kids off for a weekend and do something fun together. That is important. When these kids grow up, I want them to be able to find good, highpaying jobs. So I fought hard to make sure that our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses could thrive under this new Tax Code. We got some pretty big wins for those folks. In this bill, we fully and permanently repeal the death tax—that unAmerican, unfair double tax. We give people better expensing tools and we drive down the rate for small businesses. If we are going to make sure that our kids can thrive, we need to create opportunities for them to make sure that they can do it right here in America, and this tax reform package lets hardworking job creators do that better. Mr. Speaker, I understand that no tax reform plan is going to be perfect in everybody’s eyes, but this proposal is a strong step forward. It reflects real, sustainable policy changes that are going to let people keep more money in their pockets. I have heard from many throughout this debate, who have spoken up against these tax cuts and these reforms—people who trust the government with this money more than they trust the American people. Mr. Speaker, I fundamentally disagree. The American people deserve more control over their paychecks. 
They have worked hard to earn that money. They have taken time away from their families to earn that money. They ought to be the ones deciding how, where, and when to spend it. So for the purposes of strengthening families and offering folks a stronger future here in America, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, 38,000 South Dakota households making less than $113,000 a year will see a tax increase under this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the highly regarded gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ), the son of Massachusetts and my friend. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, you can put all the lipstick you want on this pig, and it is still a pig. Let’s be honest, this isn’t tax reform. This is a cut on taxes for corporate America, the corporate friends and my friends on the other side of the aisle, and they had to squeeze all kinds of things in to justify it and pay for it. That is why the middle class is going to suffer. That is why their kids in college are going to start losing their ability to deduct interest on student loans, and they are going to pay taxes on waived tuition when they get a teaching assistant position or a benefit from the university. b1745 That is why your local municipalities are going to lose tax exemption for private activity bonds that fund tens of billions of dollars of public improvements all over the United States. That is why 8.8 million Americans are going to lose the ability to deduct medical costs. Good luck to families who have to put people in nursing homes for longterm care, patients suffering dementia. How will they work that financing out when they lose this deduction, and how will they feel when they know the reason they are losing this deduction is to finance a corporate tax rate? What about homeowners losing the ability to deduct mortgage interest or to have it capped artificially so corporate America can get the biggest tax cut in history? And, by the way, they get to continue to deduct State and local taxes and other kinds of financial interest related expenses, but not you, not you the middle class. It adds $1.5 trillion, and that is with dynamic scoring. Dynamic scoring is another way of saying: We kind of fudged the real number. It is more than that, at least $200 billion more than that. I thought my friends on the other side of the aisle were fiscal hawks dedicated to making sure we didn’t have deficits. This is an inconsistent bill. This is going to harm middle class America. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill, and let’s start over in a bipartisan way. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman’s constituents in Virginia’s District 11, with average household earnings of $136,000, with two kids, will see a tax cut of $5,008. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to engage in a colloquy. Mr. Speaker, I want to first commend Chairman BRADY and the Ways and Means Committee for their outstanding work on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will provide tax relief to millions of hardworking families and businesses. I would like to address a small provision in the bill that inadvertently impacts Berea College, a small private college in Berea, Kentucky, that is a member of the federally recognized Work Colleges Consortium. Work colleges, by definition, do not charge their students tuition, and they also require their students to hold jobs. For over 125 years, Berea College has fulfilled its mission of providing a tuitionfree education to students with limited economic resources, primarily from Appalachia, and who are often firstgeneration college students. Berea pairs its strong academics with a student labor program, honoring the dignity and utility of all work. Berea could not fulfill its unique and special mission of providing free tuition to all students without a healthy endowment. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a 1.4 percent excise tax on private college endowments over $500,000 per student. There are two federally recognized work colleges with endowments above this level, including Berea College in my district. I was pleased to learn that the Senate version of the bill exempts schools with fewer than 500 tuitionpaying students from the excise tax. This provision would effectively exempt work colleges from the tax, because they do not charge tuition. I understand it was never the committee’s intent for this legislation to negatively impact work colleges that use their endowments to provide tuitionfree education. In fact, I understand the intended purpose of the excise tax is to encourage colleges to use their endowments to keep college costs down. In this case, Berea College uses its endowments to defray 100 percent of the cost of tuition. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his willingness to work with me on a solution in conference, either acceding to the Senate position or another mutually accepted solution that exempts work colleges and allows them to continue their unique mission. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BARR. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his leadership here. Mr. Speaker, we will work together for a mutually accepted solution to make sure we exempt work colleges to use their endowments to provide tuitionfree education. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), a wellregarded champion of middleincome people. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and also for his tremendous leadership on the Ways and Means Committee and for really telling the truth. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, H.R. 1, which really is a tax scam. Republicans are really trying to pull a fast one on the American people. This bill would steal from the hard earned paychecks of millions of middleincome families to line the pockets of billionaires and corporations. In fact, 80 percent of the tax breaks would go to the top 1 percent. It also eliminates student loan deductions and eradicates medical expense deductions. If this isn’t cruel enough, this bill makes it easier for corporations to ship jobs overseas, so people will actually lose their jobs. This tax plan does nothing to create better jobs or better wages or a better future for the middle class. It does just the opposite. In my home State of California, one in five middleincome families will see a tax hike next year. The State and local tax deduction would be particularly hard on my State, where 6.1 million households will see a tax increase. Public sector jobs, like firefighters, will lose their jobs, not to mention the vital services our most vulnerable will need. These will be cut. This bill really is a disgrace. Stealing from families who need help the most to give more to donors—millionaires and billionaires and corporations—this is really a new low. Thirtysix million middleincome households, working families, will pay more in taxes. We can’t forget, also, that this tax scam sets the stage, really, for a heartless $1.5 trillion cut to Medicare and Medicaid, as we saw in the Republican budget. We need to reject this meanspirited tax scam and vote ‘‘no’’ and then come back and look at how we can support middleincome families, working families, so everyone has a chance and an opportunity at the American Dream. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would note that the constituents in California’s 13th District, a median family of four earning $107,000 will see a tax cut of $2,589. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ). Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this opportunity to discuss the historic preservation tax credits that historically have stimulated nearly $150 billion in private sector investment. 
As we have discussed over the last month, the tax credit is critically important for economic development and revitalization, especially in small, rural areas of this country. Without the credit, projects that transform communities in all 50 States, from West Virginia to Texas, to Wisconsin, simply will not happen. Mr. Speaker, the chairman’s word means something to me, so I am asking for his commitment to continue working with me to ensure that the Federal historic preservation tax credit is preserved in the final tax reform package. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MCKINLEY. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. MCKINLEY for his passion about making sure our smaller communities can revitalize and grow and about the role of the historic preservation tax credit in doing that. I commit to working with him and continuing to work with him on this issue because I know the importance of it. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and I look forward to working with him as well. We have had a good working relationship over the years. I want to continue this process because I understand this process. I will be voting to continue the process in anticipation that it will be in the final bill. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK ), a valued member of our delegation. Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member for yielding and for all of his incredible work on this bill. Mr. Speaker, we were promised tax reform, but that is not what we are seeing in this bill. In fact, you don’t have to dig far into this 429page bill to see that it is a con, a cynical bait and switch for families at home. When this bill was released just 2 weeks ago, I started getting calls from families at home wanting to know how it would affect them. We dug into it, and I want to share just a few of those examples, but it didn’t take long to see why it was developed in secret and why it is being rushed to a vote. On page 254, Republicans propose getting rid of a program that helps veterans find work when they come home. 300,000 veterans have been helped by the work opportunity tax credit. The repeal of this provision to reduce taxes for the very wealthiest is a coldhearted way to say thank you for your service. On page 113, this tax scam sends a bill to 9 million households who have extremely high medical costs. Tax breaks for billionaires are expensive; we get that. Under this plan, Americans who live in nursing homes, have a sick child, high medical costs will foot the bill. On pages 95 and 97, students get added to the list of Americans who will be forced to pay for the GOP’s tax breaks for corporations. They will see increased debt and taxes. This bill says: Good luck, students. Building an economy that will not allow you to pay off the $1.3 trillion of existing student debt but, instead, will add $2.3 trillion in deficit, this bill was created for you. Just yesterday, the President’s chief economic strategist was surprised when the CEOs gathered admitted they would not be investing their tax cuts in jobs and wages. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GARRETT ). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, he should not have been surprised. Corporations are already sitting on record amounts of cash while generations of hardworking Americans have had to pay for tax experiments like this based on disproven economic theories. Let’s not repeat the mistakes of the past. Let’s reject this bill and work together to create bipartisan tax reform that is fair and benefits all families. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in the Fifth District of Massachusetts, a median household of four earning $143,000 will see a tax cut of $5,208. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. REED), one of our key leaders on tax reform on the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his hard work in putting this bill together. Mr. Speaker, this bill has been in the process for over 7 years in regards to the time I spent on the committee. There have been multiple hearings on the issue of tax reform, well over 40 plus. There have been hours upon hours of debate. There were efforts done by our former chairman, Dave Camp. I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have recognized, during our committee markup process, the hard work that Chairman Camp did with rewriting the entire Code from the bottom up. These issues have been out there for the American people and for the people from across the country to look at, to digest. Now is the time to rise in support of this legislation, Mr. Speaker, because what we have before you is a new Tax Code for the 21st century. Mr. Speaker, we have a Tax Code that is going to, for once in 31 years, put our corporations on the multinational level across the world in a competitive position by lowering the rates and getting to a 21st century taxing program on a territorial basis. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, we deliver tax relief. I know the folks on the other side aren’t going to agree with this because they are going to say this is a Tax Code for the rich, this is a Tax Code, tax reform for the rich and the almighty 1 percent. But, Mr. Speaker, I have done the math. I have looked at this bill inside and out, and it delivers a simplified Code where $1,600 is left in the pockets of my constituents in western New York. That is $1,600 that they earned that the government won’t have to take from them anymore; $1,600, Mr. Speaker, that will allow them, as senior citizens, to go visit their grandkids in the South because New York State has driven them out of New York State with its high tax policies at the State capital. That is $1,600 that maybe they can go on a trip with their family and experience a little relaxation because of the hard work that generated those moneys and those dollars in their pockets. Mr. Speaker, these are the people whom we represent, the Perrys. Mr. and Mrs. Perry are hardworking people of western New York, and those are their two beautiful children. What this is going to allow them to do is get a little bit more of their money kept in their pocket so they can spend a little bit more time with their kids and enjoy the fruits of their labor. b1800 Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues on the other side advocate because there is another issue with tax reform that I want to highlight real quick. The easy approach of government is to spend more money, develop more programs, and maybe give a little bit in regards to a government welfare check. But what this Tax Code and reform does is deliver a job opportunity for these people, and I don’t know a better program in America that serves more people than an honest day’s work and an honest paycheck and an honest job, and that is what this Tax Code will do. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, correction. Not one hearing was held on this tax bill. Thirtyeight thousand people in Mr. REED’s district will lose the student loan interest deduction. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), a real champion of the working class in America. Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, Ranking Member RICHARD NEAL, for his exceptional leadership in trying to fix this horrendous bill. Madam Speaker, the GOPled tax and deficit disaster rewards the big corporations and billionaires. It will accelerate job outsourcing. Indeed, 50 percent of the tax benefits go to the top 1 percent. This tax scam locks in—get this—a $621,500 tax bonus to each billionaire in the billionaire class, the top onetenth of 1 percent. Do you really think they need it? Meanwhile, this tax scam raids money from the pockets of 38 million middle class taxpayers, likely those caring for their sick relatives or trying to help their kids in college. Do you 
really think the onetenth of 1 percent need more? Moneytrading Wall Street megabanks like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, already making billions, will get more tax bonuses courtesy of the middle class. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CHENEY). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. NEAL. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. KAPTUR. This job outsourcing tax bill of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich, well, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck, and this duck belongs in a swamp, which voters may have thought they were draining in the last election. Well, folks, this bill makes the swamp wider and deeper, and the fat ducks will be even fatter and happier in it. I urge my colleagues to vote for the middle class, not the billionaire donor class. Vote ‘‘no.’’ Drain the swamp. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I am proud the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for that family of four in Ohio, in the Ninth District, a $64,000 household, will see a tax cut of $1,284. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ). Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for working diligently to create the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will give a tax break to the middle class. After speaking to both Speaker PAUL RYANand Ways and Means Committee member TOMREED, I believe that an unintended consequence of this bill would hinder middle class Americans pursuing a higher education degree in an attempt to better their lives. These consequences will affect the education of employees of universities, graduate students, and employees receiving employerprovided education benefits. Madam Speaker, under current law, higher education institutions can provide taxfree tuition waivers or reimbursement to employees, spouses, and dependents. Secondly, many universities provide graduate students, including Ph.D. candidates, with tuition relief and stipends, which they can utilize while pursuing their degree. Several of my constituents, including my niece, Sarah Schiavone, who is a Ph.D. student, would be impacted by this. Thirdly, employerprovided education incentives are currently not taxed. I offered two amendments, amendments 20 and 21, to H.R. 1 that would have kept these qualified tuition reduction benefits and currently would have provided for them to continue. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I inadvertently cut the gentleman short. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. TURNER. I know the Senate is working on their version of the tax reform package, and, as of today, the Senate bill does not include the repeal of these vital education permits. Mr. Chairman, I would like your assurances that the current status of these education benefits will be protected during conference debate. I am requesting you continue to work with my office as we, together, address this issue. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. TURNER. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. It is a privilege to be able to work with the gentleman on this issue, and, Mr. Chairman, it is a privilege to work with you. With eight colleges and universities in my district, I cannot ignore the impact that eliminating this section that Mr. TURNER eloquently explained—the impact it may have on the students and the employees in my district at all of those institutions. The University of Illinois, the largest university in my district, provided $184 million in tuition waivers to 1,387 faculty and staff last year alone; 1,100 of those employees made less than $75,000. I am worried, too, that that is going to have a tremendous impact on graduate students. I am worried it is going to have an impact on the custodians and the assistants in the Registrar’s Office who are just working at these institutions to be able to send their son or daughter to college. So I look forward to working with Mr. TURNER and Mr. Chairman and working toward a solution. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. TURNER. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. TURNER  and Mr. DAVIS for raising this important issue. On the committee, Representatives MEEHAN and L YNNJENKINS  led the discussion and share your sentiments. I have a keen interest in this issue. I will work with you toward a positive solution on tuition assistance in conference with the Senate. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ), who is a son of Springfield, Massachusetts, and a very distinguished gentleman. Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I have a few questions for the authors of this bill. What do you have against students? You are imposing an opportunity tax. A young Vermonter who wants to get a certificate in welding, or get a degree from our community college, and gets tuition assistance from an employer, they have to pay taxes on that. If they borrow money from the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, they have to pay more because they can’t deduct that interest. By the way, the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation has to charge higher interest because we are eliminating private activity bonds, and they don’t get the benefit of their municipal bonds rate. I have another question. What do you have against teachers? They reach in their pocket at the beginning of school to help out with school supplies. They lose the deduction. I have another question. What do you have against people who have a loved one with Alzheimer’s? They can’t deduct the cost of that medical care. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. WELCH. Well, I have another question for the Chair, and I ask it of the leadership. What happened to democracy? We were promised an open process. And there was a model for this. It was President Reagan and Dan Rostenkowski, 4 months of actual hearings, witnesses testifying about the bill. This was written in secret. Oh, by the way, no amendments. Now, we could ask 435 Members of Congress whether we should stick it to the students like we are doing in this bill, and 435 of us would all stand up for the students. But you know what? Not a single one of us is given the opportunity to ask the question: Do we want to stick it to our students who want to get a welding degree or a college degree? That is disgraceful, it is inexcusable, it is within the control of the majority, and they are denying us the opportunity. Here is the big deal that we know. This bill was written by and for the donor class that has flooded and contaminated this political process with billions of dollars in our campaigns. Madam Speaker, I say defeat this bill. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for families of four in Vermont, making $89,000, will see a tax cut of $2,030. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ), one of our key leaders championing for small business. Madam Speaker, I also ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROSKAM ) be permitted to control the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his work. Madam Speaker, I can’t tell you how grateful I am to cast a vote to move our Tax Code one step closer to its first overhaul in 31 years. We know the Tax Code is broken. The American people know the Tax Code is broken. They are reminded every time they look at their paycheck. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will deliver progrowth tax reform to the families, farmers, manufacturers, and workers in my district. 
For families, we are delivering tax cuts so that hardworking Hoosiers can keep more of their hardearned money. We are enhancing the child tax credit, preserving the Adoption tax credit, encouraging retirement savings, and streamlining 15 different education tax incentives. We are delivering a Tax Code so simple that most Americans can file taxes on a postcard. In my district, 80 percent of filers already take the standard deduction. They will be able to keep even more of their money, because the standard deduction is doubled, and most itemizers will now be able to save time, money, and stress by taking the double standard deduction instead. No one is ever excited to file their taxes, but I am all for a simpler, quicker process that makes it much more painfree. H.R. 1 helps job creators grow. Small businesses get a lower rate and more simplicity. Family businesses passed down for generations won’t have to worry about the estate tax anymore, and America will be a more attractive place to do business. Our antiquated Tax Code keeps investment in jobs out. This bill incentivizes companies to bring profits back, to locate facilities here, and to grow American jobs and raise wages. Madam Speaker, I was so proud to vote for this bill in the Ways and Means Committee, and I am proud to be a part of this House that is delivering yet another crucial step toward tax cuts, simplicity, and fairness. Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, the University of Notre Dame is about to get slugged with a new tax, and the clock is running out. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), who has been a champion of the working class. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member NEAL. I appreciate this time. Madam Speaker, my heart is heavy tonight, and it is heavy because we are faced with the absolute, most dangerous, destructive, and deceitful tax reform bill in the history of this Congress. Now, let me tell you why. On the other side, you have heard Member after Member on the other side get up and tell you: This is going to get a tax cut, we are going to give the wealthy a tax cut, we are going to give the corporations a tax cut. But none of them have told you, or the American people, how they are going to pay for it. And the great tragedy is, the most deceitful thing about what my colleagues on the other side are doing to the American people is they are doing these tax cuts for the wealthy, the tax cuts for the corporations, on the backs of the poor, the middle class. Let me tell you why. They won’t tell you that they are paying for this tax cut because on—$1.5 trillion that they will cut from Medicaid, from Medicare. Madam Speaker, Medicaid is for the children. There are literally millions of children on there. You heard one of my colleagues go down. We are losing 20 veterans to suicide every single day. No mention of that. Yet they will cut the veterans program designed to help them to pay for this tax cut. Not to mention the student loan interest rate. Young people across this country, you need to rise up. Seniors, we need to rise up. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. We need to rise up and stand and fight for this country. Let our minds go back to 1770, in Boston, at the harbor, when they threw the tea over that founded the foundation of our great democracy. I ask the American people to stand up and help us Democrats defeat this dangerous bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. b1815 Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, the good news is that the good people of Georgia’s 13th District median household income, family of four, at $80,000 would receive a $1,700 tax break. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT ), former treasurer of one of the largest counties in our country. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, this is one of those moments where— and forgive me, but I sometimes feel like I live and work in a mathfree zone, because you can’t intellectually have it both ways, where you are talking about the great difficulties coming, and then when you bring in the actual data and you actually start to look at the charts that we all see, it isn’t in the future, it is right on the cusp of us, and that is the debt and entitlement crisis. If we do not start to get some economic growth, we are in so much trouble. If you really care about Medicare, Medicaid, the children, this education program, this health research, where is the money coming from? It is on the cusp. This is less than a decade away. In just a few years, we cross 100 percent of GDP, and that is publicly held, and then the ability to sell the bonds if we do not get economic growth. But if you look at the last 30 years in the charts and the data—and I am sorry, I know this is small and I know it is math, so it is uncomfortable for a lot of people in this body. If you actually look across here and you see, this is entitlements to GDP, when we have been in times of economic expansion, all of a sudden our ability to finance, to maintain the promises we have made as a society, if the math works. And this is a commonality we both understand, economic growth is our only path. Because if it is not, are you on your side ready to do fairly draconian cuts? If we actually look at some of the data that has come from the Tax Foundation, the Tax Foundation’s modeling says $1 trillion of additional taxes, but almost $300 billion in additional payroll taxes over the 10 years. I have already heard a couple people get behind the microphone here and use the term that the trillion and a half is dynamically scored. No. That is a static score. All dynamic scoring is— so we all have a commonality—you calculate back in the size of the economy. You loop back in the size of the economy, and you can’t have it both ways. You either support dynamic scoring or you oppose it for global warming. You oppose it for immigration. You oppose it for the stimulus, because we actually, as a body, every March, when CBO brings us the numbers, they give us a number that has been dynamically scored. I know we all want what is best for this Nation, but as I dig through the math, if we get the economic growth that I believe this tax model, so many of the very difficult decisions we as a body have to make over the next decade get much easier. Let’s hope we get there. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s sincerity as we proceed to watch them borrow $2.3 trillion on the deficit. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE), from a wellknown family. Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time and for his incredible leadership on this subject. You can’t have it both ways. I just heard it said. You can’t have it both ways. So what I suspect will happen after I get done, as has been the case with every one of the speakers on this side, the gentleman on the other side will say that residents in my hometown will get a tax break of X, $1,000. I would ask the gentleman if he would add to that the amount of the debt that is being borne by each one of those families. Because the way I have got it calculated, it costs a family of four about $20,000 for your debt that you are willing to levy against our children and grandchildren in order to give the richest 1 percent of Americans a massive tax break. You can’t deny the math that almost all the benefit goes to the people at the top. The top 1 percent are huge beneficiaries. You can’t deny the math that 5,400 families will get a massive tax break. You can’t deny the math that says that every single American will take on additional debt; a family of four, $20,000 in debt. I also was intrigued by the colloquy where Members came to ask the leadership if they will work with them to take out egregious elements of this tax 
proposal. We get this sort of ‘‘Yes, I will work with the gentleman’’ answer. I have a question: Why did you put it in in the first place? Why are you cutting brownfield tax credits? Why are you cutting new market tax credits? Why are you cutting historic tax credits in the first place? Why did you put it in in the first place? You just wrote the bill. You just wrote it. It makes no sense. It makes no sense. We can’t pass debts to our children in order to finance tax breaks for the people at the very top. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would like to remind all Members that they should address their remarks to the Chair and not to others in the Chamber. Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Madam Speaker, the good news is it is not just $1,000 for the gentleman’s district, it is $1,200. Let’s go right to this student issue. It was the Obama administration that proposed in the 2017 budget for the elimination of the student deduction. I think the sanctimonious need to just walk out of the Chamber. The other thing is, at a tax rate of 15 percent, an annual $2,500 abovetheline deduction is a $375 tax break. We are proposing something far greater than that with doubling the standard deduction, lowering the rates and so forth. Madam Speaker, let’s just take the student deduction and chuck it in the garbage. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ). Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, it is about time we get something real done for the American people. The people of Missouri’s Second District sent me to Washington to secure their jobs and to keep a little more of their hardearned money, and at long last we are finally doing just that. I vote ‘‘yes’’ to fix our broken tax system. I vote ‘‘yes’’ to help reignite the American economy. I vote ‘‘yes’’ to make it a little bit easier for that single mother of two, that firefighter, that teacher, that shopowner, that family of four, that veteran. I vote ‘‘yes’’ for bigger paychecks, better savings, and a more secure future. I ran for Congress to fight for the people of Missouri and to ensure that every hardworking American can realize their own American Dream. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ), a conscience of the House and a champion of all things Pittsburgh. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this terrible bill. Many of my colleagues have called it a scam, and they are absolutely right. Supporters of this bill have said that everyone gets a tax cut. That is not true. Millions of Americans get a tax increase; more and more each year, in fact. Supporters of this bill have called it a middle class tax cut. That is not true. The lion’s share of the money goes to corporations and households making $1 million or more, not to the family struggling paycheck to paycheck. What this bill gives to the middle class in one hand, it takes it away with the other with devastating consequences for households with high medical costs, student loans, or high State and local taxes. Supporters of this bill have claimed that it will keep companies from moving jobs overseas, create new jobs here at home, raise wages for American workers. That is not true. While this bill cuts corporate tax rates, it creates new incentives for shipping our jobs abroad. Finally, does anyone really believe that tax cuts for corporations and the rich will trickle down to the rest of us? It didn’t work in the Reagan administration. It didn’t work in the Bush administration. It didn’t work in Kansas, and it is not going to work today. Make no mistake, this massive tax cut for corporations and the rich will increase deficits and the national debt by trillions of dollars, sticking the rest of us, especially our kids, with the bill. Madam Speaker, this massive tax cut for corporations and the wealthy is not a middle class tax cut. It won’t create jobs or raise wages. It isn’t simple, it isn’t reform, and it certainly won’t pay for itself. If we want to increase economic growth, let’s give a real break to the middle class and the small businesses. They will put that money right back into the economy. That is the way to create jobs and boost wages. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this giveaway to the rich and to start over with a bipartisan bill that truly benefits the middle class. Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle need to make a decision: Do they want to lionize Ronald Reagan or criticize Ronald Reagan? I will leave it to them to decide which. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to adamantly dispute this false narrative that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is only intended to benefit the wealthiest Americans and does not benefit the middle class. When you hear this fiction from the other side of the aisle, remember these facts: this bill lowers tax rates on low and middleincome Americans. It takes the lowest 10 percent bracket to zero. It doubles the standard deduction, meaning hardworking Americans can immediately take home more of their paychecks. Specifically, the first $24,000 of family income will be completely tax free under this plan. By slashing our noncompetitive corporate tax rate, this bill will result in more jobs and, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, it will deliver average American households a pay raise of at least 21⁄2percent. With this legislation, a typical family of four earning $59,000, the median household income, will receive a $1,182 tax cut. Madam Speaker, that is not a tax cut for the rich. That is a tax cut for low and middleincome hardworking Americans, and that is a fact. This will benefit people like Jared from Frankfort, Kentucky, who told me: ‘‘The extra income from the tax cut will enable us to have some breathing room.’’ It will also help constituents who are living paycheck to paycheck, who have told me they would use these tax cuts to save for a rainy day, make car repairs, occasionally go to a restaurant, and invest in higher education for their kids. I heard from my constituent in Lexington named Gary, who told me: ‘‘It doesn’t matter how I plan to use my money. By definition, it is my money to begin with. Trust me to spend it in the way that applies for me.’’ Gary, you are absolutely right, it is your money. Tax relief is not about handouts. It is simply about allowing the American people to keep more of the hardearned income that they made. On behalf of all of the hardworking people of central Kentucky, I urge my colleagues to vote for Gary and to vote for all other taxpayers who deserve to keep more of what they earned. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), who is well known and well regarded as he addresses national economic issues. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this. The last time there was tax reform was 31 years ago. Since then, 96 percent of income growth went to the top 10 percent of the people in the country. Ninetysix percent went to the top 10 percent. The top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth in this country. Sixtythree percent of average families in the United States of America could not withstand a $500 emergency. We have pensions collapsing, we have communities that have eroded, wiped out, and the Republican plan to fix all of this is to go to the Chinese Government, borrow $2.3 trillion and bring it back to the United States and give it to the wealthiest people in this country. That is not going to fix a damn thing in the United States. It is not going to help Flint, or Springfield, or Youngstown, or Pittsburgh, or Gary. I am talking about Gary, Indiana, will get hammered from this thing. b1830 We have tried this before, and many of you were here. President Bush did 
this. He said: We are going to cut taxes for the wealthy. It is going to lead to growth. Wages are going to go up. We had the most stagnant decade of growth since the Great Depression, and it ended in a complete economic collapse. This is a canard. This economic philosophy stinks. It doesn’t work, and it hammers working class people. To put a little salt in the wound, Madam Speaker, you keep the deduction that allows a corporation to outsource jobs from our communities to other countries. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, the only place this is going to create a job is in Beijing, China. Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, as you know, the good news is, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 70 percent of the individual tax relief goes to families earning under $200,000, according to their publication on November 13. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ). Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I think no one in this Chamber can dispute when I say that America’s Tax Code is broken. I rise today to stand with my colleagues in support of progrowth tax reform because our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act works for the middle class. For too long, a complex Tax Code, high rates, and burdensome regulations have held back opportunities for hardworking families. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act offers muchneeded tax relief for lowincome and middleincome Americans. It focuses on middle class tax cuts that allow hardworking Floridians to keep more of their paychecks so that they can save for their children’s college fund, so that they can invest in their retirement, so that they can enjoy vacations with their family. Florida families know how to spend their money better than the government, and this plan allows them to keep more of the money that they earn instead of waiting for tax returns and deductions to give them their money back. This bill is profamily. It is probusiness, and it will give our economy a boost. Nothing will address our debt more than growth. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ), wellknown as a champion of America’s middle class. Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member of the committee for his hard work on this. He has been a great voice. Madam Speaker, this is a harmful and deceitful bill. It is strictly partisan. We have learned over the years, if you do something strictly on a partisan basis, it isn’t going to work. It is going to fall apart. It will come back to you. I am telling you, learn from our mistakes. Work with us. There hasn’t been a single hearing on this bill. Is the public out there confused? They should be because they haven’t been informed about what this bill does. It was rushed through in 1 week. It takes more than a week to name a post office around here. What is the deal? What is going on here? No one really understands the consequences of this bill, but I can tell you what it does. It will greatly reduce taxes for corporate America. It will reduce taxes for the wealthy. So where do you think the money is going to come from to pay for Social Security? to pay for our roads and highways? to pay for our education? to pay for Medicare? If you haven’t guessed, it is going to come from the middle class. There is no other way we can pay for this. So I will be kind and say maybe they are being overoptimistic. Maybe they don’t really understand what is going on there, but don’t believe it. You are going to pay more taxes. It is going to come out of your hide. And when I sit down, the Member from Nebraska is going to say that, in my district, you are going to get $1,200 more or $1,700 more. No. You are going to pay more. You are not going to get more money back. In California, 6 million people will lose their tax deductions, the State income tax deduction. What does that mean? That means you are going to pay taxes twice on your earned income. In California, homeowners are going to get hit hard. I don’t see how anyone from California can vote for this bill. Education will be more expensive; student loans will not be deductible. This bill will hurt our Nation’s ability to compete. What does that mean? It means lower pay. It means layoffs. This tax overhaul is a big lie. We should oppose this bill and start over and do it right. Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, the good news is it is not $1,200. It is not $1,700. It is $1,900 for the median household in California’s Ninth District. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH), a great friend of agriculture and a great friend of small business. Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, a lot has been said today on the floor about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from my friends on the other side of the aisle. They think that this bill before us will make losers of the American workers or of the American economy. The truth is the status quo—our current broken Tax Code—is causing our workers and our economy to lose. Back in southeast Missouri—I will give you an example under the current Tax Code—a machinist in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, working 40 hours a week is fearful to work harder because the more money that they make, the less that they will have percentagewise under our current Tax Code. That is simply not right, Madam Speaker. Back in southeast Missouri, a cotton farmer in Hayti has worked for decades to build his family farm hoping to pass it on to his daughter. Yet, under the current system, his daughter would have to sell portions of the farm or take out a massive loan to continue the family operation. The status quo in our Tax Code is rigged against the American taxpayer. They can’t afford an army of lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists to find all of the loopholes and the bailouts available only to a select few. The status quo are tax rates for businesses that are so high that the American companies are not able to grow, hire new workers, or be competitive with other countries around the world. The other side of the aisle was arguing to keep a broken Tax Code that is punishing hardworking taxpayers. All of the grandstanding leaves us with one question that needs to be answered for the American people: What do these tax cuts mean for you? It means that the hardworking family in southeast Missouri will keep more of their paycheck. Instead of being penalized for success, this bill is about employees. It is about wages. It is about getting to keep more of what you earn. For families and couples, the first $24,000 you earn under this bill will be tax free. You get to keep it. You get to decide how to spend your own money, not the government. It means that the small businesses and family farms won’t feel the sting of the IRS and the death tax when tragedy strikes their family. It means that lobbyists and special interests become the losers. We close loopholes in handouts that the hardworking taxpayer can’t get. We are ending a Tax Code that isn’t built for the everyday American. We are making it simple and fair. It means that America can now compete and win again. With this bill, we lower the business rate to historic levels. We are making our economy healthy again. We know from history that a healthy economy takes care of itself. It is more stable and sustainable. It provides for full employment, better jobs, and higher wages. Former President John F. Kennedy knew this when he said: ‘‘Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, surely, the lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by wildeyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic recessions. Any new recession would break all deficit records. This bill makes the American worker, the American family, the American farmer, the American small businesses, and the American economy winners once again. Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, 28,000 people will use the student loan interest deduction in Missouri’s Eighth District, claiming nearly $33 million in deductions. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ), a medical man and Congressman. Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member NEALfor the opportunity to speak on this bill. The fact is I do want to simplify our Tax Code and I do want tax reform, a tax reform that relieves the burden on our middle class, our seniors, our veterans, and our students. But let’s just see how this bill fares with the middle class, seniors, veterans, and students. My middle class constituents in California will be doubletaxed on their income, but big corporations will get tax relief. Veterans in my district will find it harder to find work or a home because this bill eliminates tax credits for hiring veterans and harms efforts to end veterans’ homelessness. Middle class homeowners across California will see the value of their homes decrease by as much as 10 percent. Students will get hit with the largest relative tax increase in this bill. Seniors will see a Medicare cut by $25 billion a year. That is over $100 billion of Medicare cuts over the next 4 years. And 38 million middle class families will see their taxes increase. They always point to this family of four earning $59,000 getting a certain amount of tax cuts, but 38 million middle class families will see their taxes increase, all this while giving tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and corporations who ship jobs overseas and raise the deficit by $1.44 trillion within 10 years. In fact, nearly 80 percent of the tax cuts in this bill go to millionaires, billionaires, and multinational corporations that ship jobs overseas. The bottom line is this bill raises taxes on the middle class and gives tax breaks to billionaires. This is irresponsible and unacceptable. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and protect Medicare, protect the middle class, protect seniors, protect veterans, and protect students. Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, if you are in California’s 36th District and your median household income is $58,000, it looks like a tax cut of $1,090. I am informed that our friends on the other side have more time, and my suggestion is that our friends use some of their time to get back in balance. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 1 hour 161⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I just happen to have the nephew of former President Kennedy here who is going to set the record straight on that quote that was attributed to President Kennedy just a few moments ago. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (MR. KENNEDY ), a very good member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation and my friend. Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and mentor in the House, the dean of our delegation from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), for his leadership on this issue and so many others. Madam Speaker, I am always heartened by the quotes of President Kennedy offered by any Member of this body. I would like to think that they would seek to emulate him not just on the marginal tax cuts that were put forth some 50 years ago, but also on his stance on immigration, on civil rights, and on Russia. b1845 But those are issues for another day, Madam Speaker. The issue today is a vote that we will take on this floor tomorrow to rewrite an American Tax Code that will touch every single American life. True tax reform is complicated, it is cumbersome, and, above all else, it is deeply personal. But this bill is none of those things. It is a massive, permanent handout to corporations passed off on American families. It is a terrifyingly precise attack on patients with chronic illness, a heartless roadblock for lowincome students, and a choice to value inherited wealth more than hardearned income. It is a gift to corporations paid to the richest among us, and it is paid for by long nights, by double shifts, by vacations not taken, and of hardworking American families sacrificing for their hope for a better tomorrow. You are asking them to fortify your tax cuts and stock options with their classrooms, your corporate profits with their roads and bridges, your balance sheets with their hardearned retirement and healthcare benefits. For all the talk about the boost to corporate profits, 80 percent of the stocks in this country are owned by 10 percent of Americans. Ask yourself who is going to actually be the beneficiary of all that money. That is what this bill does. You have heard from my Republican friends over the course of the past couple days about how much this will save the average American family, but not about the 36 million people and families who will experience a tax hike. What they aren’t telling you is what is going to happen the moment this bill is passed. Luckily for the American public, one of the chief economic advisers to the President has said so. He said that after this bill is done, they are turning directly toward welfare cuts, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. So when you hear questions about how much this bill is going to save you, ask how about your retirement. These cuts go right to Social Security. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts an additional 30 seconds. Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, ask them how much more money that $1,000 is going to save you when your healthcare benefits are taken away. By the way, that clause just got added over in the Senate. Ask them how much more some savings might go for one family when you gut and shred a social safety net that has powered the greatest expansion of economic growth that this country has ever seen. That is what your bill does. That is what this bill means. That is what this bill is about. It is about the values envisioned of an America, about a tax structure that should reflect the values of the American family, not the values of corporate balance sheets. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). Congressman RASKIN is a wellknown champion of civil liberties and a scholar of the law. Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, as my friends across the aisle prepare their statistics about my congressional district where 500 people rallied against the tax plan this last weekend, I want to invite them to come to my district and to debate me and several other members of our caucus. I am happy to come to the gentleman’s district and debate it, too, because the American people should be able to be part of this decision. When the majority voted to throw 30 million Americans off of their health insurance plans, they went over to the White House where they celebrated like it was Mardi Gras, the Super Bowl, and Herbert Hoover’s birthday all put together. When millions of middle class Americans rebelled and defeated that monstrosity of a bill, Donald Trump pointed at them and said that they had all voted for a mean bill; and he was right. Now like lambs to the slaughter, they are about to vote for another mean bill, a tax scam written by corporate lobbyists in the dark of night 
now moving through Congress at the speed of light. While our poor colleagues grimly walk the plank for the billionaires, Wall Street tycoons, and the Trump Cabinet, who are getting ready to laugh all the way to the bank when middle class Americans rebel again this week, next week, and the week after that, and this tax scam bites the dust, President Trump can turn around again and call this monstrosity not only mean, but greedy. This mean and greedy tax scam puts $1.5 trillion on America’s credit card so the sons and daughters of the middle class can pay the rest of their lives for a gigantic corporate tax cut in a period of record corporate profits. Onethird of the windfall raining down on corporate investors will go abroad because more than onethird of corporate wealth is owned by foreign investors. That is more than $500 billion that goes not even to our own rich people but to Saudi Arabia, China, and other foreign investor havens, and it will not go to Medicare or Medicaid or other public purposes at home. Then they move to the socalled territorial tax system so that corporate profits moved abroad will escape our normal system, giving incentive to record job flight. Somebody tell Donald Trump about this because this tax scam puts foreign jobs first. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an additional 1 minute. Mr. RASKIN. In the meantime, Madam Speaker, 34 million middle class Americans get hit with a tax increase. Goodbye to the healthcare deduction. Goodbye to the college loan interest deduction. Farewell to a meaningful State and local tax deduction— oh, and farewell to the estate tax which applies only to billionaires and the richest millionaires in the country, 2 out of 1,000 families. Where is the democracy? Where is the legislative process? When we had a bipartisan bill in 1986, we took more than 2 years. It passed with overwhelming support. Now this tax scam has had no hearings, no experts, and no citizen testimony. What a scandal it is. We do need tax reform, but we don’t need a corporate tax scam imposed against the middle class. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ), who is the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, which is just a continuation of Republicans’ relentless attack on working families. This is not a tax plan; it is a tax scam. This President won’t disclose how he is going to benefit from this tax scam. He has disrespected us all. This tax scam will eliminate the student loan interest deduction. It will eliminate State and local tax deductions on income. It will restrict the mortgage interest deduction. It is estimated that 47 million taxpayers face a tax hike. Almost half of any tax cuts will go to the richest 1 percent. Residents of my State of California will face the largest net tax increase totaling $12.1 billion in 2027 alone. Madam Speaker, I call on the President of the United States of America to show his tax income and to show his tax plan. He needs to let us know what he is all about and what his taxes are. From the very beginning, he said he couldn’t show them at the time that he was asked when he was first inaugurated into this Presidency, but time has passed. It is time for the President to show us his tax returns, rather than coming up with a tax scam asking everybody else to pay up, to pay more, and saying that this is a middle class tax cut when it is not. We want to know more about him and his plan. So with my 1 minute, my 2 minutes, whatever it is, this evening is all about saying a message to the President. Even though I will be cautioned that I am not to talk to the President, I am calling on the President: Show your tax returns. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, there is a message for California’s 43rd District, and that is a benefit of $1,395 if H.R. 1 is passed into law. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD). Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois for his commitment and dedication to this terrific bill that we have before the House tonight. Madam Speaker, the people of Illinois are unfortunately all too familiar with high taxes and the burden they put on families and our local businesses. At the Federal level, things have become just as bad with a Tax Code that is over 74,000 pages long and riddled with loopholes. Over 30 years have passed since the last time Congress passed comprehensive tax reform, and you can see the effects of our outdated Tax Code everywhere. We have stagnant hiring, stagnant wages, and a stagnant economy that is holding back our middle class instead of helping them get ahead. H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is our chance to change all of this. By simplifying our Tax Code and bringing real relief to everyday families, we can, once again, jumpstart the American economy and get it back to working for the middle class. The choice before us is a simple one: Do we support this bill and support the middle class, or do we embrace the status quo? That is why I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together and vote for this bill. Let’s send a signal that we don’t stand for the status quo. We stand for growth and economic opportunity for the American people. Let us bring relief to the middle class. Support this bill. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ). Congresswoman SEWELL is an attorney and a Marshall Scholar. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, our Tax Code is a statement of our values, and I can tell you that this tax bill doesn’t reflect my values nor those of the American people. This bill favors the wealthy over the middle class, it favors corporations over the working families, and it favors special interests over everyday Americans. Madam Speaker, this tax bill raises taxes for 36 million middle class Americans, and it cashes a check for $2.3 trillion worth of debt that will be left for our children and grandchildren to pay. This tax bill gives permanent tax cuts for corporations and multinationals while making the tax cuts for regular taxpayers temporary. This tax bill preserves tax deductions for certain industries but does away with tax cuts in the Code that help everyday Americans. It eliminates the deduction for State and local taxes. It also limits mortgage interest deductions and limits the medical expense deduction affecting 9 million households. The independent group, the Tax Policy Center, estimates that almost half of the tax cuts, 47 percent of the tax cuts, will go to the top 1 percent. Madam Speaker, this bill devastates education. Education is truly the investment in our human capital, our workforce. It eliminates deductions for interest on student loans. It eliminates deductions for teachers who buy supplies. It eliminates lifetime learning credits, and it eliminates employer tuition assistance. This bill adds a special tax on the endowments of colleges and universities which will reduce scholarships and increase the cost of college for average, everyday Americans. Cities and towns will be decimated by this bill. This bill eliminates tax incentives such as private activity bonds, new markets tax credits, and historic tax credits which dramatically affect the ability to build libraries and hospitals, and to fund roads, bridges, and broadband infrastructure. These are critical investments, Madam Speaker, in the public service that spur economic growth. Madam Speaker, this tax bill has it backwards. This Congress should value its constituents first, not Wall Street, and not special interests—its constituents first. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this tax bill because it doesn’t represent the values that our constituents sent us here to this hallowed place, Congress, to represent. We should be representing them and not the special interests. 
Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to just do a quick, little cleanup. There was a discussion a minute ago by the gentlewoman from Alabama where she was talking about teachers, for example. Let’s get right to that. Teachers won’t be harmed by shifting the status quo because what they are getting right now is a $250 deduction which is worth about $37 at the 15 percent tax rate, receipts that they have to keep all year long in an envelope and apply it at the end in terms of doing their taxes. We say: Dump that. Let’s get away from that. Let’s double their standard deduction, lower their rates, and give them some real money. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. MIMIWALTERS ). Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ) control the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise to engage the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ) in a colloquy. Madam Speaker, tax reform will result in economic growth across the country, especially in my home State of California. I thank the gentleman for his dedication to this important effort. Madam Speaker, my home State is uniquely positioned in this tax debate. Due to the liberal taxandspend policies enacted by the California State Legislature, my district in Orange County is one of the most expensive places to live in this country. California has the highest personal income tax rate in the country, reaching a crushing 12.3 percent. The median home price in my district is almost $800,000. California also has the highest gas tax in the country. While this bill makes important reforms that will grow our economy, I have serious concerns that some of my constituents may be worse off. As Sacramento continues to confiscate more and more of California’s hardearned paychecks, we must ensure that Washington does not put similar tax burdens on our constituents. I ask the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to assure me that we will ensure that individuals and families in my district are protected from such unintended outcomes. Mr. KNIGHT. Will the gentlewoman yield? Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. I yield to the gentleman from California. b1900 Mr. KNIGHT. Madam Speaker, if you want to demonize or scare people, you come down and yell and scream and raise your hand and you say things that they haven’t looked into. What I did was talk to people in my district and looked at their rates and said: Let’s look at your taxes and kind of work them through. I found that people in the lowerincome rate in my district got relief. People in the middleincome rate got relief. This happened right across the board to everyone we kept talking to. So I would say that, before you come down and yell and scream and try and scare people on something you might have heard from a talking head, actually work with your people. It works. Madam Speaker, if this bill is enacted, it will result in economic growth across the country, especially in my home State of California. The lower rates for individuals, families, businesses, and the tax simplicity and certainty offered by this bill will provide net tax relief to the middle class and our country’s job creators. We expect this bill to create nearly 1 million jobs nationwide, and nearly 10 percent of those in California. While the bill makes commendable strides toward a fair, simpler Tax Code, I am concerned about how the bill could impact some of my constituents as a result of the high level of income taxes imposed on them by our State government. I would ask the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee if he can assure me that we continue our work and ensure the families in my district are protected from such unintended consequences and that they will be able to fully enjoy the benefits of this bill. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Will the gentlewoman yield? Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank both the gentlewoman and the gentleman for stepping forward and being such strong advocates for taxpayers in a State that taxes its families and businesses, I think, almost beyond belief. Our goal in tax reform is to achieve tax relief for families and individuals across the country, regardless of where you live, and across all incomes, while, at the same time, unleashing the economic engine for American economic growth. California, by the way, under tax reform, is the number one job creator under the new Tax Code. So I agree with the gentleman and the gentlewoman. There are still some areas where we want to make and will make improvements in this bill. If they will work with us to continue to move this process forward, I am happy to commit to working with both of them to ensure we reach a positive outcome for their constituents and families as we reconcile our differences with the Senate. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, 33 percent of Mr. KNIGHT ’s constituents derive a $16,000 annual benefit from the State and local tax deduction. In the case of the gentlewoman from California, 37 percent of her constituents enjoy an $18,200 State and local tax deduction benefit. Madam Speaker, in closing, more than anything else, this is, as I opened with, a missed opportunity. We all know what is wrong with this Tax Code. We could have found areas of compromise emphasizing the middle class and middleincome earners. We understand that the Tax Code that American corporations use is not competitive now internationally, but we wanted some relief for middleincome people. So here is where the investment could have taken place. We could have begun an investment in human capital. You have heard it tonight. We should all be alarmed by labor participation rates in America. We all should be alarmed by what has happened in the postwar period where, at one time, it was 63 percent, and now it is 63.8 percent. It is about technology; it is about globalization, for sure; but it is also about skill set. Eighteen thousand precision manufacturing jobs in New England go unanswered, the smallest geographic region of the country. The Department of Labor reported this week that 6 million jobs in America go unanswered. It is part of a skill set issue. You know what else we need to be concerned about? Two million people in America are addicted to opioids. That is what we should be concerned about as well as getting them back into the workplace through the trampoline effect, where they hit it and bounce back up into the mainstream. But that is not what we did. Without any hearings, without any chance for the minority to participate, in terms of substance, we moved forward. I want to say to the last two speakers, they are sincere enough. We have heard now four different people come to the well of this House on the other side and say to the chairperson of our committee and a friend: Are you going to fix this after the bill leaves here? Four different people asked for a fix. I want to tell you, based on long experience in this House, the path gets more narrow as it leaves this House. It doesn’t grow more expansive. It will be harder to fix these things because of the budget score that was embraced. In 2001, we were promised widespread economic growth when President Bush took the Clinton surplus and offered $1.3 trillion worth of tax cuts. When you look at the distribution tables, they were right about one thing: everybody did get a tax cut. But then you look at those tables and you say: Let me examine who got what. In 2003, we came back and the President proposed $1 trillion worth of tax cuts based on the premise of economic growth, which didn’t happen. 
By the way, in 2004, there was repatriation, which may be the granddaddy of them all. Well, we are going to repatriate those holdings offshore at 5
1⁄4 percent on the premise of job growth. And there was none. We had this opportunity to do this together, as I described with worker participation rates, understanding that most families now are not having large numbers of children any longer. This should have been about immigration reform attached to it as well. We all know skilled workers from overseas are going to be an important part of the American economy, and we should be embracing that, along with sensible tax policies based upon some relief for the middle class. Instead, we are taking away the ability of American students to deduct interest on their loans to pay for a tax cut for people at the top? We are taking away a medical expense deduction for people who have Alzheimer’s disease to pay for the tax cut for people at the top? We are assessing universities and colleges a new, special tax to pay for tax cuts for people at the top? We could have had this conversation. We acknowledge what President Reagan and Speaker O’Neill did because it was based upon good will and commonality and not needing just a political victory. Day after day they plowed through with 450 witnesses in front of the Ways and Means Committee. How many witnesses did we have in front of the Ways and Means Committee? Zero. How many hearings did we have on this tax bill? Zero. We saw the manager’s amendment and were given 20 minutes to review it. I don’t mean 25 minutes. I mean 20 minutes. Back to regular order. We should scrap this bill. To those who are vulnerable on the other side, I would not be trusting of the idea that these issues are going to be fixed after you cast this vote tomorrow morning. There will be an opportunity to go back and redo this if the other side would say: Let’s find a meaningful path to cooperation between the two parties. That is all we are asking for on this side: include us in this discussion so we might invest in community colleges, vocational education, internship programs, skill set training, and answer the call of globalization. We still have innovation and creativity that far surpasses the rest of the world. There is nothing we can’t answer in America without those healthy investments that we need. Instead, when you look at these distribution tables that are proposed as to who is going to get what; taking away the alternative minimum tax for the 4.5 million families that pay it; asking students to give up their student interest deduction; the estate tax, which we are repealing; and we are asking that loved ones who have Alzheimer’s and being cared for at home to give up that medical deduction to pay for all of that, it makes no sense whatsoever. But there is an opportunity, Madam Speaker, to reverse course. In my years here, I can tell you this: Anybody who thinks that the United States Senate is going to accommodate their wishes, when they see the goalpost and the goal line of a handful of Members of this House, they are making a miscalculation. We have heard tonight they are going to do something about state and local tax deduction, they are going to do something about the historic tax credit, and they are going to revisit these issues. Do you know how difficult that is going to be, Madam Speaker? That is going to be nearly impossible. On top of that, they are going to go back and try to appeal the Affordable Care Act again and take 13 million people away from their insurance so that we can have a tax cut that further concentrates wealth for a handful of people in America? This is the House of Representatives, Madam Speaker, not the House of Lords. We don’t serve here by peerage. We are not entitled to anything here. Most of us come from pretty modest backgrounds. That is the principle we should be honoring in this tax debate as we discuss who is about to pay what and what the rewards ought to be for the hardworking men and women. This is last note I am going to express before I yield back my time. What about those 1 million veterans who have served us honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan? New veterans, what about them? Are we going to eventually cut their benefits with Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and put it all on the chopping block as we attempt to further concentrate wealth in America, particularly for unearned income, by the way? That is where we are heading. We should honor the skills of those men and women who get up every day and strive and work hard in this country with a sense of purpose and great patriotism. That is what we should be acknowledging in this debate. I am looking forward to tomorrow morning, when we conclude this debate and spend the 2 hours discussing more of what we have witnessed here tonight. There will be more than enough enthusiasm on our side. They will be lined up to RFK Stadium to participate tomorrow morning in this debate. That is how important this is to the future of the American people. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, Washington is just hilarious. Lawmakers back home tell everyone they are for tax reform, until it comes actually time to do it. Everyone says they want a fairer, flatter, simpler Tax Code, as long as you keep every special interest provision in this big, fat, messedup Tax Code. Everyone says they want to give people back more of what they earned and get Main Street businesses going, as long as you don’t change anything in the Tax Code. As long as the lobbyists win and the American people lose, they are willing to talk about it. House Republicans are actually acting on tax reform for the first time in 31 years. In Washington, they sneer at that family of four back home making $59,000 a year. That is the average household. Under our tax reform, they pay $1,182 less that they keep in their pocket. Washington makes fun of that. That is real money for families. A firefighter making $48,000 a year keeps over $1,300. That single mom working hard every day making $30,000 a year has a $700 larger refund than she gets today. That Main Street startup business working I don’t know how many hours, making $62,000 a year—that was my Chamber of Commerce member right there—in that startup business, they keep $3,007 more than they do today. Washington just laughs at that. But it is real money for real people. In my district, a family of four making $90,000—two teachers—keeps $2,176 more every year of their life from this. My friends on the Democrat side now worry about the debt. I remember the first year Democrats took control of the House, they doubled the deficit. The second year, they tripled it. The third year, it went to $1 trillion. It stayed that way until the American people gave the House back to Republicans. They love spending money and raising the deficit when they let Washington grow, but when it is time to grow jobs and paychecks, all of a sudden they are worried about the debt. The truth of the matter is we want to keep this debt and deficits going. Don’t change anything. Keep this slow growth economy, keep spending, and I guarantee you debts and deficits will grow. We are talking about growing jobs, growing paychecks, and getting back to a balanced budget by getting this economy moving in a big way. At the end of the day, it is time to end the status quo in Washington, D.C. Americans deserve a fair, flatter Tax Code, one that closes loopholes and ends special interest deductions so that Americans can keep more of what they earn, so their paychecks can raise and our businesses can compete and win anywhere in the world, especially here at home America. It is time our jobs start coming back to America, rather than watching them go: our jobs, research, manufacturing patents, our headquarters. That era is over, and it starts with H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
We will continue this debate tomorrow, Madam Speaker, so we will continue to deliver tax reform and tax cuts for the American people. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration of H.R. 1 is postponed. 
b1915 HISTORIC TAX REFORM FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot in this debate today. One thing is abundantly clear. Virtually every hardworking citizen in this country recognizes our genuine need for tax reform. Let me summarize some of the facts that have been presented today. The burdensome 70,000page U.S. Tax Code has grown to be unreasonably complex, increasingly unfair, and filled with special interest loopholes. American companies are taxed at the highest rate in the industrialized world, and the government takes even more from our smallbusiness owners and our entrepreneurs. As a result, our economic growth is stagnant, companies have gradually shifted their manufacturing and operations overseas, and families are struggling just to keep up. Today, the hurdles in our system seem almost insurmountable for hardworking people as they are afforded fewer and fewer opportunities for economic mobility. For previous generations, it was a different deal. We had the American Dream. The American Dream was defined by a simple promise: if you were willing to work hard and sacrifice and play by the rules, you could make a better life for yourself and your family. But today, our outdated Tax Code has pushed that dream beyond the grasp of more and more people. The good news is we can fix this problem, and we are going to do that in this Chamber tomorrow. For the first time in over 30 years, Congress has a historic opportunity to pass landmark tax reform that will be a turboboost to this economy, and it is going to lead us to a fairer system, as we said so many times, with more jobs and bigger paychecks for everyone. Our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1, will deliver significant tax reductions for low and middleincome earners, and it will help Americans in every level of our economy. The bill, which draws from 6 years of intensive work and expert analysis from more than 40 different congressional hearings, lowers individual income taxes by consolidating the existing seven brackets into four and doubling the standard deduction for everyone. It also establishes a new family tax credit. It provides higher education benefits. It repeals the death tax. It preserves deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations and property taxes, and it incentivizes saving for retirement. Tax returns will become incredibly simple for the first time in my lifetime because 9 out of 10 Americans will be able to complete their annual filing on a form the size of a postcard. The bill’s business tax reforms are equally seismic because we are going to slash our draconian corporate tax from 35 percent, the highest in the world, to 20 percent, and we are going to institute the lowest rates for small business job creators since World War II. U.S. companies will finally be allowed to compete again on a level playing field and bring their jobs and operations back home from overseas. The independent Tax Foundation estimated that our plan will result in the creation of approximately 975,000 full time American jobs and an increase in family incomes of 4.4 percent, on average. In Louisiana, for example, that would mean 13,293 new jobs and $1,857 of additional aftertax income for our average middle class families. The American people have long deserved a simpler, fairer, and effective system that rewards hard work and allows taxpayers to keep and invest more of what they earn. Our plan will finally provide that relief and spark the dramatic economic growth our Nation has so desperately needed. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is about more than just smart legislation. It is about a revival of that American Dream I referenced. That has one agenda that should unite every single one of us, and we hope all of our colleagues will support this historic landmark piece of legislation tomorrow. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD), a great American smallbusiness owner himself. Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Louisiana, for yielding. Madam Speaker, as my colleagues in this body know very well, it has been many years since we have reformed our Tax Code. Over the last few decades, Congress has cut some taxes here and there, but we are overdue for meaningful tax reform. Hardworking taxpayers in North Carolina are right to ask why it has been so long since we have even reformed our Tax Code. The unfortunate truth is that, for many years, Congress has thrown up the white flag in defeat against K Street lobbyists, and they settled for preserving the status quo. However, tomorrow, we have a rare opportunity to finally deliver a tax bill that puts working families first. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would be the biggest overhaul to our Tax Code in 30 years. To quickly summarize, this bill would collapse our tax brackets from seven to four; it would double the standard deduction and get rid of many lobbyist loopholes; and it would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, which would allow America to compete and to win. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation found that, if we passed this bill into law, American workers would see a 3 percent increase in their wages, and our country would see nearly 1 million fulltime jobs created. Madam Speaker, yesterday, my office received a letter from a constituent of mine that said: ‘‘As a manufacturer and constituent, I urge you to support tax reform and legislation that will fix our Tax Code that has held manufacturers back for far too long.’’ This is just an example of the many letters I have received in favor of this reform effort. In addition to letters of support that I have received, studies show that, if we pass this bill, a typical household would see their taxes cut nearly $2,000. Let’s think for a second what this means. Instead of the IRS taking it, families could spend it on their children. They could put it in their savings, or they could pay off debts. I am supporting this bill so we no longer hold manufacturers back from success. I am supporting this bill because it would make life simpler and easier for job creators, savers, and hardworking families. Last week, in this body, I addressed the fact that there are certain provisions within this bill that my colleagues and I may differ on, and I noted that that is just always going to be the case, but I also suggested that we ask ourselves three questions. The first question was: Does this bill cut taxes for the vast majority of hardworking American families? The second was: Will it bring back jobs? And the third question was: Will this bill simplify the tax filing process for working families next year and in the years to come? Madam Speaker, the answer to all three of those questions was ‘‘yes.’’ I urge my colleagues to vote tomorrow in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Last year, President Trump promised to cut taxes for working families, and that is exactly what this bill will do. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ). Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend and distinguished colleague from the State of Louisiana 
for his strong leadership and for hosting us this evening, this Special Order, on such an important issue. Madam Speaker, tax reform in west Texas and in rural America is about giving our hardworking and middle class families a break in allowing them to keep more of their hardearned money. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, our plan would increase wages by over 3 percent, create roughly 1 million new jobs, and raise the aftertax income of the average middleincome family by nearly $2,600. It is about simplifying the Tax Code and reducing the burden on taxpayers so that they don’t have to spend a combined almost 9 billion hours and $100 billion just to prepare their taxes every year. Under our plan, 9 out of 10 Americans, as my colleague mentioned, will be able to file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. It is about getting off the backs of our job creators, which are our small businesses, and letting them create more jobs for their communities. Our plan would reduce the tax rate on our Main Street job creators to the lowest it has been since World War II. It is about making America competitive again by leveling the playing field for American producers and manufacturers. Our plan would lower the corporate tax rate and bring jobs back to America, and it would also boost the average American household income by $4,000 and, in some studies, as high as $9,000. It is about giving our family farmers and ranchers a reason to invest in new tractors and equipment, combines and cotton strippers, so they can do what they have been doing: be more productive even at feeding and clothing the American people. This plan allows our farmers and ranchers, as well as our small businesses, the ability to write off the full cost of new technology and equipment immediately, and it is about eliminating the duplicative, unfair, and un American death tax that prevents family farmers, ranchers, and smallbusiness owners from passing down their hardearned American Dream to the next generation after they paid taxes on it their entire lives. Today, more than 70 percent—listen to this—more than 70 percent of family businesses don’t make it to the second generation; 90 percent don’t survive to the third generation. That is unacceptable. Tomorrow, Madam Speaker, marks an historic moment, the likes of which we haven’t seen in over 30 years, to change the current economic trajectory of this country and restore freedom and opportunity for all hardworking American families. Let’s seize it. Let’s deliver on our promise, and let’s give muchdeserved relief to the American people and a muchneeded boost to the American economy. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, who is always eloquent. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ). Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, it has been more than 30 years since Congress passed meaningful tax reform. In those three decades, we have seen unbelievable progress in technology, communications, manufacturing, and so much more. I am thrilled we now have a chance to pass meaningful tax reform, an opportunity to finally move to a Tax Code that works for families, small businesses, and Americans across the board. We have a onceinageneration chance to bolster middle class prosperity, strengthen our economy, and help America’s global competitiveness. These are not just abstract concepts. These are real people, families, businesses, and workers. Over this past year, I have traveled through the 35 counties that I represent, and I have been so impressed by the countless Kentuckians who are working to bring jobs of the future into rural America. Unlike these innovative entrepreneurs, our Tax Code is, unfortunately, stuck in the past. Like many of my constituents in the First District, I run a family farm and have experienced the challenges of dealing with an outdated and cumbersome Tax Code. I know firsthand the difficulties small businesses face when they try to operate, grow, and hire more workers while battling a Tax Code that does not work for them. Passing tax reform is finally within reach, and I enthusiastically support swift passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Throughout our Nation’s history, small businesses have served as the backbone of our communities. These companies provide highquality jobs, contribute to their local communities, and invest money right here at home. That is why I am dedicated to enacting tax relief that allows American small business owners to keep more of their hardearned tax dollars, to grow their businesses, and to compete globally. This bill will create almost 13,000 new jobs in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and will raise aftertax income for middle class families by almost $2,000. More than 59,000 taxpayers in the First District itemize their taxes, and because of the near doubling of the standard deduction and other simplifications, many of our taxpayers will have much simpler returns. And for our Nation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will generate economic growth adequate to increase Federal tax receipts by $1 trillion. In the First District of Kentucky, there are nearly 44,000 taxpayers who earn small business income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, smallbusiness owners will benefit from the new lower 9 percent tax rate on the first $75,000 of their business income for owners earning less than $150,000. Families and small businesses will have more opportunities to succeed with this framework. b1930 Additionally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces the number of deductions and credits aimed at special interests and other wellconnected groups, which will create a simpler, more level playing field for American taxpayers. Getting rid of these special privileges in the Tax Code will ensure that all Americans, not just those who can afford their own tax preparers, get to keep more of their own money. President Trump, my colleagues in Congress and I have promised to deliver tax reform in a big way. I am proud to be keeping this promise now. My constituents deserve a system that enables them to keep more of their hardearned money and spend less of their time dealing with our overly complicated Tax Code. I think it is important to address a concern that I have heard throughout the tax reform debate, one that I take very seriously: our national debt, which currently tops $20 trillion and is growing every day. The debt is a serious problem that poses an impediment to growth, a burden on our future, and a threat to our national security. While I am glad to finally hear bipartisan interest in addressing this challenge and getting the deficit under control, I think it is clear that any solution must include reducing government spending, particularly on mandatory programs that are the major drivers of our debt. I look forward to continuing to work towards this goal. The last time we addressed our Tax Code was when President Reagan was in office. Sticking with the Tax Code we have had for decades, one that leaves U.S. businesses and workers behind, is not an option. Now, I have high hopes for the future with this tax reform framework. I will continue fighting for reform that will benefit Kentuckians and our Nation as a whole, and I look forward to supporting progrowth solutions that have proven to benefit our Nation and our citizens. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, there is a trend here tonight. Those who are addressing the House this evening have had their own experience with this burdensome Tax Code. They have been smallbusiness owners, entrepreneurs, job creators, and farmers, like my friend from Kentucky. I appreciate their zeal for this issue. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ), a former prosecutor, an Army veteran, and always a good voice to reason. Mr. GARRETT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for yielding. Madam Speaker, the last time this Nation passed major tax reform, yours truly weighed 112 pounds at the beginning of wrestling season. I had a full head of hair, I never set foot west of Mississippi, nor outside the United States of America. Madam Speaker, the last time this country addressed tax reform, the Soviet Union was welcoming a new leader 
named Mikhail Gorbachev. It has been too long. It is an honor to represent the Fifth District of Virginia because I think it is historically unique. I have spoken from this podium and this floor about the amazing characteristics of that particular historical region. Among the great individuals from the Fifth District of Virginia was a flawed man, an imperfect man, a slaveowner named Jefferson, who gave us a nearperfect document, named the ‘‘Declaration of Independence.’’ While not perfect, Jefferson had perfect insight, and, perhaps, you could argue he was prescient when it is said that he said: ‘‘I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.’’ It has been enlightening tonight to stand on this floor. If you are watching at home, I suppose that you can turn the volume down on C–SPAN, because I don’t intend to yell, as so many others have before me. And I will tell you that it is funny to listen to my colleagues across the aisle who say: This is a 429 page bill. I would point out that saying the number of pages doesn’t actually make the bill longer and that the Affordable Care Act, that they had us pass, so that we could find out what was in it, was 2,300 pages with over 20,000 pages of regulation. So there is a little disingenuity, at the very least, for them to lament the first real overhaul in our draconian tax structure in nearly two generations by suggesting that 429 pages is a long document, when such a hearty and robust undertaking is afoot. Madam Speaker, I would submit that the government needs the people and not the other way around. That is what makes us the United States of America. It is a clever ploy to attack the rich and the job creators, but let me point out the fact that 97.3 percent of taxes are paid by the top 50 percent of wage earners. So, therefore, when you attempt to cut taxes for working class people, someone who is in the 51st percentile will, indeed, receive a tax cut, but they are, by no means, rich. It is a clever ploy to attack corporations, because corporations don’t have faces, but people do. And who do corporations provide jobs for? People. President Obama acknowledged that our corporate tax structure was among the most backward in the world, and it needed to be addressed, but he didn’t address it. President Obama acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act had ‘‘real problems,’’ but no one on the other side of the aisle will address them. So, too, did President Clinton. That is two Presidents from the other side of the aisle in a row, but no one will address them. Instead, we will create fear and demagoguery and attack faceless corporations, because faceless corporations don’t have faces, but people do. We need to stop destroying jobs and opportunity and prosperity through the demagoguery of class warfare, attacking corporations, without acknowledging that the very people who benefit from their existence are the people who have the opportunity to send their children to college, to make memories on a vacation, to pursue and achieve dreams, to marry the love of their life with the very incomes achieved by these corporations. Now, let’s talk a little bit about corporations, because I know something about corporations, and we know something about corporations in Virginia’s Fifth District. Dan River Mills stood in Danville, Virginia—a company started in 1881. It closed its doors in 2006. In 2008, the smokestacks from Dan River Mills that had been a symbol not only of the skyline of that once thriving town, but also an identifying factor in the landscape of the city, were torn down as jobs went away. Another corporation, Burlington Industries, Klopman Mills, in Pittsylvania County, hurt Virginia, and prospered from 1940 through 2007. When they left, over 1,000 jobs went with them as well. And the real estate for the property that once employed generation after generation, sending innumerable children to college, and fulfilling the humble dreams of working class Virginians, sold for a paltry $750,000. VaughanBassett Furniture—and I would commend to anyone watching at home, the book ‘‘Factory Man,’’ by Beth Macy, which chronicles John Bassett, III’s struggle to keep 700 furniture jobs in this country, in my district— that corporation changed people’s lives and gave them jobs. Lane Manufacturing, for generations it was a tradition—in my part of the world, at least—that a young woman, prior to being married, might receive a Lane cedar chest—a hope chest. In fact, no less an iconoclast than Shirley Temple was used to peddle Lane cedar chests as something that would be an aspirational goal for a young, working class woman, as she set forth on pursuing the dreams of her life. From 1902, until just about 15 or 20 years ago, hundreds and hundreds of jobs, in Alta Vista, Campbell County, Virginia, left. Broyhill. So many companies—some still around—all shadows of their former selves, as corporate money and jobs went offshore. And why? Because we have incentivized the departure of the very means by which our families have prospered and done so in order to vilify an entity incapable of defending itself, while neglecting to understand that the beneficiaries of the opportunity created thereby were their very neighbors and those who, in their demagoguery, they said they worked to protect. Last year, in Danville, Virginia, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, who is still there—God bless them—had a cookout for the employees of Goodyear Tire, and the family members, thereof, and anybody who had ever worked for Goodyear Tire. They thought maybe there would be 800 or 1,000 people who attended this cookout. By the time it was over with, you couldn’t get a pack of hotdog buns from a Food Lion within 30 miles, because that 1,000 people became 2,000 people, and became 3,000 people, and became nearly 4,000 people. These people didn’t come to eat a hotdog with Goodyear Tire. They came to eat a hotdog with their family, their friends, and their community. I stood last week at Piedmont Precision Machine Company, in Danville Pittsylvania. I looked at $1.6 million worth of new equipment that allowed this American small business to continue to compete with competitors abroad. And the rich man, who owned the company, said: TOM, I am going to have to take a loan to pay my taxes. But if you pass this bill, we will make some money, I will get more equipment, and we are going to hire some more people. So understand that people don’t come to eat hot dogs with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, they come to eat hot dogs with their family members, their community, and people who have seen generation after generation receive opportunity, by virtue of their hard work, and opportunity provided by the very entities vilified by our opponents, without acknowledging the beneficiaries of the opportunity they provide are the very ones they purport to protect. So Piedmont Precision Machine Company toils on. We work to attract more employers in Danville and Pittsylvania, and Henry County, and Martinsville area. Maybe Kyocera is going to come. We hope so. We think that if we get those jobs, we think that we might be able to move manufacturing jobs in hightech to southside Virginia from Northern Virginia and California. But what I am hearing from the job creators is they want to see this thing get done. And when those jobs come from California, Northern Virginia, China, and India to Campbell County, Bedford County, Lunenburg County, and Mecklenburg County, it will be because we acted in a brave, bold manner, despite the divisive rhetoric that denies the reality that people benefit from opportunity, and opportunity is best provided, not by the government, but by people of initiative. Now, I have heard so much rhetoric about what you oppose if you support this tax bill, so let’s see if we can’t flip that shoe onto the other foot. If you oppose this bill, you oppose lowering rates for working and middleincome families, while retaining the highest rate. That doesn’t sound like a tax cut for the rich to me. If you oppose this bill, you literally oppose doubling nearly the standard 
deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for an individual filer; and you oppose, if you oppose this bill, doubling the standard deduction from $12,700 to $24,000 for a married couple. Why would people oppose that? Do they think the government can make better decisions with the money they earn than they can? If you oppose this bill, then you oppose simplifying the Tax Code by eliminating years of carveout deductions made for special interests. Quite literally, a convoluted Tax Code benefits who? Tax attorneys and accountants. I suppose that the other side of the Chamber is the party that has a vested interest in keeping tax attorneys and accountants at work. I want to see people in Mecklenburg County at work. If you oppose this bill, you oppose establishing a family tax credit; you oppose raising the child credit by $600 per child; and you oppose establishing a new credit of $300 per family member so that you might be able to help your mom, dad, aunt, uncle, or a disabled relative, who you choose to help in your home. Why would people oppose that? If you oppose this bill, you oppose reducing small business taxes to the lowest rate since the Second World War. If you oppose this bill, you oppose establishing a super low nonpercent rate for small startup businesses making less than $75,000 a year in income. Why would you oppose startups? If you oppose this bill, you oppose removing incentives that drive businesses to take money and jobs overseas. Don’t talk to me about that. We know something about that in Virginia’s Fifth. So, finally, let me submit this: for the folks at home, who are smart enough to figure this out on their own, if you pay $100 more because a deduction is eliminated and your taxes are cut by $1,000 or more, as would be the case for a family of four making $58,000 a year, that is not a tax increase. b1945 I have never, to my knowledge, other than the United States Army, worked for anything resembling a corporate entity in my life, but I know a lot of human beings who have, and I have seen what happens when we, through our divisive rhetoric, drive them away. This isn’t about corporations. This isn’t about the rich. This is about human beings. I think it was succinctly summarized, if perhaps by accident, by my colleague in the other Chamber, Senator SCHUMER , who said: 
It is our research that indicates that if you pass this, some people’s taxes might go up by 2023. 
Think hard. What that acknowledges is that between now and then, people’s taxes go down. While Mr. Jefferson also said that: 
The fruits of the working class are safest when the assembly is not in session. I would submit that if indeed these problems exist, they should work with us to improve our Tax Code, which hasn’t been touched since I literally weighed 112 pounds and had a full head of hair, and to start being part of the solution and stop being part of the problem. Again, the government depends upon Americans, not Americans upon the government. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, we have heard some compelling arguments here on the floor in the last few hours and some important facts have been shared. I appreciate so much the eloquent words of my colleagues from Texas and Kentucky and Virginia and Pennsylvania and Florida and all over this great land of ours who have shared with us the importance of this landmark bill and this historic vote that we will take in this Chamber tomorrow. I just thought there were a few more facts that were important to summarize here at the end of our debate this evening. I wanted to quote the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because they looked at this bill and they gave an exhaustive review of this, as so many have. This is their summary: ‘‘The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a growth bill, achieving faster economic growth, encouraging job creation, and getting more money in Americans’ pockets each year.’’ I think that is a pretty good summary of what the bill will do and what it will accomplish. We brought just a couple of graphics here to illustrate the national impact of this landmark reform. When we pass this bill and we get this to the President’s desk, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will lead to the creation of an additional 975,000 new fulltime jobs across this country. It will raise aftertax income for middle class families by $2,598 each. That is an increase of 4.4 percent. That is real money to families who are struggling to make ends meet around this country. It will generate economic growth sufficient to increase Federal tax receipts by $1 trillion. That is real money. That is a real boost to the American economy. I brought another graphic here to show what this will mean in my district, by way of example, in Louisiana. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will mean a whole lot for my State. It will lead to the creation of an additional 13,293 jobs in my State of Louisiana alone. Those are goodpaying, fulltime jobs. It will raise aftertax income for middle class families in Louisiana by $1,857. That is real money. That will mean a lot to the families in my State. More specifically, let me talk about the Fourth Congressional District in northwest and west Louisiana, 15 parishes, about onethird of our State by land area; good, hardworking, God fearing Americans. Let me tell you what it will mean to the people of Louisiana’s Fourth Congressional District. Here are just four highlights. It will be a larger child tax credit. In my district, there are 53,918 taxpayers who claim the child tax credit every year. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase the child tax credit from $1,000 per child to $1,600 per child for each of those families. Let me give you another one: the tax relief for small businesses. This is a big thing in my district. 49,929 taxpayers in the Fourth Congressional District of Louisiana have small business income, and that is a business that a taxpayer operates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces taxes for smallbusiness owners. First, the bill implements a new, lower 9 percent tax rate on the first $75,000 of net business income for active smallbusiness owners earning less than $150,000 through their businesses. That is a whole lot of people, a whole lot of LLCs and small companies in my district. Second, the bill lowers taxes on small business investment by creating a new 25 percent small business tax rate. That is capped at 25 percent. That is a big deal to people who are struggling to make ends meet. Number three, a third feature, the elimination of the alternative minimum tax, the AMT. 4,049 taxpayers in the Fourth Congressional District of Louisiana are impacted directly by the AMT. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminates that factor. Another one is simpler taxes. Listen to this number: 67,543 taxpayers in the Fourth Congressional District, in my district back home in Louisiana, itemize their taxes. As a result of the near doubling of the standard deduction and other simplifications, many taxpayers will have much simpler returns. It is estimated, as we have said so many times tonight, that nine out of ten Americans will be able to file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard. That is a big change and a great simplification for the people of my district. We owe this to them. I wanted to share a few other facts that I think are important to highlight tonight, Mr. Speaker. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is more than just a win for our American economy. It is a win for our American values. Let me give you a couple examples of that. First, it is a win for free speech. The bill incorporates the language of our Free Speech and Fairness Act, which we filed as a standalone piece of legislation earlier this year in February. That will stop the IRS from policing the speech of churches and charitable organizations. That is a huge relief for men and women of faith, in particular, who watched the IRS breathe down the necks of nonprofits and religious entities, threatening to take away their taxexempt status if they dare talk 
about the moral and social and political issues of the day. That is a big win for free speech and a big win for them. This bill is also a big win for American families. Let me give you a few examples of important features of how this helps the family in this country. The adoption tax credit has been restored. This is section 1102 of the bill. Now, this is a critically important thing to advance the policy, to advance and encourage and incentivize adoption in this country. This is something that all of us should agree on. Over 60 percent of adopted children are adopted by middle and lowincome taxpayers in this country. Almost half of the children adopted from foster care live in families with household incomes at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Listen to this statistic: a study reported by the Federal Children’s Bureau showed that the government saves between $65,000 and $127,000 for each child who is adopted rather than placed in longterm foster care. Studies comparing children who remain in foster care to children who are adopted show that adopted children are 54 percent less likely to be delinquent or arrested, 19 percent less likely to become teen parents, and 76 percent more likely to be employed. Can we all agree that the adoption tax credit being restored is an important part of this bill? I think we can. Here is another way it helps families, Mr. Speaker: the family tax credits. This is something that everybody back home should pay attention to. The child tax credit, section 1202 of the bill, this increases the child tax credit, as I mentioned a moment ago, from $1,000 per child to $1,600 per child. It provides a credit of $300 for each parent and nonchild dependent to help all families with their everyday expenses. The child dependent care tax credit helps families care for their children and other dependents, such as a disabled grandparent who may need additional support. Here is another feature: unborn children are recognized in the 529 education savings account provisions of the Tax Code. Our tax reform bill allows a 529 education savings account to be opened, for the first time, for an unborn child or a child in utero. We recognize the humanity and the sanctity of life of the unborn child. Here is another feature: the marriage penalties are finally removed. For too long, we have effectively penalized married couples in this country simply for being married. Our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changes that. In most cases, married couples will no longer be penalized just for their choice to be married. Mr. Speaker, I will close with just a few more remarks. A lot has been said here tonight, more will be said in the morning preceding our vote, but this is a big day for Congress and a big day for the country. It has been over 30 years since we last updated our tax system. For reference, I was in the eighth grade the last time tax reform was accomplished in this Chamber. Many of those entering the workforce weren’t even born yet the last time Congress fulfilled this responsibility. Today, Americans are struggling to make ends meet, to find decentpaying jobs, and to prepare for retirement. We must do right by our children and our grandchildren and give them a better future than our own. Fortunately, my Republican colleagues and I have put forth a framework to do just that. We have discussed for the last few hours in this Chamber as we have been talking that our plan will create more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks for working class Americans and small businesses. When businessowners are able to keep more of their profits, they will invest that money in their companies and in their employees, and that will spur economic growth, because they will expand their facilities, they will create and expand new product lines, they will add more jobs, and that is good for all of us. Passing meaningful tax reform isn’t about sticker shock talking points that we have heard so much about. It is about real everyday Americans who want to grow their businesses, offer better wages to their employees, provide for their families, but who have struggled to do so because of our oppressive and outdated tax policy. Our plan puts Americans first and it offers real relief to those who need it most. The Federal Tax Code today is more than 70,000 pages long. For context, that is more than 60 times longer than the King James Bible, and it contains none of the Good News. It is time to simplify this Code and it is time to unleash the free market in our American economy again. We have that chance. This will be the biggest Christmas gift to the American people in over 3 decades. It is truly historic and it is long overdue. Mr. Speaker, we urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on this floor tomorrow. Let’s make history together. Let’s do right by the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
CONSEQUENCES OF PASSING THE REPUBLICANS’ TAX PLAN The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COMER ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we are going to be asked to cast perhaps one of the most important votes that will take place in a career here in the House based on the tax plan that the Republicans have put forward. I say history is important, because this vote is likely to have consequences for years and years and years to come. As I noted earlier tonight, as we look at a million new veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who deserve our care, for those of us who represent soldiers’ homes and hospitals for the VA, we know just how important this is. We know what happens to Alzheimer’s patients who are going to lose the deduction on healthcare. We know what is going to happen to those students who currently write off parts of their student loans through interest deductions. We know the assessed tax that is going to go on places like the University of Notre Dame and others. We also understand that the homeowner deduction, the mortgage interest deduction, which is a huge middle class benefit, is about to be taken away arbitrarily. State and local taxes, in some cases sales taxes, are about to be abolished all based upon the premise of maybe there will be enough economic growth. There is no evidence, based on the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 or the repatriation that took place in 2004, that any of this is accurate, but they continue to proceed. The next part of the challenge is they have now substituted the old supply side economics theory—remember tax cuts pay for themselves—and they have come up with a new term, and the new term that they have come up with is ‘‘dynamic scoring.’’ So we have the challenge of technology, we have the challenge of globalization, and, yes, we have the challenge of skill set across America to move people into a direction of employment where they and their skills might be aligned with the jobs that are open, because the Department of Labor this week said there are 6 million jobs in America that go unanswered, 18,000 precision manufacturing jobs in New England that go unanswered, and 1 million tech jobs. b2000 So we should be using this opportunity to invest in vocational education; we should be using it to invest in internship programs; and, yes, we should be using it to invest in community colleges. So part of this discussion should be based on, again, the historic vote of longterm investment. Now, we also know that is unlikely to happen because, when people have a chance to look at these distribution tables on these tax cuts as to who gets what, they are going to be furious. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Napa, California (Mr. THOMPSON ), and then the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LARSON ) will be acknowledged right after that. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. It is not often that I come down and participate in these Special Orders, but 
I have got to tell you I was in my office watching the previous speakers, and I started to get a little queasy from the spin that they were providing from the floor, talking about what they say this bill will do. I can tell you that there were a lot of inaccuracies in some of the things that they were trying to convince the American people that they would benefit from this. As Mr. NEALsaid, this bill, this vote, is an important vote. This is going to be around a long time. Numerous speakers today have mentioned the fact that the last time we did major tax reform, a major tax overhaul, was over 30 years ago. So if that is any indication, we are going to be living with the consequences of this bill for a long time, and I don’t think those consequences are anything to be proud of. We heard repeatedly that this bill is not going to help at all the wealthiest people in the country, and you just can’t help but laugh. The last speaker came out and stated that this does away with the alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax was put in place to ensure that the wealthiest of taxpayers actually pay taxes because they were able to escape paying taxes, so that is why the alternative minimum tax came into play. They are the ones who pay this tax, so if you do away with it, I don’t see how you can, with a straight face, say that this doesn’t help wealthy Americans. Inheritance tax was talked about a lot. As a matter of fact, it was a very dishonest discussion. They kept referring to it as the ‘‘death tax.’’ We have heard this ad nauseam. We heard it in committee. We hear it on the floor. We have heard it for the past few years. This has been a very clever campaign on the other side’s part to discredit the inheritance tax. If you open the Code, the Tax Code, there is nothing in the Code that says the death tax. It doesn’t exist. It is not real. It is made up. It is fiction. We heard some very compelling arguments about how farmers will lose their farms if they don’t do away with the death tax. There is no such thing as a death tax. We heard repeatedly that, after somebody dies, it is unfair to make them pay taxes. I am here to tell you, after you die, you will never have to pay taxes. The inheritance tax refers to inherited wealth. If I inherit money from my parents, then I am taxed on that wealth that I inherit. And there is a provision in the law that says the first $11 million doesn’t get touched, so it has got to be a pretty huge estate before you even pay any taxes on it. If there was all this concern about losing the family farm, then the Republicans should have taken up my bill, a bill that I have had for a number of years with absolutely no support from the Republican side of the aisle, that says, if you inherit the family farm or a family business and you continue to farm it or you continue to run the business, you are deferred from paying any inheritance tax. Now, if you inherit it and sell it and take the money and move to a beach in Hawaii, then you would pay a tax on that inherited wealth. So this is subterfuge, at best. It is dishonesty, at worst. The last speaker said that American families are big winners in this bill. Well, I don’t know whose American family he was talking about. Mr. NEAL was right when he said American families had a chance to be big winners if we had used this opportunity to invest in workers, invest in training, invest in community colleges, create jobs, create opportunities, build this tax reform from the middle class, the working class out. But, instead, we didn’t do that. We didn’t even talk about it. We didn’t talk about it because we didn’t have a single hearing on one of the most important bills that we will cast a vote on in our time in Congress. We didn’t hear from one expert witness. They dropped this bill, written in secret. As a matter of fact, many of our Republican colleagues were complaining that they didn’t get a chance to see what was in the bill. They dropped this on us at the last minute. We could have worked with them. We could have addressed some of these issues. We could have figured out how to invest in the American worker. We could have figured out how to make investments that created jobs. But, no, we didn’t get to do that because we didn’t have any hearings. It was written in the middle of the night, in a dark room someplace way out of our wheelhouse. They said they had to do this because the Tax Code was too big, and I agree with them. I think it is too big. I think it does need to be reformed. But the fact of the matter is, and Joint Tax testified on this, if their bill is passed and signed into law, it won’t do away with a single chapter of the Tax Code, but, instead, it will add one more to it. So this is literally making the Tax Code bigger. And I want to know who those American families are who some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim will be helped by this, because this is what I see in reading this and reading the analyses from different experts. If someone in your family has Alzheimer’s, you will pay more because they are going to take away the medical expense deduction that you now can take advantage of. Lowincome folks with kids, you are going to pay more when you are excluded from the child tax credit. If you are a teacher, dedicated to your students and to their wellbeing and you take money out of your own pocket to buy pencils, supplies, and things for your classroom, today you get a deduction for that because we know how important education is. But under this bill, you will pay more because they are taking that deduction away, too. We just heard from a veteran on the other side who said how great this is for veterans. Well, let me tell you, if you are a veteran and you get your duty station reassigned and you have to go someplace else and the house you have to sell in your first duty station, if you haven’t lived in it for 8 years, you are going to be taxed on any profit from that. So if you are a veteran and you get transferred, you are not going to benefit from this. You are going to lose. Do you have a student loan? And we all know how expensive those are these days. If you do, you are going to pay more because they are taking away your ability to deduct the interest payment on your student loan. Do you own a home? If you do, you will pay more when they limit the mortgage deduction, mortgage interest deduction. By the way, as we heard in committee during the markup on this bill, this could actually decrease the value of your home by 10 percent. Now, tell me how that helps working class, middle class families to say, all that money that you have been saving by buying your home, we are going to take 10 percent away from the value of that? That certainly doesn’t create a big win for American families. Are you in the middle class, that big win for American families, those middle class families? Because the analysis says that 36 million middle class families are going to see a tax hike in this bill. Do you deduct your State and local taxes? Well, if you do, you are going to pay more because you are going to lose that deduction, too. Do you care about infrastructure investments in your community? I had a visit yesterday from the head of the San Francisco airport. He came in because of this bill. I don’t represent San Francisco, but he came in to see me because I am a member of this committee, and he knew we were going to be taking this bill up. They have a tremendous amount of infrastructure investment pending. They do it with the bonds that will be disallowed under this bill, the same, similar type of action that they are going to do in regard to lowincome housing. In my State, we need housing badly, and we are able to build lowincome housing by using those bonds that are made available in our Tax Code. That goes away. That hurts homes. That hurts people who want to move into homes. And I will tell you, in my district, it is a particularly raw subject right now because in one of my counties, Sonoma County, we had a 2 percent vacancy rate in residential housing about a month ago. And about a month ago now, we had the worst fire in California history. In Sonoma County, it wiped 
out 5 percent of the residential housing stock. There were about 9,000 homes, total, in the fire that were destroyed, homes in Sonoma, homes in Napa, homes in Lake, homes in Mendocino, homes in Butte, homes down in southern California, and that just further deteriorated the housing shortage problem that we face. So to take away ability to construct new, lowincome housing hurts. But I think what hurt even more is, in this bill, they took away the ability for individuals and families, those middle class families that they are talking about helping, they took away their ability to write off their losses due to a disaster. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. NEAL. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. How did they do that? Mr. THOMPSON of California. I don’t know how they did that. I don’t know why they would do that. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Why would they do that? In the face of these fires and in the face of so many in California understanding that impact, why is it that they did this? Mr. THOMPSON of California. Well, that is—I wish I could say that is the $64 million question, but, sadly, it is going to cost taxpayers a lot more than $64 million when all is said and done. It is a mystery to me. I asked the chairman, who wrote the bill, during the committee markup, why he would do that, and he had no response. He said: Well, we are going to fix it. We are going to make it better. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Were there any hearings? Mr. THOMPSON of California. There were no hearings. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. So there have been no hearings. Mr. THOMPSON of California. No hearings, and they didn’t fix it. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. They didn’t fix it. And yet here we are, on the verge of voting on a bill that will impact 100 percent of the economy and 100 percent of the Tax Code. No hearings? Mr. THOMPSON of California. No hearings. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. NEAL, you suggested in the process, at the outset, that this was a missed opportunity, and then you went back and gave a historic tutorial on how we got here. How is it that we got here and arrived here with no public hearings and no expert testimony? Mr. NEAL. The summary of this tax bill was published last Thursday. We did a walkthrough on Monday. We only had a chance to respond to the bill, or the chairman’s mark on Friday. And then on Monday, we did a walk through. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday morning, we did the markup. Not one hearing. And recall that, in the last moments of the markup, we were handed a manager’s amendment. We had 20 minutes to react to the manager’s amendment, so no hearings. And compare that with 1986, which everybody heralds now, as the great moment of Reagan and O’Neill and Rostenkowski and Gephardt and Bradley, 450 witnesses, 30 public hearings. The Secretary of the Treasury sat through the markup. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. In your history of serving on this committee— and we are joined by Mr. LEVIN and Mr. KINDand Mr. W ELCH . And, Mr. LEVIN, I have to ask you this, too. In your serving on this committee, has there ever been a bill of this magnitude or proportion that has been brought out without a public hearing, without expert witnesses? Mr. THOMPSON had a raging fire in his district that we heard him, from his own lips, what it did and how it devastated Sonoma and Napa Valley, and no hearings. Is there a precedent for this? Mr. NEAL. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). b2015 Mr. LEVIN. I don’t think so. Mr. NEALhas spelled out, and you have, the atrocious approach here. So I think we can sum it up. The process has been terrible. The product is worse. That is what happens when you have a very terrible process, you get a frightfully bad product. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, Mr. KINDstood up earlier and talked about the fact that the other side, who claim to be deficit hawks, all of a sudden, they are an endangered species. I don’t know if the gentleman from Wisconsin wants to expand upon that and further ask the gentleman from California. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, let me just thank the gentleman for drawing attention to the terrible fires that did so much damage in my home State, and the fact that they took the deduction for these types of disasters away from the American people. But I don’t want anybody to think it is just about fires, nor is it just about my State. They took away this provision in the Tax Code for anybody who has a disaster from now on. If it is a mudslide, an earthquake, a fire, any disaster, you will not be able to claim that deduction. And to add insult to injury, the chairman grandfathered in the hurricane victims in his own district. I will just say one more thing. If this isn’t all bad enough, everybody should know that all of these costs that we have talked about are bad enough, but there is one cost in here that is crippling, and it is crippling to our children and our grandchildren, and that is the fact that this bill is not paid for, and it adds $2.3 trillion—that is trillion with a T—to our national debt, and that is going to be passed right along to our children, right along to our grandchildren, and that is going to hurt us in the years to come. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, could I just ask for the gentleman to clarify something? You said earlier that you came down here, and you rarely come down here. This is a Special Order. The reason that you are here, the reason that Mr. DAVIS is here, Mr. W ELCH , Mr. L EVIN, and reason that Mr. NEAL, Mr. K IND, and myself are all here is because we haven’t had the opportunity to have a hearing and have expert witnesses. Have you had any expert witness? Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, there have been no hearings on this bill, there have been no expert witnesses. The only help that we have gotten are from the outside organizations and the universities that crunched these numbers to be able to give us some glimpse of what is going to happen and the benefit of some analysis from the Joint Tax staff, but there have been no hearings, there have been no experts, nobody from our district who lives and breathes this, no one from our districts who are going to be impacted by this. This was done from the top down and crammed through in the most bastardized system that I have ever seen in my years here. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND). Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I think my good friend and colleague from California is raising a very important point, and it is a point that all of us here this evening on the Ways and Means Committee, with the leadership of Mr. NEALfrom Massachusetts, have been raising for some time. Doing tax reform right is tough. There are a lot of moving pieces to it, and there are a lot of traps and unintended consequences if you do it the wrong way. Not having one hearing, not having proper vetting, not taking the time to listen to people back home in our respective States and districts about the consequences of something that is going to affect every American life in this country is legislative malpractice, and that is what we are on the verge of committing leading up to tomorrow’s vote. My friend from California mentioned the $2.3 trillion in additional debt over the next 10 years by the time you add in the interest payments and how devastating that will be, and it is happening at the wrong time. I mean, we might have gotten away with that with the 1981 tax cuts that weren’t paid for back then because there was a little bit of time to recover 
from a big fiscal mistake, and from 2001, 2003. We have run out of time as a nation, with 70 million baby boomers beginning their massive retirement, 10,000 a day joining Social Security and Medicare. But their entire theory is premised on the fact that over twothirds of the tax cut will be going to large corporations under their bill of this illusory growth that is going to come from it. Part of that is based on this tax holiday, they call it deemed repatriation, where these multinational companies are going to be able to bring dollars back into America at a much lower rate and supposedly reinvesting here that is going to promote growth. But there was a recent survey by Bank of America and Merrill Lynch of 300 executives of some of the largest U.S. multinational companies asking them what they would do with this deemed repatriated money coming back to the country. Their number one response was paying down debt. Reinvesting in their company, reinvesting in research and development, investing in more jobs and goodpaying jobs barely registered in that survey. But this should not come as a surprise. It is not like we haven’t been down this road before. We tried a repatriation bill back in the early 2000s, where these companies were able to bring back a ton of money, and what they used it for was dividend giveouts and stock buybacks. Yet they are refusing to learn the lessons of the past and going on this theory of an illusory growth that none of the major economists see under this tax bill, and it is a huge fiscal gamble that I think is going to leave us in the same place as the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which was one of the worst decades when it came to job growth in our country. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman. Mr. THOMPSON of California. The gentleman is absolutely correct. Thank you for pointing that out. Mr. NEAL. I yield to Mr. DAVIS to talk about historic tax credits. I know Mr. LIPINSKI is here from Chicago as well to talk about new markets, and then we can talk, as Mr. KINDdid, about the retirement crisis that is coming, and we can just yield back and forth to make sure that people understand the totality of what is being asked in this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. NEALfor not only yielding to me, but for the tremendous leadership that he has provided throughout this process. Mr. Speaker, as I listen, there is no doubt in my mind that the vote we will take tomorrow is going to be one of the most important votes that I will ever take as a Member of Congress. It is important because I know that it will affect, in one way or the other, every citizen of this country. As I listened to the debate over the last 2 days, I know that America is at a great crossroads, and that we can either go forward or we can go backwards. We can go forward into a new era of job creation, supporting education for all, and keeping the greatest level of healthcare that this country has ever known. Or we can go backwards, backwards with Marie Antoinettetype tax policy that takes opportunity and bread from the middle class, and then say: Let them eat cake. Or we can go forward with a more equitable tax plan, one that promotes infrastructure protection and development by keeping the provisions for State and local deductions, which everybody knows will create jobs, jobs, and jobs. We can go forward by making sure that the access we currently have to quality healthcare will continue. I hear many people talking about what we will get from H.R. 1, what I call the Republican Marie Antoinette tax bill. But let me just mention some of what we will not get that we already have. Teachers will not get the ability to write off the $250 that they spend out of their pockets for materials and supplies for their students. Students will lose $65 billion in Federal funds to help make college more affordable. Senior citizens, as we have already heard, with Alzheimer’s will lose the ability to write off high medical costs. Student loan interest can no longer be used. Cities like mine; like Philadelphia; like Detroit; like Gary, Indiana; cities all over the country will not be able to make use of the new market tax credits to rebuild slum and blighted areas. Many of those areas have been laying fallow for 50 and 60 years, where there used to be thriving communities. Historical buildings will be left standing because the tax credits to restore them will no longer be available, losing the opportunity to create jobs and work opportunities for people who are unemployed. Under the bill, any way that you cut it, the middle class will lose and the special interests and the wealthy will again win. I know that we are again being sold the idea of what I call trickledown economics. Feed those at the top, and crumbs will trickle down to all the rest of society, even though study after study has shown that this does not work. It is nothing more than a theory, far from any basis of truth. I think that we have no choice. When I hear these kinds of discussions, I think of all kinds of things. But I guess what I think most is something that Billie Holiday wrote and sang. She said: ‘‘Momma may have, papa may have, but God bless the child that has got his own.’’ And she said: ‘‘Rich relations give crusts of bread and such. You can help yourself, but don’t take too much.’’ So if you are waiting for something to trickle down, you better remember what she said: ‘‘ . . . God bless the child that has got his own.’’ One thing that each one of us has is the ability to vote, and I will vote tomorrow. And I will make sure that when I vote, I will vote to represent the thousands and thousands of middle class families who need to have hope, who need to have faith, and who need to believe that when we sing the song ‘‘My Country, ‘Tis of Thee,’’ that we are singing about them, too. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. NEAL for yielding. Mr. NEAL. I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND). Mr. KIND. I appreciate the remarks of my friend from Chicago. He represents a large urban district. I represent a large rural district in Wisconsin. He may be a Bears fan, and I might be a Packers fan, but one thing we agree on is this a bill of goods for both of our constituencies. I am especially concerned about the economic impact in the large rural congressional district that I represent where production agriculture is still an important part of our economy. Some of the changes that they are making are going to be devastating to family farmers. They are taking away the 199 tax deduction, which is as important for our domestic manufacturers as it is for our family farmers. If you want to grow things and invent things and create things, make things in America, the 199 has a proven track record of making it easier for our farmers and manufacturers to do it. Under their bill, that goes away. That operating loss carryback, which is important for a lot of farmers in order to recoup some of the losses that they have experienced in their business, it goes away. Likekind exchanges for property and heavy machinery in farm country goes away. A lot of my farmers are operating on a margin right now. I am concerned about the impact this is going to have on the rural economy and our family farmers with what they are proposing. You don’t have to be from a city or from a rural district to understand that, again, the work wasn’t put into this bill to understand the real consequences of what they are asking for. It is not too late. We can still regroup and work in the bipartisan fashion that tax reform was meant to occur and figure out a way to truly simplify, make us more competitive, but make it fair for working families, small businesses, and family farmers in all of our districts, rather than this rush to judgment just so they can score a political win before the end of the year. b2030 So I think the points that my friend from Chicago raised are very valid, and it is something that I would hope all of us would heed before we reach our final decision tomorrow morning. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the one thing that I like 
about the Packers is that the people own them. Mr. KIND. Amen. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, forgive me for being from New England. I will leave that alone. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LARSON ). Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this committee and also for the tutorial that he gave us earlier today about how we got to this spot. I think it is important because, for most Americans listening out there, what you are witnessing is the tyranny of the majority. What I mean by that is, when the minority doesn’t get an opportunity to bring forth witnesses, to have hearings—and you heard Mr. NEALtalk about the more than 30 hearings in the committee, the more than 12 subcommittee hearings, the 450plus experts that we never got to hear from—you understand the position that we find ourselves in. As I said earlier, this impacts 100 percent of our economy and 100 percent of our people. We all swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution, but apparently on the other side, they swear an oath of allegiance to Grover Norquist because that is more important than fulfilling our constitutional responsibility and going through regular order and having the experts. It is more important to take a pledge to Mr. Norquist and pass something politically in as pure a bareknuckle way as you possibly can without any amendments being made in order and rushing the bill to the floor in haste, without any concern for the ramifications that it has other than fulfilling a pledge to Mr. Norquist, and also a pledge, as we have heard from some of their Members, to their donor base. That is what has frustrated us on this side of the aisle. I think Mr. NEAL said it very clearly, we had a missed opportunity here. Mr. KINDmentioned that we still have that opportunity. If there are enough people on that side of the aisle—and we know there are. We know regionally, as Mr. KINGand Mr. ZELDIN have said, that this tax bill represents the greatest shift that we have seen in wealth in this country from the middle class of the Northeast and West Coast to the rest of the country. It is unconscionable that this would take place under the guise of trying to say that you are providing middle class tax relief. I went to the commissioner of revenue services in the State of Connecticut and asked: How will this impact our citizens? It represents an increase in taxes for the middle class, not this socalled tax cut that the other side has perpetrated. I want to point out this claw that exists within here. Because even for those States, red State or blue State, where you think you might receive a de minimis tax cut today, it is clawed back within 5 years because they put something in the Code, commonly referred to as a ‘‘chained CPI.’’ And that has dire ramifications. Mr. LEVIN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. NEAL. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to ask you to yield just at this moment. The gentleman talked about a tax cut for the middle class. The problem with this terrible process is there isn’t time enough to challenge those who say something that is false. I just want to read again what the Speaker said relating to your point. He said this: ‘‘The focus is on middle class tax relief. The focus is on directing that tax relief to the people in the middle and the people who are trying to get there.’’ This bill is the opposite. As we discussed with our ranking member at the markup, and we challenged it, the Joint Tax said to us: Well, I think—and we will show this to you—that there are going to be millions of people in the middle class who, in subsequent years, will have their taxes increased, not decreased. Millions. When we asked about the passthrough—picking up on the gentleman’s point about the middle class—he pointed to tables which showed that the vast majority of the moneys that are going to go through passthroughs, that are going to get some tax help, the vast majority are for very wealthy people. While we don’t have the final figures, it is likely that 85 to 90 percent is going to go to the very wealthy. I think so much of what they have said is so untrue. They say that necessity is the mother of invention. In this case, necessity, their political necessity, has been the mother of deception. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I continue to yield to the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan. He is absolutely right. I want to also point out that we did ask Mr. Barthold, the Chief of Staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, about this tax and what its ramifications are. I asked him: Will this fall unevenly as we have seen across the Northeast and as we have seen across the West Coast? The response was: It is not possible to say that in all cases—meaning all 50 States—that these taxpayers will have lower total income tax liability under H.R. 1 than under the present law. Why? Because they are not going to be allowed to take the deductions they normally get. In the State of Connecticut, 41 percent of our citizens utilize and itemize their deductions under the code that they have been able to do since 1913 and its inception. Why is this important? Well, we have heard Mr. BRADY say— after everyone gets up and speaks, he talks about what is going on in their district in an overgeneralized manner. So I asked Joint Tax: What would it be for a couple in West Hartford with a child in college? They own a home and have a combined income of $125,000. Under the Republican plan, they would see a $767 tax increase in 2018, and they would see more than a $1,667 tax increase in 2023, when the family credit expires, a point Mr. NEALhas made repeatedly. Tax cuts are made permanent for corporations and the wealthy. The wealthy get the alternative minimum tax and they get the estate tax and they are made permanent. For those of you who may think you are even going to get a tax cut, the Norquist clawback provision, under something we referred to as ‘‘chained CPI,’’ takes it away after the fifth year. So we find ourselves in this godawful position without public hearings and without the ability to call expert witnesses and to only have a backand forth between Democrats and Republicans. The Republicans need a political win. That is probably true. But who really needs to win here are the American people. The American people expect more of us. That is why this is a loss possibility and why we ought to be regrouping and taking this back up, because, as Mr. KINDsays, there still is time. How can you turn your backs on your fellow Republicans in New York, in New Jersey, in Pennsylvania? How can you do this to these people without any kind of public hearing or public witnesses or experts to talk about what the calamity will be? How about their commissioners of revenue services coming in and going over and examining just how these taxes will impact on them? That is not going to happen, unfortunately. This is being jammed down our throats. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to ask Mr. WELCH , who made it to Vermont via Springfield, who has a longstanding interest in higher education—maybe he could talk about parts of Vermont that are very rural and also link it to that whole notion of higher education in the State of Vermont. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to. Just by way of introduction, I thank the ranking member for his leadership. As the gentleman said, the biggest challenge we face in this country—and it is not a Democrat or Republican issue—is that wages have been stagnant for Americans for 20 years. They haven’t had a pay raise. That is a huge challenge because the American Dream has always been premised on the fact that our parents have made an economy that has provided more opportunity for their kids. Wages are flat. America hasn’t had a pay raise in 20 years. So the fundamental question for me on a tax bill is whether that tax bill will increase opportunity for hardworking Americans. And it doesn’t matter where they are 
from, rural or urban. It doesn’t matter what their race is. It doesn’t matter what their gender or their sexual orientation is. Most Americans want to work and they want to take care of the people they love and they want to have an opportunity. This tax bill comes up real short. By the way, I want to be somewhat self critical of the Democrats. We haven’t been where we have needed to be, oftentimes, which is for hardworking Americans, but I think we are solidly where we need to be on this tax bill. Mr. Speaker, I will give the gentleman a couple of examples in explicit response to his question. I went out to a school that provided training for young Vermont men and women who wanted to become welders. That is a great job. They get out of school and they get a job that pays them good wages. They have got to borrow money in order to do that. In some cases, they have an employer who pays their tuition. Under this tax bill, that young woman or that young man who gets tuition assistance from his or her employer has to declare that as income and pay taxes on it. That is an opportunity tax. A lot of those folks have borrowed money. We have got a wonderful Vermont Student Assistance Corporation program. It doesn’t matter whether you are a Republican child or a Democratic child, you get low interest loans. They have lost their tax deduction. This is when they are beginning their career, so their income is not great, and they are trying to pay their bills, maybe get a condominium; maybe, if they are really lucky, get a house. They have got to pay more taxes as a result of this bill. The other thing is private activity bonds. This is unbelievable because what those bonds are—I didn’t know much about this before I came to Congress—but it is a benefit where there can be an opportunity to borrow money from the private market, by the way, in order to provide low interest rates. The people who buy these bonds get the benefit of a tax deduction in order to provide a continuing benefit to lower interest rates for kids who are trying to get a welding degree or a community college degree or a higher education degree. We are taking that away. We are taking away opportunity. We are imposing a big tax on the opportunity for young women and men in Vermont. There is not a single Republican who would want to do that. But we don’t have an opportunity in this bill to propose an amendment, to say: Hey, wait a minute. We made a mistake on this provision because we don’t want the wouldbe welders in Alabama, the wouldbe welders in Texas, the would be welders in Vermont to have to pay more in order to develop a skill that is really essential to making those joints on our bridges and doing the things that we need to rebuild our cities. We are not allowed an opportunity to propose an amendment where every single American would know whether your Representative wanted to impose an opportunity tax on that student who wants to become a welder. Where is the democracy in this? Where is the transparency in this? That is what really is heartache for me. As Chairman Neal knows, we grew up in the same city and it was rough and tumble, working class, proud people, and ethnic. b2045 We played hard in sports, and we battled all the time. But we had a kind of common pride in the value of work. We saw how hard our parents worked. We didn’t necessarily notice that when we should have when we were younger. But as we grew up, we really were stunned at the kind of commitment they had to rebuilding the city that we were in and the gentleman became mayor of. We became so appreciative of the opportunity they gave us. I grew up in a family of six kids, and how my parents did it in a small house with four bedrooms and sharing a bedroom, we didn’t know. It was only after the fact that we became aware of how wonderful this opportunity was that they gave us and the sacrifices that they made. Isn’t it our job in this House of Representatives to give everybody the same opportunity to the experience that Mr. NEALhad, that Mr. L IPINSKI  had, and that I had? That was on the shoulders of parents who sacrificed for our benefit. So the bottom line for me on this tax bill is whether it enhances the opportunity of every American striver, every American who wants to become better, more contributing, more of an active citizen, more of an accomplished adult, and more of a contributor to our workforce. Does this bill help them achieve that or does it impede them from doing that? When I look just at one specific provision where we say that students are going to have to pay taxes on the interest that they pay on their student loan or when a student who earns, in fact, a scholarship or a fellowship to go advance their higher education and they have to pay income tax on that, I am truly horrified because this country— and this is not a RepublicanDemocratic deal—is all based on the optimism that, if we give people opportunity, it will benefit all of us. It will benefit that individual who is there to seize that opportunity and make the best of what they can do and, therefore, build the country. So, Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the ranking member’s efforts on this. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Vermont. It was a very nice description of our hometown, Springfield, Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Chicago, Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ), who is a good friend to all of us here. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. NEAL, the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, for all his work. I want to talk tonight from the perspective of Blue Dog Democrats. Now, clearly, we all know—and Mr. WELCH very eloquently talked about the needs of the middle class and people who are struggling—it is far past time that we reform the Tax Code by making it simpler, closing loopholes, and lowering rates. However, this bill that we are going to be voting on tomorrow is certainly not the answer for the middle class. Now, it didn’t have to be this way. Throughout the year, I heard from Republican lawmakers and from the White House about the benefits of creating a bipartisan tax reform plan. As the policy cochair of the Blue Dog Coalition representing modern Democrats, I coordinated the coalition’s creation of key principles needed for a permanent, bipartisan tax reform bill. Our reform principles called for the following: First, tax reform must be passed with an open, bipartisan process and through regular order. Second, tax reform must be credibly revenue neutral and should not use unrealistic economic growth projections to offset the costs of tax reform or tax relief. Third, American companies need a more competitive corporate tax rate and structure in order to maintain their ability to compete globally. Congress must also account for the needs of small businesses when it comes to setting tax rates. Fourth, and most importantly, the middle class must be the priority in this tax bill. Fifth, Congress should use tax reform to address the funding challenges for the highway trust fund. Taken together, I think most people would say that this is a good, sound set of principles; but, disappointingly, H.R. 1 fails to meet these criteria. First, this bill is not bipartisan. The Blue Dogs met with the Treasury Secretary, the Director of the National Economic Council, as well as the chairman of the committee. We were told that they wanted this to be a bipartisan bill. But the bill was passed in committee less than a week after it was introduced and less than a day—even less than that—after lastminute changes were made by the chairman. The committee voted down every Democratic amendment on a partyline vote, and 1 week later, this bill is being brought to the floor with no amendments allowed. This is clearly not bipartisan, and it is tough to argue that this is an open process of regular order where Members get to participate in the process. But what about the contents of the bill? First, it is not revenue neutral. We were told that this bill would be revenue neutral using dynamic scoring, that is, when considering additional revenue that will be raised from increased economic growth because of 
the tax cuts. Some dismiss dynamic scoring out of hand, but I believe that it can be legitimate. But as we were about to vote on the bill, even the idea of having an official dynamic score of this bill before voting on it seems to have completely disappeared. What we do know is that the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation says it will add nearly $1.5 trillion plus interest to our debt, which is currently $20 trillion and growing. The one rough dynamic score that has been produced by the rightwing Tax Foundation shows that this bill, as originally introduced, would still add over $1 trillion to our debt. The new debt is not even used to put the needs of middle class Americans first. The bulk of the benefits from the bill favor businesses and corporations rather than individual taxpayers. The Tax Policy Center estimates that families would only get the benefit of about onethird of the tax cuts offered by the bill, with corporations and other businesses getting twice as much. This is because of the unbalanced way in which business tax rates are lowered with relatively few cuts to corporate deductions. But as we have heard many of our speakers talk about all of the deductions, they are going to hurt middle class Americans as they try to deal with growing expenses for healthcare, education, and childcare. Of course, true tax reform can alter some of these provisions in order to simplify the Tax Code. But we must make sure that, at the end of the day, middle class families’ pocketbooks are not harmed by the changes that we make. While many tout that this bill doubles the standard deduction, it is important to understand that it also eliminates personal exemptions. This means that families with children or other dependents may be worse off. There are other examples of deductions lost that will negatively impact middle class families. We have heard many of them, including the medical expense deduction. That means that families with very high expenses, such as longterm care for extraordinary illnesses, will pay higher tax bills. The bill also makes student loan borrowers pay new taxes on the loan interest they pay. The list goes on. One particularly contentious part of this bill is that it severely curtails the deduction individual taxpayers take for State and local taxes paid. Supporters of this idea claim that this deduction is an unfair subsidy from the Federal Government to hightax cities and States, but in my own State of Illinois where taxpayers will get hit hard by this, we already get only 79 cents back from the Federal Government for every dollar we contribute in taxes. Taking away the State and local tax deduction will only make this discrepancy worse. Now, one particularly troubling aspect of this bill is that, while it adds some new incentives to make it easier to raise children and support families, these incentives expire after 5 years, even as provisions that primarily benefit highincome taxpayers and corporations are made permanent. When analyzed as a whole, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center predicts that any tax relief some middle class families might receive from this bill will disappear over time. Yet families in the top of 1 percent and even the top onetenth of 1 percent will not only see immediate relief, but even larger returns in the long run. Finally, this bill does nothing to address a major tax issue that our Nation faces: the fact that the highway trust fund that pays for Federal roads and transit projects is taking more and more money every year out of general revenue. We need to fix the highway trust fund, and if we did that here, we could also start finally doing some of those trilliondollar infrastructure projects that the President keeps talking about. So, once again, in this bill, the House is choosing to pursue a needlessly partisan, closed process for major legislation with wideranging impacts and enormous price tags. I really urge my colleagues to change course. Pursue a truly bipartisan reform so that we do well by American families and businesses that need Congress to act on this critical issue. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member NEALfor all his work on this. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 1
1⁄2 minutes remaining. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Mr. LIPINSKI and the group that is assembled here tonight. I want to encourage the American people to pay attention beginning again tomorrow morning at 9 o’clock when we are going to finish the debate on this legislation. I hope that as they pay attention to it they will consider what a missed opportunity this was, a reminder that one of the most complex pieces of legislation offered in the years I have been here had no public hearings. Not one witness was summonsed to give advice on a tax bill of this consequence. It has been advertised as a middle class tax cut. I can assure you that 36 million Americans are going to pay more when this is done. Also, another reminder to pay close attention to is that our friends down the hallway in the Senate are going to include an end to the mandate, which is the glue that holds together the Affordable Care Act, in a further effort to take away health insurance from 13 million people to pay for a tax cut. This could have been done together, Democrats and Republicans. We wanted to do it. We were shut out of this process from day one. Remember, this legislation was offered last Thursday. A manager’s mark was published Friday. We went to markup on Monday, and we were done on Thursday. There was no opportunity for us to participate. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
TAX REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to do actually two or three things specifically tonight. One is walk through a bunch of data on why the tax reform proposal is actually just sort of crucial to our society and where we are going and, number two, actually walk through some impressions of being one of the new members on Ways and Means. I have been here in the U.S. House; now I am in my seventh year here. I have only been on the Ways and Means Committee now for a year. It has been one of the most fascinating experiences of my life because of the number of meetings, the diving into data, the ability to sort of make things mesh together and make the math work, with an understanding of how serious this is. The problem is, in the somewhat toxic partisan environment we are in right now, I know there are some of my friends on the other side who are really uncomfortable with the idea of Republicans having a win. b2100 I know there are others who are constantly looking for what the partisan wedge is. I am going to ask, at least for just a couple of moments, that we sort of think through something altogether. We are going to walk through some of these boards. If you see this one right here, this is with the borrowing from all the trust funds. But our country is already 105 percent of debt. If you add up the publicly held debt and that from borrowing from the trust funds, it is over 105 percent of debt to GDP. Lots and lots of economists get really nervous when you start to say: Hey, in just a few years, the amount of debt issued by this government will be the size of the entire economy. This is issue, not borrowing from trust funds. Understand that the curve is steepening because the trust fund balances are falling. We are finally hitting that inflection period where demographics are moving our numbers. Remember, the peak of the baby boom is 60 years old today. We have obligations that we as a society have made to our brothers and sisters who are getting older. We have a real problem. You are going to see in a number of these slides that if we continue to stay as a society, as a country, that is only growing. Remember, the projection right now is 1.8 percent growth over the next 20 years. You mathematically cannot meet your obligations. It is called a debt crisis. It is called an entitlement crisis. 
One of the key solutions to being able to meet our obligations, to meet our promises, is we need a society, an economy that is growing. If you love people, if you care about them, if you want them to be able to save and have opportunity and a future, you need a society that is economically expanding. I accept that this body is often about our next reelection. This is an observation that I learned this year. There are some things that are in the Tax Code that are brilliant politics. They get you reelected. They give you something warm and fuzzy to go talk about at home. They are really bad economics. It is hard to stand in front of a group and say: Hey, we get to deduct State and local taxes. Yay. Then you look at the economic expansion modeling of it and there is almost no economic growth for a huge amount of spending. I know it is a sensitive issue with a lot of my brothers and sisters here on both the right and left who are from hightax jurisdictions, but understand one of the reasons it has been looked at is that it is a tremendous amount of spending in the Tax Code and there is almost no economic expansion from that spending. Whereas, if that same spending in the Tax Code is in things that grow businesses, grow job opportunities, grow the ability to save, you can actually see the modeling where the economy gets bigger, where all of us have job opportunities, and over the coming years, you get paid more because the economy is growing. This is great politics. This is good economics. I don’t think those of us on the Republican side know it—and I know so often we get behind these microphones and we all sound like accountants on steroids—but the math is important. How many times has this body made public policy that felt good, that was good politics, and really crappy economics? That is how you wake up one day and your society is $20 trillion in debt and the curve is about to blow off the charts. Remember, a lot of outside groups on the right and left have been doing modeling, saying there will be a debt crisis in about a decade and a half. It is coming, and it is coming very, very fast at us. To have an understanding of just how difficult these numbers are, on this chart I have up here, do you see the red area? This is for 2027. But you figure we just finished the 2018 appropriations and budgets, so we are already starting to plan the 2019. Well, 8 functionally budget years from now, only 11 percent of this Federal Government’s spending will be for things that people think of as government. Everything else—defense and entitlements, mandatory spending, both earned entitlements and unearned entitlements—will be everything other than 11 percent of the spending. Public lands, the FBI, the Justice Department, the Park Service, health research, education, all the things you think of as government will be only 11 percent of our spending. Everything else will be either military—the military will also be only 11 percent—and everything else after that is mandatory. It continues to grow that way. If you are someone who cares about education, who cares about the environment, who cares about these things, understand that if you do not start to get some dramatic economic growth, you are going to be squeezed out. The dollars spent on your priorities are disappearing. It is math. We do not have the revenues. It is going to get crushed. It is coming very, very fast. This isn’t Republican math or Democrat math. It is math. What if I came to you right now and asked: What is one of the most powerful things we can do as a society to keep our promises? My brothers and sisters on the left often talk about our promises to retirees. They are absolutely right. The fact of the matter is, I believe that for someone who retires in the next couple of years, they will have put in about $190,000 for their Medicare. They are going to receive over $600,000. That is in, like, dollars. Multiply that by 76 million baby boomers in that 18year period. In just that differential, understand that one of the root causes is demographics. We still made a promise. The way you are able to cover that promise is economic growth. When you look at this chart, it is fairly new from a Stanford economist. I found this in a book about 2 months ago. Do you see that red line on the lefthand side? Do you see where it lays fairly flat? That is actually a line that says: ‘‘Entitlement spending to GDP.’’ The size of the economy, the entitlement spending in the 1990s, in the late 1980s didn’t go down. It was still going up. The difference was the economy got bigger. So when you hear us talk about debt toGDP ratios, start thinking about that denominator. How do you grow the economy so that if we keep our promises, it doesn’t crash the economy and functionally almost bring the world down? We have some charts that make it very clear that when we have been in times of economic expansion, we have even been able to spend more money on these entitlement programs; yet we bent the debt curve and the amount of that consumption to the size of the economy. I know this gets a little geeky, but at some point the math is important. I know we just spent a couple of hours talking about peoples’ feelings on a 400 or 500page tax bill, but let’s get some of the math correct. Understand that the chart next to me is sort of the CBO projections. The math is worse than even the CBO projections. If you can look—and I know this is small—but the CBO missed the 2017 number by over $100 billion. The fiscal year we just finished, the 2017 fiscal year, we borrowed $666 billion. This is one of the good years. So, remember, you have heard people talking about in a static score over the next decade—10 years—this tax bill costs a $1.5 trillion. But we borrowed $666 billion last year, with no tax relief and a government policy that functionally gave us a 1.8 percent GDP. Take a look at this year. It was supposed to get much better, but now that we know we have the spending for the hurricanes and disasters, we know we are going to blow through that. If you can see it in about 4 budget years, because of that 1.8 percent economic expansion, we are going to start borrowing $1 trillion a year. Yes, building a tax bill with $1.5 trillion borrowing over 10 years is something you have to really think about. You need to design it so we get the economic expansion so that the size of the economy gets bigger so there are opportunities to take in new revenues. But do understand that if you are part of the side that you are just hearing supporting the status quo, the status quo is already a disaster and is just on the cusp of time. The disaster is already here. The disaster is status quo and doing more of the same. In 4 budget years, you are borrowing $1 trillion a year, and it goes up from that. So doing nothing, continuing the status quo, is the entitlement crisis, is the fiscal cliff, is the debt crisis. We don’t have a choice. We must get together and do what is necessary to get this economy growing. We heard one of the previous speakers—who is one of the people I really like; he is a good guy; a Democrat of Illinois—talk about the Tax Foundation. I sort of forgot this part. This is a quote from the Tax Foundation study. It is $1 trillion in new revenues. Our static score that we are doing— and the Tax Foundation score is higher in spending—but our model says it is $1.5 trillion of spending in the Tax Code static. That means no economic growth. We are going to talk about what dynamic growth is. They say a new, additional trillion dollars of revenue. That is what we call dynamic scoring. What is dynamic scoring, you may ask. Dynamic scoring is nothing more than asking: How does this policy affect the size of the economy? And then you loop it back and look for the feedback effects. If you are a Democrat and you are saying, ‘‘I don’t believe in dynamic scoring,’’ you really need to think about that position because you believe in dynamic scoring when the left introduced an immigration bill. It was dynamically scored. Global warming. If you actually look at the scoring, it has feedback effects. Go back to the stimulus. 
We all use dynamic scoring around here. We just seem to only want to embrace it when it supports our own political views. Every March, the Congressional Budget Office gives us an update that has economic feedback effect in it. That is called dynamic scoring. For both my friends on the right and the left, you can’t just pretend that public policy has no effect in the size of the economy when it is contrary to your certain political pitch that you are making right now. Just understand, the Tax Foundation says $1 trillion in new revenues. But the other things that are really important—and this actually starts to give you an understanding of some of the effects—is we have close to $300 billion in new payroll taxes. Understanding that Social Security and Medicare are payasyougo programs, today’s taxpayers are functionally paying today’s recipients. That is why I have been behind this microphone over the last year talking about things like demographics and birth rates and the really dangerous effects these low birth rates are having in the society, but that is other stuff. We will have almost $300 billion in new payroll taxes. So I have $1 trillion in new income taxes and close to $300 billion in new payroll taxes for what we model is a trillionandahalfdollar static score. You may not like the numbers, but the Tax Foundation is really good at this. They have some of the most advanced models that exist anywhere in this country and it is worth going to and reading their information. Right now, when you hear us talking, we are giving you just static scores. It is important to know that the freaky smart people are out there modeling, saying what we are doing is expanding the size of the economy as you go into the future. Why is this so critical? If you see this chart, this is what is being projected for our future. This is the CBO’s estimates over the next, I believe it is, three decades. b2115 Functionally, a 1.8 percent GDP growth. This is their projection. This is what they see our future looking like. But if you go back to the 1950s—to 1973, yeah, we had a demographic bubble that was young and moving into the workforce. If you look at the late 1970s, 1990s, we were actually doing an average of 3.3 percent GDP a year. If you actually are someone like I am where you just are fascinated— GDPNow, which is the Atlanta Fed’s calculator, right now, has our GDP, as of today, at 3.2 percent GDP. That is amazing. The model we have been given says we should be at 1.8. We are substantially above that right now in anticipation of tax reform. Apparently, a lot of the economy out there is already anticipating a better regulatory market and a better tax regime, and, with that, they are spending, they are investing, and we are already seeing it in the baseline numbers. This is something we can’t screw up. It is incredibly important. So let’s try to understand, once again, if you care and love people and want them to have an economic future, why that growth is so incredibly important. If you actually sort of look at the difference—and this is sort of a difficult chart to understand. But if we are sitting here somewhere between this 1
1⁄2and 2 percent GDP growth, and you wanted to double the size of the economy, you are looking at having to wait over 35 years. What happens if we were in the very tail end? And look, from my own math, I don’t think we get there. We might have some years that touch it. But what would happen if you were at 4 percent GDP growth? You go from over 35 years to a little over 17 years to double the size of the economy. Well, how about if we could beat 3
1⁄2percent GDP? You go from over 35 years to 22 years. Just understand the size of the economy has almost everything to do with what you are paid, your ability to have a pay raise, your ability to have enough cash flow in your life so you can save for your retirement. I know this seems like an academic lecture, but it is not. These things affect our lives. They also affect our ability to pay our promises. It also affects our ability to protect our Nation. It is not a game. So another way to sort of look at the same numbers—and I just happen to like this chart, so that is one of the reasons we are putting it up. You can see sort of the bubbles. What would it take to sort of double that GDP per person? You know, okay, so instead of the entire economy, how about you, as an American citizen, the size of the economy as you—because as a participant in the economy, this has something to do with what you are paid, your ability on your lifestyle, the things you can own, the things you can do for your family. The difference between the 2 percent—and let’s just jump up to 4 percent, and the number of years, you start to realize the difference between 17 years or 35 years. This is about every one of us as an individual in this country that if we can adopt tax policy, that is good for families, good for the middle class, but also makes us competitive in the world again, and we start to grow, good things happen. Do you do a Tax Code that is great politics or really good economics? Some of the math is hard. We live in a society right now where if you can look at the very far left side of this chart, the top 20 percent of our society, of our income earners—the top 20 percent of income earners are paying 88 percent of the Federal income taxes. You start to understand. If I came to you right now, just as a simple math problem, and said, ‘‘Hey, I have got 20 percent of very high income earners who are paying 88 percent of all the Federal income taxes, but I really want to make sure that the quartiles of our hardworking middleincome earners are getting a lot of this benefit,’’ you can understand why there were such great math problems in making these things work, because 88 percent of all your Federal revenue is sitting out here with 20 percent of the population. That is actually why we have had to do a lot of the things we have done. And where certain deductions, certain things phase out, it is just a math problem. But remember, you see that red line, and you see where it crosses the blue line? That is where publicly held debt will exceed the size of our economy. This government will have issued debt to foreign buyers, to your retirement account, to pension funds that will exceed the size of this economy, and it is only a few years away, and that is what the status quo is. That is where we are going. I will make you the argument, we don’t have a choice. We must make a simpler, a fairer, but a dramatic and more progrowth tax system as part of this country’s culture. In being blessed to now be on the Ways and Means Committee, which I am incredibly appreciative—they are some of the smartest people I have ever worked with, are really smart calculators and people—there is something called Joint Tax. If you ever want to know where all the freaky smart people or president of your high school math class are, there is 50 of them in there. I think like more than half may have Ph.D.’s in math and statistics and accounting. They tell us, the testimony to the committee is, 94 percent of the tax paying population will now do their taxes on this. Only 6 percent of taxpayers in the country will need to itemize. There is actually some really interesting math that also starts to happen when you have made a tax system fairer, simpler, and progrowth. But the simplicity of it makes compliance, makes the ability to pay, makes the ability to participate so much easier and so much more elegant. I have been proud to be part of the team that has helped build this tax plan. It is not perfect, and it is still going to go through a couple of more changes. That is the way it works. We will get the Senate product; we will sit in conference committee; we will work out the math; but understand the status quo is disastrous for every American, and I actually believe it is disastrous for the world. The tax reform gives us an opportunity to grow and have an incredibly bright future if we do it the right way. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
