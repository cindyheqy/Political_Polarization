Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed to hear that the Senate will not be able to take up the healthcare bill this week, but this is a tough issue. It is a tough issue because, at least on my side of the aisle, we want to do the right thing. We want to make sure that people can buy health insurance that is affordable and accessible, and not pull the rug out from under people who have issues. In the House, we passed a bill, and one of the big issues was preexisting conditions. We made sure that people with preexisting conditions can buy health insurance that is reasonably priced, similar to people who have no preexisting conditions, but then we kicked in billions of dollars to subsidize those premiums to help those people be in the insurance market because I think it is important that those people are in the insurance market and have access to insurance that is affordable. I think it is really unAmerican to pull the rug out from people because they got sick. ObamaCare is imploding. In Ohio— and this is from the Health and Human Services Agency—ObamaCare in Ohio, since 2013, premiums have increased 86 percent. We had almost 236,000 families pay almost $44 million in penalties because they couldn’t afford their health insurance. Then there is also a myth out there that the price is going through the roof, it is collapsing because of the current administration. Well, if you look at the facts, the average premium skyrocketed by nearly $3,000 across the country during the previous administration’s final term. Eightythree insurers left the market, and the average exchange premium spiked 25 percent last year alone. Americans living in roughly onethird of our Nation’s counties have only one option of healthcare coverage precisely because this law has continued to fail. All this has occurred prior to the current administration. Mr. Speaker, I got a phone call last night from a lady whom I have known for over 30 years. She is selfemployed, running a servicetype business, and she was struggling to pay for her healthcare under the ObamaCare exchanges. She has prayed these last few years that she wouldn’t get sick because she wouldn’t be able to meet the deductible. She works 12hour days. She is in one of those at least 20 counties in Ohio that will not have an insurer on the individual market for next year. She has no options to buy health insurance next year. She called me up and said: I don’t know what I am going to do. I didn’t have a good answer for her. That is why we need to get this done. Prior to ObamaCare—I don’t know if a lot of people realize this—when I was a selfemployed farmer, I bought my health insurance through association plans. ObamaCare did away with association plans and forced people onto the exchanges and mandated what kind of coverage you had to buy. Ironically, as a Member of Congress, I am required to be on ObamaCare, and I am. But the ironic thing is, next year, if things don’t change—and I was forced to be on the D.C. exchange, but if I was forced to be on my county exchange back where I live, my county does not have a health insurer in the individual market next year. I think it is ironic as a Member of Congress, if I wasn’t on the D.C. exchange, I wouldn’t be able to buy insurance through my exchange back home because it will not be available. How do we fix this? I think we have to incorporate free market principles. We have to get the cost down, and then the market will work. How do we get the cost down? We have to have price discovery, and how you get that is through competition. I think health savings accounts is one way you will get competition and personal responsibility. People will shop around on a nonemergencytype basis, and it will help drive the cost down. ObamaCare did away with health savings accounts. Also, tort reform. We need to make sure that doctors practicing medicine don’t have to worry about frivolous lawsuits and fight defensive medicine. That is really important. 
We need to be able to buy insurance across State lines. We have it in property and casualty insurance. We have it in auto insurance. We ought to have it in health insurance. It ought to be portable, you take it with you. And you also have your health savings account that you can take with you and be portable. These are some of the things that we can do, but we have to let the market work. That is my hope. And this is a tough issue. The Senate is working through it. They want to do the right thing. They want to make sure that Americans have affordable, highquality health insurance coverage that they can buy. We need to work through that, and I think the Senate will get there. Hopefully, we will get a bill on the President’s desk so my friend, whom I have known for over 30 years, can buy health insurance next year and not have to worry about the risk of what happens if she gets sick, or if she will have to go on Medicaid. Mr. Speaker, one out of four Americans today are on Medicaid. That is not really a good option. I am seeing some of our physicians are not treating Medicaid patients. Do you know why that is? Because they are a service business, and there are only so many hours in the day. So they have to have people with health insurance or selfpayers, and they can’t have too many people on their client portfolio that have Medicaid with reimbursements that are too low for the cost of service. That is what we have moved to. 
PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I listen to my friend from Ohio, and I am just kind of wondering how he gets to his position. The Affordable Care Act didn’t do away with health savings accounts, and that is a fact that can be easily verified. Or the notion that somehow Medicaid is a negative because it was expanded, and the gentleman’s own Governor has been arguing here against the Republican plan because it would eviscerate Medicaid. Medicaid provides more healthcare than any other program in America. Sadly, what we have seen is that the proposals that have been coming forward are way off the mark, just like my friend from Ohio a moment ago. The claims that it would not cut Medicaid, claims to make the system better, and save the Affordable Care Act from collapse are mythology. The Congressional Budget Office report—these are the independents scorekeepers, and, in fact, the head of the Congressional Budget Office was appointed by the Republicans, their 49 page report that is available online to any Member of Congress, to the public—pointed out that the health exchanges are not collapsing. They are actually in pretty good shape and they could be made stronger with relatively simple changes, because what we have seen for the last 7 years, the Republican plan has been to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, to make it worse, to create more uncertainty. Recently, the administration refused to advertise to help people join this year’s enrollment period and eliminated enforcement of the mandate, making the market even more unstable. How do we have such an alternative universe? Well, I suggest that one of the problems is that my friends on the Republican side of the aisle who crafted the House bill and who are working in secret in the Senate crafting the Senate bill listen to the wrong people. They listen to a small group, some of whom benefit from the Republican approach because there are extra subsidies that go to them, or people who benefit from massive tax cuts that, frankly, they don’t need. They listen to people who are all about political talking points and not about the facts of healthcare in America. Most of all, they don’t talk to real people on the ground who would be affected. In what universe is a $773 billion cut over the next 10 years to Medicaid not a reduction? Tell a 75yearold widow who is looking at being in a nursing home for the rest of her life—6 percent of our Medicaid funding goes to people in nursing homes. It is almost half of the total funding. Tell them that that is not going to be a cut, that that is not going to reduce services, maybe not make it available at all. Sixtyfour percent of people in nursing homes rely on Medicaid. There are 15 million people who are not going to have healthcare if the Republican proposal goes into effect, according to the objective independent scorekeepers. But you can look at the calculations yourself as a member of the public. The Kaiser organization has a calculator where you can figure out if people are better off under the existing plan or under the Republican alternative. A person in Utah making $15,000 would pay $400 after tax credits, but have a $6,000 deductible. They are not talking to real people. A situation in Baker City, Oregon, a 40yearold is going to face a 128 percent increase if the Republican proposal goes into effect. A 60yearold woman in Strong, Maine, making almost $40,000 a year is currently eligible for a credit of about $7,000, which means she gets a comprehensive policy in 2020 for $4,500. But the Republican Senate plan would result in her costs in 2020 being $15,000 a year, onethird of her income. Mr. Speaker, I invite the public to investigate for themselves and see who the Republicans aren’t listening to. TRIO PROGRAM ESSENTIAL FOR STUDENTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about TRIO programs, which, for more than 50 years, have helped millions of lowincome students attend college. Often, these students are the first in their family to earn a college degree. TRIO programs have helped lowincome and disabled students who want to pursue a higher education, but thought college was unaffordable and out of reach. Children from disadvantaged families often struggle to access important mentoring, tutoring, and other hands on services designed to help encourage high school completion and the pursuit of postsecondary education. Sadly, these students are often unprepared for college academics and require remedial courses that add to the challenges of completing a program. Too many disadvantaged students simply give up on even applying to college because they are confused by the application process, overwhelmed by the cost, or are unaware of the available financial aid options, despite our best efforts to ensure the information is available and understandable. Recognizing these challenges, the Federal Government has created several programs to help disadvantaged students access the support necessary to realize the dream of a college degree. For example, college preparation and retention programs such as TRIO, Upward Bound, Talent Search, and Student Support Services provide a pipeline of support services that encourage lowincome students to graduate high school and earn a postsecondary degree. Mr. Speaker, just last week, the House unanimously approved the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act to reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Act and support skillsbased career education. This bill will help close the skills gap that exists today and prepare students for indemand jobs. TRIO programs are just as important to help those who want to pursue a college degree have the resources necessary to do so. As a senior member on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I am a strong supporter of TRIO. I am also a member of the House TRIO Caucus. I want all Americans to have higher education opportunities if that is the path that they choose. The TRIO program dates back to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 in response to the administration’s War on Poverty. That is when Upward Bound was formed. In 1965, Talent Search, the second outreach program, was created as part of the Higher Education Act. 
b1015 In 1968, Student Support Services, which was originally known as Special Services for Disadvantaged Students, was authorized by the Higher Education Amendments and became the third in a series of educational opportunity programs. By the late 1960s, the term TRIO was coined to describe these three Federal programs. Over the years, the TRIO programs have been expanded and improved to provide a wider range of services and to reach more students who need assistance. In 1990, the Department created the Upward Bound Math and Science program to address the need for specific instruction in the fields of math and science. Mr. Speaker, as you can see, TRIO programs have a long history of helping lowincome individuals, firstgeneration college students, and individuals with disabilities reach their full potential. I support these programs, and I want to see every American reach his or her educational goals. 
IMMIGRANT HERITAGE MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, June is Immigrant Heritage Month in the United States, but to celebrate that, House Republicans have made this antiimmigration week in the Congress. The advocates against legal immigration have their annual talk radio festival here in D.C. this week to extol the virtues of cutting off legal immigration. Dozens of conservative talk radio hosts set up remote broadcasts here to talk about why criminalizing immigrants and turning misdemeanors into felonies is a good thing for America. They may trade stories, while broadcasting on the air, about immigrants doing horribly bad things to people in America, as if we were in a national crime spree of Brown people killing White people. The goal of talk radio hosts is to reinforce the antiimmigration fever that has gripped the Republican Party and allowed a toughsounding game show host to take over their party. The main organization behind the gathering of talk radio hosts is FAIR, the Federation Against American Immigration Reform, which we should note is designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. That is the organization in Alabama most directly responsible for suing the KKK out of the mainstream. It is like D. W. Griffith might rise up from his grave to film ‘‘Rebirth of a Nation—the Sequel’’ because FAIR and its allies want to take our immigration policies back to the 1920s when the Klan marched openly in Washington and legal immigration was reduced to almost zero. They want to get rid of anyone here who is deportable or could be deportable by passing new laws to criminalize them. Now, to coincide with the talk radio antiimmigration week, Republicans are putting on a passion play of their own in the House of Representatives by bringing two antiimmigrant bills to the floor. So we have a coordinated campaign from broadcasters, lawmakers, and the antiimmigration advocates to pressure Congress into passing bills to paint immigrants as a threat to our national and community safety—right out of the Trump playbook. The question is not whether or not these bills will pass the House—they will pass—but whether Democrats will be tempted to vote for toughsounding measures because they are afraid to be labeled by conservative talk radio hosts as weak on punishing the ‘‘murdering, rapist, drugdealing Mexicans’’ they think are lurking in every alley. Of course, that is not what these bills actually do at all. Truth and talk radio do not often go together—certainly not in the era of Trump. Let’s look at the two bills Republicans are bringing for a vote. One bill is H.R. 3004, named for Kate Steinle, a young woman who was shot and killed by an immigrant nearly 2 years ago in San Francisco. It happened in July, and as you may remember, I was the first person to come to the floor and give a speech denouncing Kate’s killer and calling for laws that keep people like him off the streets. A week later, while talking about various immigration issues in Spanish with Telemundo, a quote was included in a story about Kate Steinle’s killing. After it was aired, rightwing groups circulated it, alleging it was proof that I was insensitive to the Steinle family, when, in fact, I was not speaking about Kate Steinle at the time, and I had already spoken out specifically on Kate’s death here on the floor. But what is coming to the floor this week would not have kept Kate Steinle’s killer off the streets. It would have had no impact on that case whatsoever. Instead, we are voting on a bill to put other people in different circumstances in jail for longer periods of time. It is a baitandswitch strategy: use a horrible tragedy to sell a policy that would not have prevented that death so that we put more immigrants in jail for longer periods of time and prevent them from ever living legally in the United States. The other bill, H.R. 3003, is designed to take money away from America’s largest cities and counties, specifically from efforts to fight crime—yes, take money away from them. Grants that would help local police fight crime would be eliminated under this bill from 600 of the country’s largest jurisdictions. That doesn’t sound like crime fighting, because it isn’t. So why are we doing this? Because Republicans in Washington think they have a better idea of how to fight crime than the county executives, State legislators, mayors, and local police chiefs. ‘‘Do what we say or we will take away your money’’ is what the Republicans are saying to big cities and counties. That is the approach being taken by the conservatives who always talk about how State and local people should be trusted more and protected from Federal mandates. Well, I guess, not when it comes to immigrants. This is why these types of bills are opposed by the National Fraternal Order of Police and other police organizations. So to all the talk radio hosts and advocacy groups: Why are you on the side opposing the National Fraternal Order of Police? And why would any Democrat want to cross that blue line to stand with you? f 
MEGAN’S STORY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to tell Megan’s story from her point of view and her beliefs. She was smart, kind, ambitious, and funny. She loved other people. After attending high school in Austin, Texas, she enrolled in the University of Alabama. She had a beautiful life—that is, until she was sexually assaulted in January of 2015. After a night of drinking with her friends, Megan was ready to go home and go to bed. However, a finely dressed young businessman who referred to himself as ‘‘Sweet T’’ offered to give her a ride. You see, Mr. Speaker, ‘‘Sweet T’’ was from the richest family in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and just so happened to be a big financial backer of that university. Megan didn’t remember climbing into his sleek Mercedes, but she woke up at his Southern mansion and knew something was wrong. Megan said she resisted his initial advances and repeatedly told him she wanted to go home. He refused to do so. Instead, he sexually assaulted her, and then he fell off to sleep. She tried to get out of the room, but the door was locked. Desperate to escape, Megan climbed out of the mansion’s secondstory bedroom window and went to his car looking for her keys. It was there that she discovered a handgun Sweet T had in the car all the time but took it for her safety on her walk home. Doing everything a rape victim should do, she immediately called the police and went to the hospital. But it is here, Mr. Speaker, that the system, she says, started to fail her. The hospital wasn’t sufficiently trained in sexual assault procedure and botched the rape kit. Megan then went to the police station to give her statement about what happened to her. But it was there she was treated with disdain and disbelief by Tuscaloosa’s police department. After all, Megan was 
claiming that the son of one of the wealthiest families in Tuscaloosa had raped her. Despite her insistence that she said ‘‘no,’’ the police did not believe her. She said they didn’t want to believe her. An officer asked her why she didn’t punch or kick the rapist. The police thought it must have been consensual since she did not violently resist the attacker, and they moved on. But, Mr. Speaker, rape victims can never move on. It is something they carry with them for the rest of their lives. The scars left by the rape do not fade away for victims. Mr. Speaker, I was a prosecutor and judge in Texas for over 30 years. I met a lot of rape victims, and I learned how these attacks sometimes devastate their lives forever. Sexual assault is a very different type of crime. It rips the identity, the selfworth, and the very soul of the victim apart. It is the victim’s belief, in some cases, that it is a fate worse than death. It is easy to secondguess what someone should or should not have done after emotional trauma of sexual assault, but Megan believed she did everything a rape victim is supposed to do: She sought help, but she found none. The university failed her. The counselor assigned to her knew of the rapist’s family name, so the university wouldn’t give her any assistance and provided no other counselor. Megan was dismissed, ignored, blamed, and forgotten. In the months following the sexual assault, she was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. She was so depressed, she left the school and returned to Texas. Still feeling like there was no way to escape her pain, Megan took her life. Rape, Mr. Speaker, is never the fault of the victim. She deserved better. Now, I don’t know whether the perpetrator in this case is guilty or not. I am giving you Megan’s point of view. But what Megan believed was that she was failed by the hospital, law enforcement, and the University of Alabama. This past February before her death, Megan filled out a mental health clinic intake form at her new school, Southern Methodist University. One question asked if there had been any major losses, changes, or crises in her life. She wrote: ‘‘Raped, bullied by police, and I changed university.’’ Mr. Speaker, it is important and it is imperative that we understand victims of sexual assault. She got the death penalty for being the victim of sexual assault. She is not here to tell her story today, and I am telling it for her. And that is just the way it is. 
ALZHEIMER’S AWARENESS MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and that is Alzheimer’s disease. Since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer’s disease have increased by 89 percent. Right now, there are more than 5 million Americans with Alzheimer’s, and that number is expected to grow to 14 million—to almost triple—by the year 2050. Alzheimer’s and other dementias can be especially devastating both physically and emotionally for those who have these diseases and for their loved ones, your family and my family—for me, too many aunts and uncles, including my mother. When Lena Costa was diagnosed with the disease, she took it on with the same strength and courage she had used to beat cancer and survive heart disease. She was in her late eighties. Upon hearing the diagnosis, she turned to my sister and to me and said calmly and bravely: ‘‘Jim, Bette, I will just do the best I can.’’ Today, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s and there is no effective treatment for it. There is no proven way to prevent the disease or no method for slowing its progression. Unlike my mother, we are not currently doing the best we can. We must come together to support additional Alzheimer’s research—more funding. That is what we did in April when we in the House called for additional support for Alzheimer’s research at the National Institutes of Health. But we must do more. Alzheimer’s is a devastating disease. We must stand together, calmly and bravely, like my mom and so many of our loved ones who have been affected by Alzheimer’s throughout our country. Just as importantly, we must fix America’s healthcare system. Certainly, in the last week, we have proved that there is no Republican way or Democratic way, but there is an American way, and that is if we work together as Members of Congress to improve America’s healthcare system for all. EXECUTIVE ORDER 9066 —JAPANESE INTERNMENT  
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to speak also about Executive Order 9066, which was issued 75 years ago—75 years ago—by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The order authorized the evacuation and relocation of all persons deemed to be a threat to national security. What it did, however, was lead to one of the most shameful times in American history, and that was the internment of Japanese Americans. These were American citizens. From 1942 until 1945, the U.S. Government detained over 120,000 American citizens of Japanese ancestry and of resident immigrants forcing them to live in internment camps, taking them away from their homes, their farms, and their businesses, many in California, in the San Joaquin Valley. As American citizens, the internment denied them their constitutional right of due process. These were U.S. citizens who were robbed of their rights and their freedoms. Yet, some of these Japanese Americans, while their families were forced to live in internment camps, never forgot their patriotism. Many served in our Nation’s military in World War II in the European theater. The 442nd Infantry Regiment Combat Team was made up of JapaneseAmerican soldiers. b1030 The 442nd is the U.S. Army’s most decorated infantry regiment ever. We must remember this time in American history and not repeat it. We had three assembly centers in the San Joaquin Valley under Executive Order No. 9066, locations where Japanese Americans were forced to relocate and stay for weeks before they were finally sent to the larger internment camps in other parts of the West. The centers in my district were the Pinedale Assembly Center, the Fresno Assembly Center, and the Merced Assembly Center. They were fairgrounds. Today, we have three memorials on these sites to ensure that we will always remember and never again treat Americans in this reprehensible way. As Americans, let us never again give into our fears and turn our backs on our fellow Americans. Let us never forget the sacrifice of American values in the name of protecting our great country. These are some of the lessons of American history that we should never, ever forget. f 
HONORING ELIE WIESEL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act, which I had the privilege of introducing in the House last week, with 27 cosponsors. Named after the courageous Nobel laureate, Elie Wiesel, this legislation honors the legacy of his life’s work to expose evil around the world. Mr. Wiesel was just 15 years old when the Nazis deported him and his family to Auschwitz. Rising from literal ashes, he became a writer and spent his life defending the persecuted across the globe. He died nearly 1 year ago, but his passion for victims of injustice lives on. Elie Wiesel believed that from the Holocaust to South Sudan, from Burma to Syria, the world has witnessed far too many genocides and mass atrocity crimes. The true horror is that most of these devastating crises are, indeed, preventable. My heart aches for those whose lives are being torn apart, and the fact that over 65 million people are currently fleeing preventable crises makes clear that the U.S. Government must improve its response to these conflicts. Genocide and atrocity crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing, include 
shocking acts of violence perpetrated by governments and nonstate actors, resulting in the murders of millions of civilians across the globe. The Elie Wiesel Act establishes that the official policy of the United States is to regard the prevention of genocide and atrocity crimes as a core national security interest and moral responsibility. The legislation would establish an interagency mass atrocities task force to strengthen the U.S. Government’s prevention and response efforts. The legislation encourages the Director of National Intelligence to include a review of countries at risk of genocide and mass atrocity crimes in his or her annual report to Congress. The bill also authorizes training for U.S. Foreign Service Officers on early signs of atrocities and transitional justice measures to ensure that America’s diplomats know how to respond to conflict on the ground. Lastly, the legislation authorizes the Complex Crisis Fund to support programs to prevent emerging or unforeseen crises overseas. These tools will empower the United States to strengthen protection efforts and protect the innocent. By supporting civil society, enhancing cooperation among ethnic and religious groups, promoting accountability, and holding murderers accountable, America can promote global stability and fundamental human rights. This time, when America says ‘‘never again,’’ our actions will reinforce our platitudes. 
CARIBBEAN AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) for 5 minutes. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I only have 5 minutes to do justice to a great people, and it is with great honor that I rise today to speak on issues impacting the Caribbean and the contributions of the people of Caribbean heritage to the American fabric. On June 6, 2006, President George Bush signed a proclamation that was ushered through this House by Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, H. Con. Res. 71, naming June Caribbean American Heritage Month. June allows us to highlight the many contributions of Caribbean Americans to the United States. The campaign to designate June as National Caribbean American Heritage Month was spearheaded by Dr. Claire Nelson, founder and president of the Institute of Caribbean Studies. Through the commemoration of this month, we hope to ensure that America is reminded that its greatness lies in its diversity, with Caribbean immigrants from Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, sports icon Tim Duncan, and journalist Malcolm Gladwell, who have and continue to shape the American Dream. The Caribbean region was created through violence and trauma, from the exploration and annihilation by Columbus and his Spanish backers on the native people to the French, English, Dutch, Danish, and American use of African, Indian, and others to create income wealth in their nations. The sweat, labor, and king sugar of the Caribbean people have shaped this and other nations. Our rebellion, innovation, and ingenuity, as well as our independent intellectual intensity, have benefited this and other countries. As one of the pillars of American patriotism and democracy, Alexander Hamilton was born in Nevis, and raised and educated on the island of St. Croix, where he learned the theories and financial methods of the English, Danes, as well as the West African counting system that created not just the foundation of our financial system, but our Federalist ideas. During that same time, Caribbean financiers assisted the American Revolution and gave courage through the example of the tremendous victory of the Haitian people over the French, British, and Spanish armies. But the contributions of Caribbean Americans to the making of America didn’t stop with those heroics. The massive migration of Caribbean people to the United States of America, during the early 20th century, gave us another opportunity to make our impact upon the liberation process that was taking place in this country through politics and the arts. Who doesn’t know Hubert Harrison and Edward Wilmot Blyden, intellectuals of the Harlem Renaissance? Marcus Garvey, Cicely Tyson, Malcolm X, and Harry Belafonte are all of Caribbean heritage and have personified the enormous dignity, revolutionary spirit, and unyielding intellectual gravitas and sense of self worth that hallmarks Caribbean people and has supported the African diaspora pride during times when those attributes would be desired to be denied by others in this country. We continue to contribute to this country in many ways. Secretary of State Colin Powell is of Jamaican heritage; Attorney General Eric Holder, Barbados; Senator K AMALA HARRIS , Jamaica; and former Governor David Paterson’s family is from Grenada. We see many of them in great places. As a result, we all have families and friends who have emigrated to the north and contribute to the social, political, educational, and economic prosperity of the United States. Who doesn’t know Beyonce, who is of Bahamian background, who was named by Forbes as the most powerful celebrity? We have Gwen Ifill from Barbados; and Dr. Patricia Era Bath of Trinidad, who invented the Laserphaco Probe for cataract treatment. She is the first Black woman doctor to receive a medical patent. We have Romany Malco of Trinidad, an actor and comedian; Dr. Marcia Roye, who has done research in HIV/ AIDS and infectious diseases; as well as Camille Wardrop Alleyne of Trinidad, who works for NASA and the Department of Defense working on low Earth orbit. This list does not scratch the surface of those making their mark in the United States. There are so many others that I cannot and do not have the time to highlight. During this month, we have tried to make others aware of the contributions that the Caribbean has. It is not just the contributions we have made, but the commitment that this country should have to its nearest neighbor, the Caribbean. The Caribbean and the United States have shared a long and prolific history together. The United States is the largest economic partner of the Caribbean; and the Caribbean, that small region, accounts for the third largest receiver of American goods. The United States needs to act as a buffer to the increased influence of China and Venezuela in the Caribbean through economic projects the U.S. can continue. As a Delegate representing the only district in the Englishspeaking Caribbean, I am committed to working with the Caribbean community. To those young Caribbean people, I see you. Be strong and of good courage. We are a small people, yet mighty in spirit. f 
WEALTHCARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I love my country and because I refuse to support the Senate ‘‘wealthcare’’ bill. It is not healthcare, but ‘‘wealthcare.’’ It is a ‘‘wealthcare’’ bill because it will cut more than a trillion dollars from healthcare. In so doing, it will transfer approximately $238 billion to highincome earners. It is a ‘‘wealthcare’’ bill. It will rob the poor, who need healthcare, to reward the rich with ‘‘wealthcare.’’ I refuse to support it. I refuse to participate in the concentration of wealth that has taken place. Currently, according to Oxfam, eight people own as much wealth as half the world. This was as of January, 2017. There are eight people with as much wealth as half the world. Mr. Speaker, Big Business and the super rich are fueling inequality not only in this country, but around the world. They do so by dodging taxes. They don’t pay their fair share of taxes. They do so by driving down wages. Many people assume that the country cannot afford healthcare because the people that we live in and around don’t have what the super rich have. My friends, America is not a poor country. The wealth is just concentrated at 
the top. Those who are at the bottom and in between believe that the country can afford things that it can’t. This is all about the concentration of wealth. They are using their power to influence politics. You can’t speak truth to power if you are afraid of the big banks. You can’t speak truth to power if you are afraid of the Big Oil companies. You can’t speak truth to power if you are afraid of the big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies. If you are going to speak truth to power, you have got to stand up to the people who are driving this country into a Third World position. I refuse to participate in it. Mr. Speaker, currently, 1 in 10 on the planet are living off of $2 a day. In this country, millions are going to go without proper healthcare, if the Senate ‘‘wealthcare’’ bill passes. They will go without proper healthcare, while millions in bonuses are going to be accorded those who are with insurance companies and receiving a part of the ‘‘wealthcare’’ transfer. Mr. Speaker, in this country, the top 10 percent hold 76 percent of the wealth. In the United States of America, the top 10 percent hold 76 percent of the wealth. They are able to get away with it because they convinced all of us that one day we might hit the lottery and be in the same position as they are and control the world. Well, my friends, if you don’t hit the lottery and you have to continue your life, you ought to have decent healthcare in the richest country in the world. b1045 You ought to have the best healthcare that we can provide, in the richest country in the world. We are not a Third World country, and I will not participate in this transfer of wealth that is taking place so that those who are wealthy can do more with more. It seems that we believe that if you are poor, you can do more with less. But if you are wealthy, you need more to do more. This is a shameful, sinful circumstance that we find ourselves in. As for the Senate ‘‘wealthcare’’ bill, it is a piece of trash, and it ought to be thrown on the ash heap of history. No one who believes that people are equal and deserve good healthcare can, in good conscience, vote for that bill. I am glad they pulled it, but I hope that they will improve it to the extent that I will be able to vote for it. But if they do not, I say to you without question, reservation, hesitation, or equivocation, I will not support that transfer of wealth, that bill that would concentrate wealth, and I won’t support the tax bill that will concentrate wealth, if there is one. This has got to stop. This inequality of wealth has got to change. We have got to turn it around. Let’s do so by providing good healthcare and not ‘‘wealthcare.’’ THE HEALTHCARE DEBATE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN) for 5 minutes. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the healthcare debate that we are having here in the United States. We had a bill come out of the House of Representatives. We have a working bill that has just come out of the back room in the United States Senate. I think it is important for us, Mr. Speaker, to get some clarity on where each party stands on this issue. When the Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act, we had some clear goals. We had some clear objectives, back in 2008, 2009, 2010. Our goal and goals as a party were simple: we wanted to expand access to healthcare. We wanted to make sure, in the wealthiest country that God has ever created, that every citizen, wherever you lived, urban, rural, suburban, you would have access to affordable healthcare. We wanted to make sure that the insurance companies wouldn’t knock you off the rolls or charge you a lot of money to get a plan, that when you got sick and you went in to cash in the plan and get some coverage, they said: Oh, we don’t cover that. We wanted to make sure that didn’t happen. We wanted to make sure that if your kid had cancer or if you had cancer and the healthcare bills started ratcheting up pretty quickly, that the insurance company couldn’t come in and say: Sorry. This is a tragic situation for you and your family, but you just hit your lifetime cap, so we can’t cover anything else. You have to go to the Ronald McDonald House, and you have got to go do a fish fry at the local union hall to try to get enough money together to try to pay your healthcare bills, in the wealthiest country God has ever created. That is unacceptable here in the United States. We were trying to cover more people. You know what? We paid the political price for it, but sign me up. I think of my friends John Boccieri and Steve Driehaus, former Members of Congress. They gave up their seats in this Chamber to make sure that American citizens had healthcare. The Democrats went into the minority since 2010, primarily because the Republican Party used this issue to bludgeon the Democrats. They demagogued the issue. Repeal and replace. Seven years, no plan. Nothing. And now we have got two bills—one from the House, one from the Senate. Both bills, neutral analysts, the Congressional Budget Office says 22 million Americans will lose their healthcare. Fifteen million will lose it in the next year. If you are between 50 and 64 years old, you are probably going to lose your insurance. If you are a 60yearold person in Ohio, you are going to pay $4,000 more a year. We get off this recent Presidential campaign where we heard a candidate: We are going to expand Medicare. We are going to expand Medicaid. It is going to be beautiful. Everyone is going to be able to afford insurance. I am not inhumane, is what one person said, one candidate said. But the realities, Mr. Speaker, are much different, because in the wealthiest country God has ever created, we have a political party that is trying to throw 22 million people off of their healthcare. We need to get some clarity. We are trying to cover people. I am not trying to be judgmental, but I am just saying the Congressional Budget Office is saying, in both bills, 22 million people are going to lose their healthcare. Democrats, in order to implement our bill, we asked the wealthiest in the country to pay a little bit more. With that revenue, we expanded the Medicaid program for people who were working. If you made less than $90,000 a year, they got a little bit of that money to help them pay for health insurance so they had more money in their pocket so they could go out and not only take care of their families, but be able to spend and help boost the economy. That is what we wanted to do. That is what we did. Republicans cut taxes for the wealthy and cut the program by $700 billion. Clear differences, Mr. Speaker. We need to knock down both of these bills and start all over. We need to fix the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend Dr. Howard Siplin, Beulah Missionary Baptist Church, Coconut Grove, Florida, offered the following prayer: Lord God, almighty giver of all good gifts and authority, I stand humbly before You today to pray for the sins of this country, to ask for Your forgiveness, and to express our gratitude to You for this great country which we live in during these difficult times. Father, I pray for the success and healing of all who labor here in the House of Representatives working together to use their influence and opportunities to change the world and make it better. Heavenly Father, bless all our leaders of this great Nation as they face the ongoing challenges, give them the 
right spirit to do the right thing for the needs of all the people. Father, keep us all in the hollow of Your hand, we give You honor and glory now and forever. In Jesus’ name, we pray. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. STEWART led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING REVEREND DR. HOWARD SIPLIN The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WILSON ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to welcome the esteemed Reverend Dr. Howard Siplin to the House floor as our guest chaplain. Reverend Dr. Siplin was my classmate from first grade to twelfth grade in MiamiDade County Public Schools. Reverend Siplin is the senior pastor of Beulah Missionary Baptist Church located in Coconut Grove, Florida. Before joining the ministry, Reverend Siplin proudly served in law enforcement. He is a graduate of the MiamiDade Police Academy who made history by earning the distinction of becoming the first African American to serve as president of the Fraternal Order of Police. Three years ago, after joining Beulah Missionary Baptist Church, Reverend Siplin was ordained a deacon and later became chairman of the church’s deacon ministry. He was called to preach in the year 2000 and, in August 2003, was ordained and installed to serve as the church’s pastor. Under his leadership, Beulah Missionary Baptist has helped the surrounding community confront and combat various challenges. He also has used his experience in law enforcement to help forge and strengthen bonds between residents and local police. Reverend Siplin has dedicated himself to educating members of the Beulah Missionary Baptist Church community to live spiritual lives so that they can be productive citizens. He holds a bachelor’s and master’s of ministry degree from the Jacksonville Baptist Theological Seminary. In 2014, the seminary awarded him an honorary doctorate degree. Reverend Siplin is married to the former Zelma Ferguson who is with him here today. Her father, the late Reverend E. R. Ferguson, founded Beulah Missionary Baptist Church in 1954. They are the proud parents of 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 2 great grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone to join me in thanking Reverend Siplin for leading today’s opening prayer and to thank him for his outstanding service to the south Florida community. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the tremendous amount of growth in North Carolina, specifically in and around the Second Congressional District. According to the Census Bureau, North Carolina’s population has increased 6.4 percent since 2010. That number increases to over 16 percent for just Wake County which encompasses about half of the Second Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that North Carolina is a fantastic place to live and work, especially for young people wanting to raise a family. In fact, Fortune magazine recently surveyed tens of thousands of millennials nationally about the best places to work, and the results speak for themselves. Two of the top 10 businesses in the United States call Wake County home. SAS, a global analytics software firm, and KimleyHorn, a provider of professional services, placed at number two and number eight on the list respectively. That is great news for the future of North Carolina. 
COMMENDING THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA’S FIRST RESPONDERS (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the city of Alexandria’s first responders, the first to the scene of the shooting at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in my district in Alexandria, Virginia. Two weeks ago today, Wednesday, June 14, at 7 a.m., a man fired scores of shots at the Members of Congress who were practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game. The shooting wounded U.S. Representative and House Majority Whip STEVE SCALISE , Capitol Police Officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner, congressional staffer Zack Barth, and former congressional staffer Matt Mika. The timely response of Alexandria’s first responders almost certainly saved lives. Alexandria Police Officers Nicole Battaglia, Alexander Jensen, and Kevin Jobe arrived within minutes of the 9/11 call. Officer Battaglia came under fire upon arriving at the scene and immediately engaged the shooter. Her actions diverted the shooter’s attention, allowing the other responding officers to neutralize him. Medical care provided by the members of the Alexandria Fire Department, including Fiona Apple and Richard Krimmer, ensured these senseless acts of violence did not become a multiplefatality event. I am honored to commend these valiant individuals for their selfless service. I thank them for saving the lives of the victims and potential victims of this evil, mindless gun violence, and also for their daily positive impact on the extraordinary community of Del Ray and the exceptional city of Alexandria. 
HONORING MISS NORTH CAROLINA (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Miss Greater Sampson County, Victoria Huggins, who won the 80th Miss North Carolina Scholarship Pageant this past weekend and will go on to represent our great State in the Miss America pageant this fall. During the competition, Victoria also won first place in the Quality of Life Award which honors her dedication and work on her community service platforms. A graduate of the University of North Carolina at Pembroke and a native of St. Pauls, Victoria is a member of the Carolina in the Morning team with the NBC affiliate WECT in Wilmington, North Carolina. During her tenure as Miss North Carolina, Victoria will focus on her work advocating for Alzheimer’s disease awareness. On behalf of southeastern North Carolina, congratulations, Victoria. We wish you the best of luck as you represent our great State over the next year, compete in the Miss America pageant, and continue to enrich the lives of others. f 
THE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, with the Congressional Budget Office reporting that 22 million people would lose healthcare coverage and premiums for those who keep their coverage increasing by more than 20 percent next year, it is not surprising that the Republican Senate bill was pulled due to a pervasive lack of interest and support. Hit hardest under the pulled Senate bill were lowand middleincome Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 and people with preexisting diseases like cancer and diabetes. The time has come for this Congress to use the leverage of a massive purchaser of healthcare—the Federal Government—and authorize a Medicare buyin for Americans between the ages of 50 and 64. With the leverage of 60 millionplus beneficiaries and low administrative costs, a Medicare buyin option for the 50 to 64 population will drive down costs and drive up the quality of healthcare. We have an obligation to the American people. 
HONORING REPRESENTATIVE CHAFFETZ (Mr. STEWART asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I stand today to honor my good friend, JASON  CHAFFETZ , as he prepares to leave the House tomorrow. On the day that I was first elected, the very first phone call I got was a number I didn’t recognize. I picked it up, and it was Jason. He was the first person to call and congratulate me. He has become a close friend ever since. But he has become more than a friend. He is a person who I trust. I go to him often for advice. I think he has the best political mind in all of Utah, and I am going to miss that. I also appreciate his honesty and his integrity. Leaders take hits—we understand that—and Jason has taken his share of arrows by those who may not agree with his positions. But no one has ever questioned his honesty or his integrity. There is a great old movie called ‘‘Grumpy Old Men.’’ Jason will never be a star in that movie because he is one of the most optimistic, friendly, and positive people that I know. He always has a smile on his face. So for those reasons, Jason, we are going to miss you. On behalf of all Utahns, I thank him for his service. On behalf of millions of Americans throughout the country, we wish him Godspeed in his adventures ahead. f 
b1215 PULL THE PLUG ON TRUMPCARE (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the Senate has postponed a vote on their TrumpCare bill, which would have deprived 22 million Americans of health coverage. The truly vicious nature of this bill is most clear when it comes to Medicaid. Are you a working family relying on Medicaid for longterm care of an aging grandparent? Well, with TrumpCare, you will pay more out of pocket. For a lowincome working mom who insures her kids through Medicaid, TrumpCare takes dead aim at you. How about a person with a disability? TrumpCare means potentially losing coverage. Why did the Republicans make these cuts? To give billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and corporations. The President says the Housepassed bill is ‘‘mean.’’ It is. So is the Senate coldhearted proposal. A delay on this vote is not enough. Congress needs to pull the plug on TrumpCare, not the American people. Then we can work together on real, bipartisan healthcare legislation aimed at strengthening the system, not harming the most vulnerable among us. 
TRIBUTE TO FIRE CONTROLMAN 1ST CLASS GARY L. REHM, JR. (Mr. JORDAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a courageous career Navy man, Fire Controlman 1st Class Gary L. Rehm, Jr., who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of his fellow Americans. Gary was born and raised in Elyria, in the Fourth District of Ohio. He followed in his grandfather’s footsteps, joining the Navy straight out of high school and serving nearly 20 years, including a deployment to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Gary was on the USS Fitzgerald when it was struck by a container ship off the coast of Japan on June 17. Amid the chaos, Gary jumped into action, battling the raging water that flooded one of the ship’s berthing compartments, risking his own life to bring his shipmates to safety. The sailors who admire him so much might use words like ‘‘valiant,’’ ‘‘heroic,’’ and ‘‘noble’’ to describe Gary’s actions that day, but the words he would probably use to describe himself are found in the Navy’s motto: ‘‘Not for Self but for Country.’’ 
Gary is survived by a loving family, including his wife, Erin; his sister, Jessica; his niece, Margaret Neal; and his parents, Gary and Anita. For his profound sacrifice, this Nation owes Gary L. Rehm, Jr., and his family a tremendous debt of gratitude. He will be greatly missed, but the strength of his character, his selflessness, and the courage he demonstrated through his service will live on forever. 
BILL THREATENS OHIOANS (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today, Vice President PENCE is expected to visit northeast Ohio for an appearance at a manufacturing firm. He will discuss the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and subsequently rip away healthcare for millions upon millions of Americans, as well as quadruple its cost to millions and millions more elderly. Ohioans should know that the bill the GOP is trying to ramrod through Congress would threaten nearly 1 million Ohioans who gained coverage over the last few years through the Affordable Care Act. Further, seniors would see their insurance premiums rise by four to five times as much, with nothing being done to lower their cost of medicine. Why is this administration making things worse for Ohio? We need to maintain Medicaid for the treatment of those Americans who are sick, suffering, in nursing homes, those who are mentally ill, and those who are suffering from terminal illness. The PenceTrump doctrine will hurt them all. I hope the Vice President won’t mislead our people about how many Ohioans will lose coverage. In fact, is the Vice President aware healthcare jobs help drive our economy in Ohio. The TrumpCare bill, which is really a tax break for millionaires, will cause an Ohio job loss of over 80,000 healthcare workers over the next 5 years. I urge the Vice President to meet with officials at Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth, or the Sisters of Charity and hear what they have to say about the GOP’s antilife bill. 
PROVIDENCE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CELEBRATES 250TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Charlotte’s Providence Presbyterian Church and in celebration of their 250th anniversary. Founded by Ulster Scots in 1767, the church was named ‘‘Providence’’ to express the founders’ firm trust in the faithfulness of God to work all things for His purpose. Members of Providence Presbyterian were part of the combative North Carolina militia, the Hornet’s Nest, which courageously opposed Lord Cornwallis during the Revolutionary War. For over 140 years, the church sponsored all schools in the community and, in the late 1850s, established Providence Female Academy, which was one of the few schools for women in the South. The church remains committed to service today. Part of the 250th anniversary celebration included making 250 dresses for young girls in Africa. Their motto is ‘‘Rooted in Christ, growing in the Spirit.’’ To Pastor Walt McCanless and the entire congregation, congratulations, and God bless this wonderful community of believers. f 
TORT REFORM (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, today my colleagues will vote on H.R. 1215, the socalled Protecting Access to Care Act. Disguised as a step toward healthcare affordability, in reality, this legislation tramples on the legal rights of Americans harmed in healthcare settings. This bill would devastate the catastrophically injured by capping noneconomic damages at $250,000, a cap that applies even for loss of limb, permanent disability, or death of a child or spouse. These caps also apply to lawsuits that include accusations of reckless misconduct or violent crimes like assault or rape. This bill further erodes the right to trial by jury by imposing a 3year statute of limitations, which is shorter than most State laws. Legal remedies often stand as the test of the last refuge of justice for the injured and aggrieved, regardless of wealth or influence. Powerful interests have many tools at their disposal to stack the deck against vulnerable populations. But the goal of the American court system at its purest is to provide equal consideration in the eyes of the law. As a nation, our responsibility is to work towards that ideal, not undermine it. H.R. 1215 is a direct affront to this idea, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
REMEMBERING GRANDMA EDNA (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, June 28, 1911, the day my dear grandmother, Edna Yoder, was born, has been a special day in my life. Each year, for the last 6 years, I have come to the floor to wish her a happy birthday. Last year, she celebrated her 105th birthday. Sadly, today would have been her 106th, but Grandma Edna passed away recently, and I miss her terribly. She was a sweet, loving, and strong grandmother. She had an infectious laugh, an enormous love of family, and a deep belief in her faith. She was a symbol of everything that was great about America’s Greatest Generation. She was also a true example of what makes America a strong and vibrant nation: working tirelessly every day on the farm, milking cows at dawn, and bringing in the wheat harvest in the hot Kansas sun. I like to say she had a front row seat on the journey that was the great American century. Mr. Speaker, today, I want Grandma to know that we love her, we miss her, and we know that she is at peace with the Lord in Heaven. f 
GOP HEALTHCARE BILL (Miss RICE of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, people in my district and in districts all across the country have been making it clear that they don’t want millions of Americans to become uninsured just to cut taxes for the rich. They don’t want Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act. What they want is for Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it better: to keep expanding coverage, reducing costs, and improving care. Now that the Senate has delayed a vote on the BCRA, we have yet another opportunity to do just that. I urge my Republican colleagues to move past repeal and replace once and for all. Democrats are ready to work with you. So let’s seize this opportunity and start solving problems for the people we serve. 
STREAMLINING PERMITTING PROCESS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this week, in the Natural Resources Committee, we passed my bill, H.R. 289, the Guides and Outfitters Act, called the GO Act. It will help people be able to access public lands, national parks, U.S. Forest Service land, and BLM land for recreational activities without the litany and long wait of having to get permits. This will streamline that process. A couple of aspects include getting all the different agencies to work together to have a onestop permitting process and shorten the length of time it takes to get these permits so that people can have events that are compatible with the use of these public lands and enjoy them. Indeed, no one is trying to hurt the environment, and we don’t need a 6month study every time somebody wants to have a bikefest or a jog through their public lands. 
We think the GO Act will be a very important, helpful tool, especially during the summertime, when people like to get outdoors and enjoy their public lands. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3003, NO SANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 414 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on House Resolution 414, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to bring this rule forward on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit. Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from my fellow Judiciary Committee members Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana and Ms. L OFGREN  of California. H.R. 3003 received consideration by the Judiciary Committee as part of a larger bill, the Michael Davis, Jr. and Danny Oliver in Honor of State and Local Law Enforcement Act. That legislation was marked up and ordered reported by the Judiciary Committee on May 24. As a cosponsor and strong advocate of the DavisOliver Act, I supported the passage of legislation before the full House. Today we have the opportunity to move an important piece of that bill forward and to strengthen our policies against jurisdictions that flout America’s laws. Mr. Speaker, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is just simply common sense. John Adams said that we are a government of laws, not of men. As we approach the Fourth of July week, we recognize that America’s foundation is that of the rule of law. Yet too often we have seen local jurisdictions ignore Federal immigration law and declare themselves sanctuary cities, as though their actions have no consequences for their lawabiding neighbors. The reality, however, is that the localities that refuse to enforce Federal immigration law undermine public safety and break the democratic contract. Mr. Speaker, the sanctuary cities do not act in a vacuum. They endanger lives and set dangerous precedent. b1230 To many people, it would seem obvious that local and State law enforcement should comply with Federal immigration laws and cooperate with its fair enforcement by communicating openly with Federal officials. It would also seem clear that jurisdictions that ignore these laws should forfeit the Federal funds set aside to support compliance with those same laws. Despite this, sanctuary cities oppose Federal immigration officials routinely. These men and women find themselves handicapped by local officials implementing obstructionist policies. In light of this, Mr. Speaker, I believe we need to better protect our communities by ensuring our laws are followed. H.R. 3003 takes steps do that. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE , Congressman KING, and Congressman BIGGS for their work on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. These Members are colleagues of mine on the Judiciary Committee, and they recognize the need to respond to the continuing problem of sanctuary cities with resolve, with confidence that Federal immigration laws safeguard every American community and apply equally to every American community. The underlying bill provided for by this rule also includes legislation offered by Mr. KING—Sarah’s and Grant’s Law. Sarah’s and Grant’s Law is named after two individuals, Sarah Root and Grant Ronnebeck, who were tragically killed by unlawful immigrants. The unlawful immigrants were released and remain at large, and the Root and Ronnebeck families were left to grieve unspeakable losses while the lawlessness continues. It is past time for us to take action to combat dangerous sanctuary policies. We are a nation of laws and we need to act like it. While there is no uniform definition of sanctuary cities, and no comprehensive or official list of these jurisdictions, we have, regrettably, become all too familiar with them. Socalled sanctuary cities are those jurisdictions that obstruct immigration enforcement through noncompliance with detainers. They construct unreasonable hurdles to compliance and create barriers to communication between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local personnel. We understand that ICE has a job to do and that its officers took oaths to uphold those duties. Opponents will claim that this bill is unnecessary because ICE has the jurisdiction it needs. The truth is, sanctuary policies make the ICE agents’ jobs more difficult, more dangerous, and endanger communities. While the previous administration frequently flouted immigration laws and, for far too long, took a rain check on holding sanctuary cities accountable, even former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson agreed that sanctuary cities shouldn’t simply be allowed to decline to cooperate with Federal Government authorities. In fact, he said in 2015 that it is ‘‘not acceptable to have no policy of cooperation with immigration enforcement.’’ Mr. Speaker, faithfulness to the law isn’t like being offered a cup of coffee. You can’t look at the Federal statutes and say: You know, no thanks, but I appreciate you offering. H.R. 3003 confirms that this option is not on the table. While I agree with former Secretary Johnson that we must have a policy of cooperation, the policies of the former administration too frequently didn’t indicate a commitment to that goal. In fact, State and local jurisdictions ignored more than 12,000 Federal detainer requests in 2014. Now is the time for action. Thankfully, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and ICE to ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions are ineligible for Federal grants and are subject to enforcement actions. The President also charged these agencies with reporting on jurisdictions that have refused to comply with detainers to hold criminal aliens. The first week this report was issued, it showed 206 known instances in which local personnel declined ICE detainers and released criminal aliens. These aliens reentered the communities after they had committed crimes such as assault, aggravated assault or battery, driving under the influence, or domestic violence abuses. The reports indicate that we have work to do, but it helps us by identifying jurisdictions where personnel are 
thwarting Federal law. It throws into relief the glaring problem of sanctuary cities and provides information that law enforcement and lawmakers can use as we assess the problem and develop meaningful solutions. Mr. Speaker, I was in the Georgia State House when we took action there to address the issue of sanctuary cities. In 2009, we in Georgia outlawed sanctuary cities in our State. Last year, the legislature went further by requiring local governments to certify their cooperation with immigration officials in order to receive State funds. Today we have a chance to take a step in a positive direction on the Federal level. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act prohibits States and localities from implementing policies that restrict law enforcement agencies from cooperating with immigration laws and officials. It gives teeth to that restriction by tying eligibility for certain Department of Justice and Homeland Security grants to State and local compliance with existing immigration laws. The bill requires that there will be probable cause before ICE can issue a detainer, and focuses on grant programs reasonably related to the scope of the bill. Importantly, this bill also calls for aliens to be detained if the alien is engaged in a crime that caused death or serious injury to another person. Had this provision been law at the time, it could have helped prevent what happened in the heartbreaking death of Sarah Root, where an alien who caused her death was freed on bond and remains at large. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act also takes the commonsense step of allowing DHS to withhold aliens rather than transferring them to sanctuary jurisdictions, even if the jurisdiction has a warrant. It simply doesn’t make sense for DHS to transfer aliens who are removable under the law to jurisdictions that are looking for opportunities to let them go. Mr. Speaker, I cannot talk about holding sanctuary cities accountable by strengthening our laws without mentioning the work of Chairman JOHN CULBERSON . In 2016, Chairman CULBERSON successfully convinced the Department of Justice to update guidelines in order to disqualify sanctuary cities from receiving DOJ grant money should they be found in violation of title 8 U.S. Code, section 1373. Attorney General Sessions has reiterated that Federal law enforcement grants are contingent on compliance with existing law, and that the DOJ will deny fiscal year 2017 grant funds to jurisdictions that have refused to share information regarding illegal aliens in their custody. Chairman CULBERSON ’s efforts made clear that State and local law enforcement agencies are expected to work with Federal law enforcement agencies on immigration matters. Through his diligent work, meaningful steps have been taken to restore accountability. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act builds on these efforts and ensures that jurisdictions comply with the detainers while strengthening our law to ensure that aliens who have been committing crimes such as drunk driving are detained pending their removal. H.R. 3003 permits the Secretary of DHS to issue a detainer for any individual arrested for violation of a criminal or motor vehicle law upon probable cause that an individual is an inadmissible or deportable alien. In this critically important step, the bill grants immunity to State and local entities for compliance with any detainer. Jurisdictions that want to act in good faith and follow the law should be able to cooperate without being held liable for their compliance. The protections provided in this bill are a major step forward to effective enforcement. Finally, this bill gives victims and their families a private right of action against a State and local government whose noncompliance and release of an alien results in a murder, rape, or serious injury of the victim. This measure, were it law, would have allowed Kate Steinle’s family to sue after her tragic murder at the hands of a criminal and unlawful immigrant. Sanctuary cities and jurisdictions ignore the law. They do it at the expense of the American people. Our citizens surely deserve better. They deserve to live in communities that don’t let dangerous criminals back out into the streets. They deserve to see the law upheld rather than ignored. Lawabiding citizens deserve to see individuals who break our laws—not only by entering and residing in our country illegally, but by committing crimes once here—to be removed. This rule provides for the consideration of legislation to strengthen the rule of law and to protect our neighbors and communities. It demands that jurisdictions comply with our Nation’s immigration laws and enforcement or face penalties. Today we can take action to turn off the spigot of Federal funds to those jurisdictions that obstruct ICE efforts at the expense of Americans. We demonstrate that Members of this House will not sit idly by while sanctuary cities continue flouting the laws of our land with impunity. We strengthen our detainer policy, enable ICE to do its job, and, at the same time, help protect our communities. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this closed rule, and in strong opposition to the underlying bill, H.R. 3003. Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider its 37th closed rule for the year, and tomorrow it will take up number 38. My Republican friends are breaking all kinds of records here. While I often wonder just why the Republican leadership is so afraid of open debate in the United States House of Representatives, I do recognize that it goes right along with the Republican majority’s complete rejection of regular order. The House of Representatives, I am sad to say, has ceased being a deliberative body where important issues are debated freely. The Republican leadership has shut this place down, and this is yet another example of it. Look up the history of the bill the House will debate later today or tomorrow, H.R. 3003, the socalled No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. It was introduced on June 22. That was last Thursday. Like its 2015 predecessor, it has had no hearings, no markup, no input from local law enforcement, no regular order. No one had a chance to testify about this bill. Not the U.S. Conference of Mayors that includes the mayors of over 1,000 cities and towns, Democrat and Republican alike, who represent over 150 million people. Not the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic Charities, Church World Service, and religious and faith leaders from all across the land. Not the National Fraternal Order of Police, the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, or the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence. Not the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the YWCA, or hundreds of national civil rights, human rights, labor, immigration, and humanitarian organizations. Mr. Speaker, on a bill that would affect hundreds of cities and towns and counties across America, why wouldn’t we want to hear the views of these important law enforcement, State and local government, religious, civil society, and victims’ organizations? The answer is simple, Mr. Speaker. Because they all oppose this legislation. All of them. It is much easier for Republicans to close down the process and steamroll this terrible bill through Congress than to actually get feedback from the American people and the leaders charged with keeping them safe. If you are going to pass a bill that has so much public opposition, I guess it makes sense to do it quickly and with as little debate as possible. Welcome to the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, where the voices of the American people are shut out as Republicans continue to ram through their radical agenda. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3003 does nothing to advance cooperation between local law enforcement with the Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
Cooperation between local and Federal agencies to apprehend, try, and punish serious criminal offenders, and in the case of foreign nationals, to imprison and then deport them, has always been a high priority. These are matters of national security. But instead of continuing to foster cooperation and strengthen this priority, this bill chooses to blackmail, coerce, and penalize local law enforcement agencies and demand that they potentially violate the Constitution of the United States, in particular the Fourth Amendment, the 10th Amendment, and the 14th amendment. I wish my Republican friends were as faithful to the rights enshrined in these amendments of the Bill of Rights as they are to the Second Amendment, but then that is a whole other debate. And let’s think about this for a minute. What are they proposing to do? For communities and local law enforcement that believe that doing what this bill asks them to do would make it more difficult for them to do local policing, and would make it more difficult for them to have the trust of members in their community to report crimes. What my Republican friends propose to do is take away important Federal funding to help keep these communities safe. What are we talking about here? I think it is important for people to understand this. Programs like the COPS programs, the Community Oriented Policing Services; the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program; the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program; and national security programs, those things would be taken away from local communities. It doesn’t make any sense. For example, the Bynre JAG is a major source of criminal justice funding for local law enforcement and provided $275 million in fiscal year 2016 for prevention and education programs, drug treatment and enforcement, crime victim and witness initiatives, and other communitybased programs. Other funding programs and grants that are threatened under this bill are used to address sexual assault, gang violence, and trafficking such as the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, the Violent Gang and Gun Crime Reduction Program, and the Reach and Evaluation on Trafficking in Persons program. Maybe nobody read what this bill does before they brought it to the floor. I just don’t understand the logic of basically trying to blackmail communities by taking away important funding that is designed to protect the citizens of various communities across this country. Mr. Speaker, this socalled sanctuary cities bill, as I mentioned, threatens to strip local jurisdictions of Federal grants and funding. It specifically targets law enforcement, counterterrorism, and national security grants when they prioritize working with immigrant communities to keep our neighbors and cities and towns safe. b1245 I don’t think Washington knows best all the time, unlike my Republican colleagues. I trust my local police departments on this issue more than I trust my friends on the other side of the aisle. Republicans would rather demonize these cities, towns, and local police agencies and force them to squander scarce local resources on immigration enforcement instead of local policing, making our cities and our communities less safe, not more safe. This is why law enforcement and city governments oppose this bill. It deliberately and cynically undermines their ability to protect their communities, nurture public trust in the police and our legal system, and strengthen public safety. Mr. Speaker, this bill reeks of prejudice. It isn’t meant to solve any problem. It is meant to punish cities that don’t embrace the radical views of the antiimmigrant rightwing of the Republican Party. It is meant to demonize all immigrants as criminals. It is meant to turn our local police into the lackeys of ICE. Mr. Speaker, this House continues to wait and wait and wait for the Republican majority to show some leadership and bring up a comprehensive immigration reform bill. It has been more than 4 years since the Senate passed a strong, bipartisan immigration reform bill, and we are still waiting for House Republicans to step up and act, to actually try to solve a problem rather than continue to divide our country and continue to act in a way that is polarizing. What we need is a way to bring 11 million of our neighbors, friends, colleagues, smallbusiness owners, and hardworking residents out of the shadows. That is what makes America stronger. That is why 9 out of 10 Americans support immigration reform that creates a path to citizenship for the undocumented, according to a March 2017 poll by CNN/ORC. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the article about the poll. 
[From cnn.com, Mar. 17, 2017] CNN/ORC POLL: AMERICANS BREAK WITH TRUMP ON IMMIGRATION POLICY  (By Tal Kopan and Jennifer Agiesta) WASHINGTON (CNN).—Americans disagree with President Donald Trump’s immigration priorities, according to a new CNN/ORC poll, with nearly twothirds of Americans saying they’d like to see a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants rather than deportations. Trump has made tough border security and strict enforcement of US immigration laws a focal point of his campaign and presidency— using some of his first executive orders to pave the way for far more deportations and detentions as well as ordering the construction of a Southern border wall. But a CNN/ORC poll released Friday finds that the public is actually moving in the opposite direction since Trump has won election. Americans are more likely to say that the nation’s top immigration priority should be to allow those in the US illegally to gain legal status—and six in 10 say they are more concerned that deportation efforts will be overzealous than they are that dangerous criminals will be overlooked. All told, 60% say the government’s top priority in dealing with illegal immigration should be developing a plan to allow those in the US illegally who have jobs to become legal residents. In contrast, 26% say developing a plan to stop illegal border crossings should be the top priority and 13% say deportation of those in the US illegally should be the first priority. The number who prioritize legal status for those working in the US illegally is up from 51% who said so last fall. That shift comes across party lines, with Democrats and independents each 10 points more likely and Republicans 8 points more likely to choose a plan for legal status now compared with last fall. While Trump campaigned heavily against ‘‘amnesty’’ for undocumented immigrants, he has avoided rescinding an Obama administration program offering protections and work permits to those who were brought to the US as children, and in a recent meeting with reporters a senior administration official indicated Trump could be open to a compromise that included a path to legalization, if not citizenship, if it came to his desk. Trump told Congress in his joint address last month that he supported the idea of an immigration reform compromise, but offered few details. Offering citizenship to those immigrants who are living in the US illegally but hold a job, speak English and are willing to pay back taxes is immensely popular, with 90% behind such a plan. That’s consistent across party lines, with 96% of Democrats, 89% of independents and 87% of Republicans behind it. The President has described his immigration policies as focused on removing criminals, though critics of his administration say enforcement agencies’ definition of criminal is too expansive and sweeps up people who only broke immigration laws. He has also ordered the creation of offices and reports focused on publicizing victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. Americans say, however, they are more concerned about the effects of deportations than they are about immigrant crimes. Overall, 58% say they’re more concerned that deportation efforts will go too far and result in deportation of people who haven’t committed serious crimes, while 40% say they’re more concerned that those efforts will not go far enough and dangerous criminals will remain in the US. That number is largely driven by Democrats—more than twothirds of Republicans say they are concerned efforts won’t go far enough. As for deportation priorities, seven in 10 say the government should not attempt to deport all immigrants living in the country illegally, up from 66% in the fall. A wide majority, nearly eight in 10, support deporting undocumented immigrants who have committed other crimes, however, an area Trump says is his focus. There has been a small uptick, nevertheless, in the share who say the government shouldn’t be deporting those living in the US illegally who have been convicted of other crimes, from 15% to 19%. Opinions vary by party on both of these questions, though majorities across party lines are on the same side of both arguments. Among Republicans, 55% oppose attempts to deport all people living in the US illegally, below the 86% of Democrats and 71% of independents who feel that way. Considering deportation of those in the country illegally 
who have been convicted of other crimes, 64% of Democrats favor that, below the 79% of independents and 93% of Republicans who say the same. CNN/ORC interviewed 1,025 American adults by phone from March 1 to 4 for the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Results by party have a margin of error of plus or minus 6 points. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, instead of working together to find commonsense solutions to immigration, the Republican leadership offers extreme, deportationonly bills that undermine public safety and hurt our communities. Let them register; let them pay a fine; let them be documented and not fear talking with the police; and let us recognize their many contributions to communities across America. These are our friends, our colleagues, and our neighbors. Our kids go to school together. We shop at the same grocery stores and eat at the same restaurants. We serve together on the PTA and worship together at church. Our country is strongest when we lift up our neighbors. This bill will only drive us apart. Mr. Speaker, this bill is just more of the same old divisive Republican anti immigrant formula. It will sow fear among the immigrant community, regardless of their status; it will tear families apart; it will subvert public trust of local law enforcement and police; and it will undermine the Constitution of the United States. Mr. Speaker, America is better than this. I urge my colleagues to reject this closed rule and to oppose the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again, I respect my friend from Massachusetts a great deal. I am not sure what is subversive to the Constitution in upholding the law. When we deal with this issue, it is about a choice. We can talk about local law enforcement and we can talk about cities that do not want to do this, but they are making the choice here. It is time we hold people accountable for choices. I think it is really interesting that we mentioned the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, which, by the way, was meant to reimburse localities for holding illegal immigrants. If they are not holding them, then why do they need the money to start with? So let’s at least put it in perspective here. I can talk about immigration reform. I believe there is a lot that we can do in that. I agree with the gentleman. However, I disagree in the part here, why don’t we enforce the law that is here? By the way, that is currently the law under both President Obama and President Trump. Under U.S. Code section 1373, in order to get Federal money, they have to comply with this section. This simply builds upon what we have already done. So I think it is a choice here. I think making it out to be anything other than a choice that the localities have made is really trying to subvert the process and discuss another issue. We can do that all we want. That is what ended up, a lot of times, happening in this rule debate. But at the end of the day, this is about simply enforcing the law. I think if you go to places all over the country and you begin to ask them just a simple question and start it off with this, ‘‘Don’t you think we ought to enforce the law?’’ the answer you get over 90 percent of the time is yes. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is clear that the laws aren’t working. That is why we need comprehensive immigration reform, and that is why it is so unfortunate that the Republicans in this House have stalled on that issue. We had bipartisan support a few years ago for comprehensive immigration reform, but people here, for some reason, would rather just demagogue the issue than do something about it. As I said before, I actually trust my local officials, my local police, more than I do my Republican friends who are speaking here today and who spoke in the Rules Committee last night. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter to all of us from the National Fraternal Order of Police, which is strongly opposed to this bill; a letter to all of us from The United States Conference of Mayors, which is strongly opposed to all of this; a letter to all of us from the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, which is strongly opposed to this bill; and a letter to all of us from Cities for Action, which is strongly opposed to this bill. 
NATIONAL  FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE , Washington, DC, June 27, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. KEVIN O. M CCARTHY , Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY P. P ELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. STENY H. H OYER , Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER AND REPRESENTATIVES  MCCARTHY , PELOSI AND HOYER : I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to reiterate the FOP’s opposition to any amendment or piece of legislation that would penalize law enforcement agencies by withholding Federal funding or resources from law enforcement assistance programs in an effort to coerce a policy change at the local level. The House will consider H.R. 3003 on the floor this week and Section 2 of this bill would restrict the hiring program administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (ByrneJAG) programs, as well as programs administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The FOP has been very clear on this issue: we strongly believe that local and State law enforcement agencies should cooperate with their Federal counterparts. That being said, withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies—which have no policymaking role—also hurts public safety efforts. Local police departments answer to local civilian government and it is the local government which enacts statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement officers have no more say in these matters than any other citizen and—with laws like the Hatch Act in place—it can be argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to pick and choose which laws to enforce, and must carry out lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the civilian government that employs them. It is unjust to penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because Congress disagrees with their enforcement priorities with respect to our nation’s immigration laws. The FOP issued a statement in January of this year regarding the approach of the Administration on sanctuary cities as outlined in President Trump’s Executive Order. The President recognized that it is unfair to penalize the law enforcement agencies serving these jurisdictions for the political decisions of local officials. It allows the U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to make an informed decision about the public safety impact without an automatic suspension from Federal grant programs. In Section 2 of H.R. 3003, there is no such discretion and it countermands the Administration’s existing policy. The FOP opposed several bills in the previous Congress, which were outlined in a letter to the Senate leadership, and we will continue to work against proposals that would reduce or withhold funding or resources from any Federal program for local and State law enforcement. If Congress wishes to effect policy changes in these sanctuary cities, it must find another way to do so. On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to urge the House to reject H.R. 3003’s punitive approach and work with law enforcement to find a better way to improve public safety in our communities. Please feel free to contact me or my Senior Advisor Jim Pasco in my Washington office if I can be of any further assistance. Sincerely, CHUCK CANTERBURY , National President. 
THEUNITED STATES  CONFERENCE OF MAYORS , Washington, DC, June 26, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : I write to register the strong opposition of the nation’s mayors to H.R. 3003, a partisan bill that seeks to punish socalled ‘‘sanctuary cities,’’ which is expected to be considered by the full House this week. The U.S. Conference of Mayors represents well over a thousand mayors and nearly 150 million people. Today, we concluded the 85th Annual Meeting of The U.S. Conference of Mayors and adopted policy that reinforces and builds on previous positions we have taken which oppose provisions in this bill. Specifically, the nation’s mayors: urge members of Congress to withdraw legislation that attempts to cut local law enforcement funding necessary to ensure the safety of our communities, indemnify conduct that violates the constitutional rights afforded to both United States citizens and immigrant populations, and further criminalizes immigration and infringes on the rights of immigrant; 
oppose punitive policies that limit local control and discretion, and urge instead that Congress and the Administration pursue immigration enforcement policies that recognize that local law enforcement has limited resources and community trust is critical to local law enforcement and the safety of our communities; oppose federal policies that commandeer local law enforcement or require local UN authorities to violate, or be placed at risk of violating, a person’s Fourth Amendment rights; expend limited resources to act as immigration agents; or otherwise assist federal immigration authorities beyond what is determined by local policy. HR 3003 would do all of these things and more: It would jeopardize public safety by withholding critical public safety funding from jurisdictions that tell their police officers not to ask an individual their immigration status. Many departments have such policies to encourage crime victims and witnesses to report crimes and to build trust with immigrant communities. It would put jurisdictions at risk of violating an individual’s Fourth Amendment rights by establishing probable cause standards for ICE’s issuance of detainers that do not require a judicial determination of probable cause. Numerous federal courts have found that continued detention under an ICE detainer, absent probable cause, would state a claim for a violation of the Fourth Amendment and subject the detaining officer or jurisdiction to civil liability. While it says it would provide immunity to jurisdictions which comply with detainers and hold them harmless in any suits filed against them, they would still be subject to Fourth Amendment challenges. Further compelling and expanding compliance with certain enforcement provisions, such as immigration detainers, and cutting off federal funding to jurisdictions which do not comply with these provisions likely conflict with the Tenth Amendment. H.R. 3003 is a bad bill for our cities and their residents and for our nation. It would jeopardize public safety, preempt local authority, and expose local governments to litigation and potential findings of damages. America’s mayors call on you to do the right thing and vote against H.R. 3003 when it is considered on the floor. The U.S. Conference of Mayors urges you instead to focus on positive legislation that will fix our broken immigration system and make our cities safer. The nation’s mayors pledge to work with you on bipartisan immigration reform legislation that will fix our nation’s broken immigration system. We need to move beyond punitive bills like H.R. 3003 and develop an immigration system that works for our nation, our cities and our people. To make our cities safer we urge you to consider legislation that will help us to fight crime and prevent terrorism. The U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Major Cities Chiefs Association agree that to make the streets of America safe, Congress must act to strengthen bonds between communities and police, expand homeland security grants, invest in mental health and substance abuse services, reduce gun violence, and reform the criminal justice system and strengthen reentry services. Sincerely, MITCHELL J. L ANDRIEU , Mayor of New Orleans, President. 
LAWENFORCEMENT  IMMIGRATION TASKFORCE , June 28, 2017. DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS : As law enforcement leaders dedicated to preserving the safety and security of our communities, we have concerns about legislative proposals that would attempt to impose punitive, ‘‘onesizefitsall’’ policies on state and local law enforcement. Rather than strengthening state and local law enforcement by providing us with the tools to work with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a manner that is responsive to the needs of our communities, these proposals would represent a step backwards. Attempts to defund socalled sanctuary cities regularly sweep too broadly, punishing jurisdictions that engage in wellestablished community policing practices or adhere to federal court decisions that have found federal immigration detainers to violate constitutional protections. We oppose these approaches and urge Congress to work to encourage—rather than compel—law enforcement agency cooperation within our federal system. We believe that law enforcement should not cut corners. Multiple federal courts have questioned the legality and constitutionality of federal immigration detainers that are not accompanied by a criminal warrant signed by a judge. Even though the legality of such immigration holds is doubtful, some have proposed requiring states and localities to enforce them, shielding them from lawsuits. While this approach would reduce potential legal liability faced by some jurisdictions and departments, we are concerned these proposals would still require our agencies and officers carry out federal directives that could violate the U.S. Constitution, which we are sworn to follow. Immigration enforcement is, first and foremost, a federal responsibility. Making our communities safer means better defining roles and improving relationships between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. But in attempting to defund ‘‘sanctuary cities’’ and require state and local law enforcement to carry out the federal government’s immigration enforcement responsibilities, the federal government would be substituting its judgment for the judgment of state and local law enforcement agencies. Local control has been a beneficial approach for law enforcement for decades—having the federal government compel state and local law enforcement to carry out new and sometimes problematic tasks undermines the delicate federal balance and will harm locallybased policing. Rather than requiring state and local law enforcement agencies to engage in additional immigration enforcement activities, Congress should focus on overdue reforms of the broken immigration system to allow state and local law enforcement to focus their resources on true threats—dangerous criminals and criminal organizations. We believe that state and local law enforcement must work together with federal authorities to protect our communities and that we can best serve our communities by leaving the enforcement of immigration laws to the federal government. Threatening the removal of valuable grant funding that contributes to the health and wellbeing of communities across the nation would not make our communities safer and would not fix any part of our broken immigration system. Our immigration problem is a national problem deserving of a national approach, and we continue to recognize that what our broken system truly needs is a permanent legislative solution—broadbased immigration reform. Sincerely, Chief Chris Magnus, Tucson, AZ; Chief Sylvia Moir, Tempe, AZ; Ret. Chief Roberto Villasenor, Tucson, AZ; Chief Charlie Beck, Los Angeles, CA; Ret.

CITIES FOR ACTION , June 28, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMEMBERS OF CONGRESS : Cities for Action (C4A) is a coalition of over 150 mayors and municipal leaders that advocates for policies and programs that promote inclusion of foreignborn residents. Our coalition has a deep commitment to promoting public safety and building trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities. We are writing to you today to urge that you oppose the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003. Cities and counties are united in our opposition to Representative Goodlatte’s bill, which would undermine local public safety efforts. Nearly 600 jurisdictions have a variety of policies that would put them at risk of losing millions of dollars in federal funding for local law enforcement, national security, drug treatment, and crime victim initiatives. These policies were adopted due to constitutional concerns and judgements made on the best use of limited resources. Rather than empowering localities to adopt measures designed to enhance the general welfare of their residents, H.R. 3003 would strip localities of the ability to enact commonsense crime prevention policies that ensure victims of crime will seek protection and report crimes. Among the types of grants that would be at risk are: the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, which addresses the growing number of unsubmitted sexual assault kits in law enforcement custody and aims to provide help for victims; the Violent Gang and Gun Crime Reduction Program, which is designed to create safer neighborhoods through a sustained reduction in gang violence and gun crime; and the Research and Evaluation on Trafficking of Persons, which helps support cities’ efforts to respond to the challenges that human trafficking pose in their jurisdiction. This bill also raises serious concerns by undermining local laws and criminal prosecutions. It would prevent states or localities from establishing laws or policies that 
prohibit or ‘‘in any way’’ restrict compliance with or cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This intrudes into local policies that help foster a relationship of trust between law enforcement officials and immigrants that will, in turn, promote public safety for all our residents. This also raises serious constitutional concerns. The Tenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution limits the federal government’s ability to mandate particular action by states and localities, including in the area of federal immigration law enforcement and investigations. The federal government cannot force states or localities to enact or administer a federal regulatory program, or compel state or local employees to participate in the administration of a federally enacted regulatory scheme. In addition, this bill permits DHS to ignore validly issued state or local criminal warrants, which would prevent jurisdictions from completing their prosecution of criminals. The provisions of this bill undercut local law enforcement and will jeopardize public safety efforts. Local governments have a strong interest in protecting all residents and maintaining public safety. Therefore, we urge you to oppose the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, and ensure it never becomes law. Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter, CITIES FOR ACTION . 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I know my friends think Washington knows best, but I trust my local police more. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ), the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, there is no debating that our immigration system is in need of reform. The system doesn’t meet the needs of our Nation, its businesses, or its families. There are sensible steps we can take to ensure that it works better and that the rules are followed. But rather than work in a bipartisan and toptobottom fashion to fix our broken laws, today we consider a one sided and enforcementonly approach that is rejected by the majority of Americans. This bill would drastically expand and, indeed, compel local involvement with Federal immigration enforcement. Even though the majority often professes its fondness for states’ rights and local governance, the bill actually prohibits States and cities from policing themselves as they think best, including by having community trust policies that disentangle local policing from Federal immigration enforcement. These are policies that have proven to engender trust in law enforcement and drive down crime. The bill prohibits jurisdictions from declining immigration detainer requests, even when compliance would violate binding court orders. In fact, a lot of Federal district courts have found that, when it is time to release an inmate because their sentence has been served, it violates the Fourth Amendment to hold that individual upon a mere request by the Federal Government. If you want that person, the answer is simple: Get a warrant. It is the Fourth Amendment. Indeed, the bill also likely violates the 10th Amendment by commandeering States to engage in Federal enforcement. The bill, as has been mentioned, cuts off critical law enforcement funding, and that is why the Fraternal Order of Police has written its letter in opposition to the bill. Taken together, the provisions of this bill undermine law enforcement’s ability to keep communities safe, hurt victims and witnesses of crimes, and likely violate the U.S. Constitution. It is no surprise this bill is a priority for the Trump administration. Anti immigrant sentiment may have become the hallmark of the Trump administration, but it does not represent the values of our Nation, and, indeed, the majority of Americans strongly oppose President Trump’s agenda. Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to oppose this rule and to oppose the bill. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again, just going on this, immigration is an interesting issue, and we can discuss this. There probably are not a lot of folks that I respect more than the gentlewoman from California, but this is a constitutional issue. Immigration is a national issue. If we are willing to reverse this out and let the States and localities determine immigration, I think we settled that way over 200 years ago. This is where this belongs. So, as we look at this, Washington is not saying it knows best. But on this issue, it is our domain; it is where we are supposed to be. This is our role. We believe, simply, that enforcing the law is what we need here. If the gentleman believes that States ought to have more control in a lot of things that we do, then I think maybe I am getting him closer to agreeing with us on healthcare that we need to reform and replace ObamaCare and let States have a little bit more information in that. But one of the things is that there is no affirmative action on the cities here. I think there is sort of a point to make here. There is no affirmative action on cities or localities to comply with this issue. They are simply, again, as I said earlier, making a choice. If they choose not to work through it the current way, then they are giving up Federal funding. That is their choice. If they choose to do it, they are giving up Federal funding. They are not being forced and coerced. They are simply saying: You actually look at it; you make the choice in how you want to do it; then explain it to your population. If they are agreeing with that, that is your choice. One of the things that often is said here is we trot out letters from associations. And I agree. I respect the National Fraternal Order of Police and mayors. They have a great thing. But they also represent members who are, right now, actually, not in compliance with this, who dislike this law. So, naturally, you would say part of their membership is going to be supportive of them. But, also, growing up in the household of a Georgia State trooper, I also know a few things about law enforcement as well. Law enforcement wants to protect the communities they serve, and they want to enforce the law. What is happening right now is that local law enforcement is deciding how they are going to do this. They are not cooperating with ICE to find a better way to work in their communities. They are simply saying: We made a political choice to do something. Well, Mr. Speaker, I think with the Constitution, this body has the political choice to say: That is your choice; just do it without Federal funds. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The gentleman, my friend, says that this is a constitutional question. We agree that the Constitution is an important document, and it goes to the heart of why we are opposed to the bill that the gentleman is supporting here. The reason why we say that is because we have had Federal courts that have decided in ways in the past that cause great concern that much in this bill may be unconstitutional. Now, that is why we should have had hearings, that radical idea that we keep on bringing up, like hearings where people come and testify. But I guess that is too much to ask. One of the reasons why we are opposed to this is because we are concerned that it may undermine the Constitution, and that is a pretty big deal. I am happy to give the gentleman my copy of the Constitution and references to court cases if he would like to do a little research, but, boy, it would have been nice to have a hearing. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter on behalf of 407 local, State, and national immigrant, civil rights, faithbased, and labor organizations in strong opposition to H.R. 3003. 
JUNE28, 2017. Re Vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, and Kate’s Law, H.R. 3004. U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 407 undersigned local, state, and national immigrant, civil rights, faithbased, and labor organizations, we urge you to oppose the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate’s Law, H.R. 3004, and any similar legislation that jeopardizes public safety, erodes the goodwill forged between local police and its residents, and perpetuates the criminalization and incarceration of immigrants. H.R. 3003 would strip badly needed law enforcement funding for state and local jurisdictions, runs afoul of the Tenth and Fourth Amendment, and unnecessarily expands the government’s detention apparatus. H.R. 3004 unwisely expands the federal government’s 
ability to criminally prosecute immigrants for immigrationbased offenses, excludes critical humanitarian protections for those fleeing violence, and doubles down on the failed experiment of incarceration for immigration violations. Over 600 state and local jurisdictions have policies or ordinances that disentangle their state and local law enforcement agencies from enforcing federal immigration law. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, seeks to attack socalled ‘‘sanctuary’’ jurisdictions (many of whom do not consider themselves as such) by penalizing state and local jurisdictions that follow the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by refusing to honor constitutionally infirm requests for detainers. H.R. 3003 penalizes jurisdictions by eliminating various federal grants, including funding through the Cops on the Beat program, the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and any other federal grant related to law enforcement or immigration. Importantly, using the threat of withholding federal grants to coerce state and local jurisdictions likely runs afoul of the Tenth Amendment’s prohibition on commandeering, a position supported by over 300 law professors. ‘‘Sanctuary’’ policies are critical to promote public safety for local communities. Fearing referral to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, victims and witnesses of crime are significantly less likely to communicate with local law enforcement. Local law enforcement authorities have repeatedly echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that community policing policies are paramount to enhancing public safety. Indeed, ‘‘sanctuary’’ jurisdictions have less crime and more economic development than similarly situated non‘‘sanctuary’’ jurisdictions. Withholding criticallyneeded federal funding would, paradoxically, severely cripple the ability of state and local jurisdictions to satisfy the public safety needs of their communities. Kate’s Law, H.R. 3004, would further criminalize the immigrant community by drastically increasing penalties for immigrants convicted of unlawful reentry. Operation Streamline encapsulates our nation’s failed experiment with employing criminal penalties to deter migration. Under Operation Streamline, the federal government prosecutes immigrants for reentry at significant rates. By all practical measures, Operation Streamline has failed to deter migration, wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, and unfairly punished thousands of immigrants who try to enter or reenter the United States to reunite with their children and loved ones. We fear that H.R. 3004’s increased penalties for reentry would double down on this failed strategy, explode the prison population, and cost billions of dollars. Instead of passing discredited enforcement only legislation, Congress should move forward on enacting just immigration reform legislation that provides a roadmap to citizenship for the nation’s eleven million aspiring Americans and eliminates mass detention and deportation programs that undermine fundamental human rights. Legislation that erodes public safety, disrespects local democratic processes, and raises serious constitutional concerns represents an abdication of the Congress’ responsibility to enact fair, humane, and just immigration policy. In light of the above, we urge you to vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate’s Law, H.R. 3004. Sincerely,

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting issue with the canvas in the back of the entire immigration laws that need to be addressed. This body—not the body at the other end of the building, this body—didn’t have the guts to address it 4 years ago, 3 years ago, 2 years ago, nor this year. This is something that we need to address, even though it is not the bill itself. I am a strong supporter of law enforcement. As cochair of the Law Enforcement Caucus, I rise in total opposition to this bill and the rule. Here is what the misguided goal of this bill would do: You are going to prove a point by penalizing law enforcement for immigration policies politicians in their city have to implement. That is what you want to do. So it absolves us down here in Washington. This bill threatens the central Federal funding streams for law enforcement. You have heard all of those programs that are being endangered. Any grant administered by the Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security that is substantially related to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, or naturalization you are putting on the chopping block if this bill becomes law. This bill would not make our communities safer. In fact, it undermines public safety. The funding this bill puts at risk allows local police departments to purchase equipment and hire and provide training for officers. This actually jeopardizes the security—read my lips—of communities in order to perpetuate a false narrative about immigrants. b1300 I just received a letter from the New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association. I think it says it better than anything I could say. It says: ‘‘Politics should not interfere with the safety of our members or our ability to do our job.’’ The police are telling us that, and you are asking them to go out and do the job of protecting our citizens day in and day out—which we all are, I hope—and then you are telling them: But I am sorry, because we have a disagreement on this issue, you are going to suffer the consequences. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from the New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association. 
NEWJERSEY STATE POLICEMEN ’S BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION , INC., Woodbridge, NJ, June 28, 2017. Re H.R. 3003. Hon. WILLIAM PASCRELL , Jr., Paterson, NJ. DEAR CONGRESSMAN PASCRELL : The New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association (NJSPBA) represents over 33,000 law enforcement officers throughout our state. It is no secret that law enforcement officers risk their own safety every day to keep our 
communities safe. And as a strong supporter of law enforcement on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, we would like to thank you for all your efforts on behalf of the men and women that serve within the law enforcement community. It is our understanding that this week the House is voting on H.R. 3003, the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,’’ which adds additional obstacles to funding for the hiring of additional police officers in certain communities throughout our state. Specifically, the bill restricts municipalities from receiving grants administered by the Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security if municipal officials fail to notify the federal government with regard to the presence of individuals as it relates to information regarding citizenship or immigration status. While we strongly agree that state and local law enforcement should work closely with federal law enforcement, cutting off funding for law enforcement to already underfunded and understaffed police departments and law enforcement entities undermines our collective efforts to keep our members and the communities they serve safe. Politics should not interfere with the safety of our members or our ability to do our job. On behalf of our membership, we appreciate your ongoing efforts and hope you will continue to work with your colleagues in Congress to assure funding for law enforcement and prevent our government from punishing our membership for something that is completely out of our control. I am available to discuss our opposition to H.R. 3003 further, at your convenience. You can reach me at our NJSPBA offices, if you have any questions. Thank you for all your efforts on behalf of the men and women of law enforcement. Sincerely, PATRICK COLLIGAN , State President. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, congressional Republicans are doing that right here. They are playing politics with our Nation’s security. To quote the New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association again—these words are from the police, not me—‘‘ . . . punishing our membership for something that is completely out of our control.’’ Why are the police opposed to this legislation? The Fraternal Order of Police you have heard about. Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle like to talk the talk when it comes to supporting law enforcement until it either costs money or we are going to have to deal with the bigger factors. That is a fact. You may laugh all you want, but that is a fact. I can cite you chapter and verse if you want. This is no laughing matter. This is business. This is the lives of the police. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to address remarks to the Chair. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I will address my remarks to the Chair, but I also will not stand here and let it be said from some political angle that the son of a Georgia State trooper has anything less than respect for law enforcement or wants anything more than to have law enforcement agencies do their job. And this is exactly what we are talking about. Do your job. If you want to make a political statement, then work it out politically. But this is: Do your job, keep the law. I mean, what else—are we going to get another letter from another police association saying: Well, we decided we are not going to enforce Federal whatever else? This is an issue that needs to be discussed, and I will just simply say, from this perspective, of one who has lived it for 50 years and who lived it under the same house for 21 years, no, there is no one that respects law enforcement and their role more than this Member. And this Member is simply reflecting a lot of views of law enforcement. This says: Let us do our job. We will work on these issues, but you are making a choice. If you don’t want to enforce it, then don’t take the money. Do what you want to do. Just don’t take the money. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ) in order to respond. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I think that is a very pathetic way to look at our police officers in this country. ‘‘If you don’t like it, don’t take the money.’’ You must be kidding me. I urge my colleagues to find a different tactic to penalize political decisions that you don’t like. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are, again, reminded to address their remarks to the Chair, not to individuals on the floor. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question. And if we do defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to this rule to bring up Representative BOBBY SCOTT’s Raise the Wage Act, H.R. 15, which would finally give workers the raise they deserve, and increase the Federal minimum wage to $15 an hour within 7 years. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ) to discuss our proposal. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, America needs a raise. We have not raised the minimum wage in 10 years, and people who work hard every single day have seen their pay erode again and again. Mr. Speaker, people who are working full time at $7.25 an hour can’t make it. And if we can defeat this previous question, we can actually bring up something that the American people really need, which is to get a raise. Mr. Speaker, this is not something we are going to dump on top of business all at once. There is a ladder up. It takes 7 years to get to that $15, but, Mr. Speaker, make no doubt that we need to do it. Mr. Speaker, right now, today, people working full time qualify for food stamps, housing assistance, and medical assistance because their employers don’t pay them enough to make it. And I know that everybody in this House knows that, when people work hard, they ought to be able to make it in America. If you work full time, you shouldn’t be in poverty. You should be able to afford a good apartment. You should be able to have good scheduling for your job. You should have some benefits. This is all the American Dream is about, being able to work hard and get paid fairly for it. Now, Mr. Speaker, I just want to let you know that between 2009 and 2013, we saw the top 1 percent of income earners get 85 percent of the income growth in this country. That means we have historic inequality not seen since the Great Depression. It is wrong, Mr. Speaker. And if we can defeat this previous question, we should do everything we can to pass this excellent piece of legislation that Ranking Member BOBBY SCOTT has authored in this body. Mr. SCOTT and I, as well as many other Members, have been all over this country, and right here in D.C. standing with workers explaining to us their struggles, how they haven’t seen a raise, how they haven’t seen their pay go up. And they are serious, Mr. Speaker, about wanting to be part of this economy, too. Pass this minimum wage increase. Give America a raise. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are trying to bring this to the floor by way of defeating the previous question is because the Republican majority in this House had basically locked everything down so we can’t get important bills to the floor. We can’t even get amendments to the underlying bill that we are debating here today. It is really unfortunate and sad for this institution. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this bill wrongfully endorses political interference with professional law enforcement leaders. With no legal authority, both President Trump and his Texan lookalike, Governor Greg Abbott, want to deny funds and intimidate 
local governments, who rightfully refuse to place politics above public safety. I will tell my Republican colleague from Georgia, and his colleagues, that the only lawlessness that exists here is the lawlessness of President Trump in trying to do this to such an extent that a Federal court order stopped him. And they will also, I believe, stop Governor Abbott on his outrageous Senate Bill 4. Our police chiefs in San Antonio and in Austin, our courageous Sheriff, Sally Hernandez, like many law enforcement professionals from Texas to New Jersey, they say that maintaining the trust and confidence of the immigrant community to report crime, to be witnesses concerning crime, that this makes us all safer—immigrant and nonimmigrant alike. Any proper arrest warrant presented by ICE will be honored everywhere. Detainers, which are merely a bureaucratic message saying the bureaucracy is suspicious of someone who should be imprisoned based on that suspicion, will not be kept imprisoned—and Federal courts have said they should not be—under the Constitution. I would say that the only sanctuary that this bill provides is a sanctuary for prejudice. It is a sanctuary that defies the reality of the America we have today, particularly in the Southwest. We should reject this bill and affirm welcoming cities, like mine, that are a refuge from antiimmigrant hysteria, but have a strong commitment to safety and to effective law enforcement, and looking to our local law enforcement, not political interference from Washington telling us how to protect our families. This very week, four years ago, an overwhelming bipartisan United States Senate majority approved comprehensive immigration reform. And like the amendments that are being blocked today, these House Republicans were so fearful that that bill might become law that they will not even permit us to even debate it four years later on the floor of this House. Instead of this antiimmigrant hysteria, instead of this sorry piece of legislation, what we need is broad immigration reform, and we need it now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), our former chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the gentleman from Georgia, a member of the Rules Committee, for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the underlying bill, H.R. 3003, No Sanctuary for Criminals Act; and I thank the chairman, BOBGOODLATTE , and Representatives STEVE KINGand A NDY BIGGS for introducing it. This legislation keeps dangerous criminal immigrants off our streets and out of our neighborhoods, and it holds sanctuary cities accountable for breaking Federal immigration laws. I have a special interest in this legislation because it enforces a bill I sponsored in 1969, which was enacted into law and made sanctuary cities illegal. The American people sent a clear message to Congress last November when they elected a President who promised to enforce our immigration laws. A recent poll shows that 80 percent—80 percent—of voters want cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes to be required to turn them over to immigration authorities. Eighty percent. That is a HarvardHarris poll. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is a down payment on our pledge to protect innocent Americans from criminal immigrants who deserve to be jailed or sent back to their home countries. We need to enact this legislation. There is simply no excuse for local governments to ignore immigration laws at the expense of American’s safety and wellbeing. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter to the entire Congress from the American Immigration Lawyers Association in opposition to this bill; a letter from Amnesty International in opposition to this bill; and a letter from Church World Services in opposition to this bill. 
STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN IMMIGRATION  LAWYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSING THE ‘‘NO SANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT’’ (H.R. 3003) 
AND ‘‘KATE’SLAW’’ (H.R. 3004), J UNE 27, 2017. As the national bar association of over 15,000 immigration lawyers and law professors, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) opposes ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act’’ (H.R. 3003) and ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ (H.R. 3004). AILA recommends that members of Congress reject these bills which are scheduled to come before the House Rules Committee on June 27 and to the floor shortly thereafter. Though Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte stated that the bills will ‘‘enhance public safety,’’ they will do the just the opposite: undermine public safety and make it even harder for local law enforcement to protect their residents and communities. In addition, the bills which were made public less than a week before the vote and completely bypassed the Judiciary Committee, include provisions that will result in violations of due process and the Fourth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution. At a time when over 9 out 10 Americans support immigration reform and legalization of the undocumented, Republican leadership is asking the House to vote on enforcement only bills that will lead to more apprehensions, deportations, and prosecutions of thousands of immigrants and their families who have strong ties to the United States. Instead of criminalizing and scapegoating immigrants, Congress should be offering workable reforms that will strengthen our economy and our country. 
3003 H.R. 3003 would undermine public safety and interfere with local policing: H.R. 3003 would amend 8 §U.S.C. 1373 to prevent states or localities from establishing laws or policies that prohibit or ‘‘in any way’’ restrict compliance with or cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill dramatically expands 8 U.S.C. §1373 which is more narrowly written and prohibits local law enforcement from restricting the sharing and exchange of information with federal authorities, but only with respect to an individual’s citizenship or immigration status. Rather than empowering localities, the extremely broad wording of H.R. 3003 would strip localities of the ability to enact commonsense crime prevention policies that ensure victims of crime will seek protection and report crimes. The bill would also undermine public safety by prohibiting DHS from honoring criminal warrants of communities deemed ‘‘sanctuary cities’’ if the individual being sought by local law enforcement has a final order of removal. Under H.R. 3003, localities that fail to comply with federal immigration efforts are penalized with the denial of federal funding for critical law enforcement, national security, drug treatment, and crime victim initiatives, including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and Byrne JAG programs that provide hundreds of millions of dollars to localities nationwide. In an effort to force localities to engage in civil immigration enforcement efforts, including those against nonviolent undocumented immigrants, the bill would make it far more difficult for many localities, including large cities, to arrest and prosecute potentially dangerous criminals. The bill could even offer criminals a form of immunity, knowing that any crimes they commit in a designated sanctuary city would result, at most, in their removal from the country as opposed to criminal prosecution. H.R. 3003 would run afoul of constitutional safeguards in the Fourth Amendment: By prohibiting localities from restricting or limiting their own cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, H.R. 3003 effectively compels localities to honor ICE detainer requests—a controversial and constitutionally suspect practice that is nonetheless widelyused by ICE. Federal courts have found that ICE use of detainers violates the Fourth Amendment, and that localities may be held liable for honoring them. The bill also expands detainer authority by establishing that ICE may issue detainer requests for localities to hold undocumented immigrants for up to 96 hours—twice what is currently allowed—even if probable cause has not been shown. Courts have concluded that localities cannot continue detaining someone unless ICE obtains a warrant from a neutral magistrate who has determined there is probable cause, or in the case of a warrantless arrest, review by a neutral magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. The expansive provisions in H.R. 3003 would force localities to choose between detaining people in violation of the Constitution or being punished as a ‘‘sanctuary city.’’ Furthermore, this bill provides government actors and private contractors with immunity if they are sued for violating the Constitution. Provisions in this bill transfer the financial burden of litigation by substituting the federal government for the local officers as the defendant. If H.R. 3003 becomes law, American taxpayers would be stuck paying for lawsuits brought by those who are unjustly detained. The bill goes even further by creating a private right of action allowing crime victims or their family members to sue localities if the crime was committed by someone who was released by the locality that did not honor an ICE detainer request. H.R. 3003 would violate the Tenth Amendment: H.R. 3003 would compel states and localities to utilize their local law enforcement resources to implement federal civil 
immigration enforcement in violation of the Tenth Amendment’s ‘‘commandeering’’ principle. The Tenth Amendment does not permit the federal government to force counties and cities to allocate local resources, including police officers, technology, and personnel, to enforce federal immigration law. The federal government also cannot withhold funds from localities refusing to participate in federal efforts if the programs affected are unrelated to the purpose of the federal program, or if the sanctions are punitive in nature. H.R. 3003 would expand detention without due process: H.R. 3003 would increase the use of detention without ensuring those detained have access to a bond determination. Under the bill, nearly anyone who is undocumented, including those who have overstayed their visa would be subject to detention without a custody hearing. The bill also establishes that DHS has the authority to detain individuals ‘‘without time limitation’’ during the pendency of removal proceedings. These provisions would dramatically expand the federal government’s power to indefinitely detain individuals, and would likely result in ever growing numbers of undocumented immigrants held in substandard detention facilities. 
NO’’ ON H.R. 3003 AND H .R. 3004 DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of Amnesty International USA (‘‘AIUSA’’) and our more than one million members and supporters nationwide, we strongly urge you to oppose the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) and Kate’s Law (H.R. 3004). Both bills are scheduled for House floor votes as early as June 28. If passed, both bills would pave the way for and accelerate the implementation of policies that increase the criminalization and detention of immigrants and asylum seekers, thereby violating the United States’ obligations under international law. AIUSA will be scoring these votes. I. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) would prevent municipalities from determining how law enforcement agencies are engaging in immigration enforcement, and would dramatically expand indefinite detention and mandatory detention of immigrants in jaillike facilities with subpar dangerous conditions, in violation of international human rights standards. H.R. 3003 would prevent localities from enacting community trust policies that instruct local police not to carry out federal immigration enforcement, thereby undermining policing practices designed to build trust and confidence between local law enforcement and the communities they serve. This bill would open the door to racial profiling against Latinos and other communities of color, including U.S. citizens. International law firmly prohibits discrimination, and the United States’ commitment to those obligations applies to citizens and noncitizens alike. States that have passed antiimmigrant legislation that requires local law enforcement to cooperate with immigration agencies or to inquire about immigration status regarding any interactions with law enforcement have compromised the right to justice for immigrant communities by discouraging immigrant survivors from reporting crimes. The U.S. government has an obligation to prevent and address abuse of immigrants and ensure that all immigrants are able to access available remedies. This includes acting with due diligence to investigate and punish criminal conduct committed by private individuals, and guaranteeing access to justice for immigrant victims of crime. Amnesty International has also documented how the increased involvement of state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement, without adequate oversight and accountability to prevent abuses, contributes to the rise in reports of racial profiling for Latino communities and other communities of color. Numerous studies have demonstrated that programs that integrate the criminal justice system and law enforcement as an entry point for immigration enforcement have led to racial profiling and other abuses. In addition, H.R. 3003 would dramatically expand the Department of Homeland Security (‘‘DES’’) immigration detention powers by authorizing mandatory detention ‘‘without time limitation.’’ This would empower the DHS to detain untold numbers of immigrants for as long as it takes to conclude immigration court removal proceedings, even if that takes years. Section 4 would also authorize indefinite mandatory detention Without providing the basic due process of an immigration judge bond hearing to determine if the immigrant’s imprisonment was justified in the first place. Finally, section 4 would expand mandatory detention of immigrants with no criminal record whatsoever, including immigrants who overstayed a visa or lack legal papers. The mandatory detention system, which provides for the automatic detention of individuals, amounts to arbitrary detention, and is in violation of international law, which requires that detention be justified in each individual case and be subject to judicial review. The expansion of offenses which would fall under mandatory detention as demonstrated in H.R., as proposed by H.R. 3003, amounts to arbitrary detention, and is in violation of international law, which requires that detention be justified in each individual case and be subject to judicial review. U.S. federal courts have also consistently held that detaining immigrants for months and years without bond hearings raises serious problems under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The proposed dramatic expansion of immigration detention powers envisioned in H.R. 3003 comes at a time when immigration detention has already hit recordhighs, with the average daily population (‘‘ADP’’) exceeding 40,000 in comparison to a 34,000 ADP for the preceding seven years. This sharp escalation in the number of detained immigrants also comes at a time when Human Rights Watch (‘‘HRW’’) has reported new evidence of dangerously subpar medical care in immigration detention, including unreasonable delays in care and unqualified medical staff that are likely to expose a record number of immigrants to dangerous conditions. This recent HRW report is only the latest of a series of shocking reports documenting DHS’s failure to provide care to ill or injured immigrants in its custody. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the United States has ratified, guarantees all people the rights to be free from discrimination and arbitrary arrest and detention, and the right to due process, including fair deportation procedures. Finally, noncitizens who are detained have a right to humane conditions of detention and are entitled to prompt review 
of their detention by an independent court. The mass expansion of mandatory detention and immigration detention proposed by H.R. 3003 violates all of these international human rights standards. II. H.R. 3004 would increase mass incarceration of immigrants, including survivors of persecution or torture, by increasing criminal penalties for the mere act of migration— in violation of international human rights standards. Current law already criminalizes illegal reentry in violation of international law and standards under 8 U.S.C. §1326, imposing a sentence of up to 20 years on anyone convicted of illegal reentry after committing an aggravated felony. According to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, in fiscal year 2016 federal criminal prosecutions for illegal entry, reentry, and similar immigration violations made up 52 percent of all federal prosecutions nationwide—surpassing drugs, weapons, fraud and thousands of other crimes. Criminal penalties for unauthorized entry are obstacles for identifying the victims of human rights abuses, and prevent victims from seeking justice. They undermine human rights protections afforded in international law, including the right to seek asylum. The Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants has repeatedly stressed that where detention is used as a punitive measure, it is disproportionate and inappropriate, and stigmatizes undocumented immigrants as criminals. The criminal prosecution of illegal reentry has grown exponentially over the past decade. In 2002 there were 8,000 prosecutions for illegal reentry; in 2012 these prosecutions had increased to 37,000. Nearly 99 percent of illegal reentry defendants were sentenced to federal prison time, ranging from a few days to 10 years or more for felony reentry before they are eventually deported. Beyond the trend towards more aggressive criminal prosecutions for illegal reentry, a 2015 U.S. Sentencing Commission report found nearly 50 percent of people sentenced in fiscal 2013 for illegal reentry had at least one child living in the U.S. Many of the individuals charged with illegal reentry previously resided in the U.S. for many years and are desperate to return to their family in the U.S. On top of this longstanding trend of harsher criminal prosecution for illegal reentry— the sponsors of H.R. 3004 would seek to expand the category of individuals subject to illegal reentry prosecution to include people who surrender themselves at the southern border to seek protection in the U.S. The bill would also expand sentencing enhancements for illegal reentry, and would prosecute people for illegal reentry even if their previous removal orders were unlawful or deprived them of the opportunity to seek protection. For example, the bill would criminalize asylum seekers who return to the U.S. after being previously denied the opportunity to present their claims for protection. While all sovereign states have a legitimate interest in regulating entry into their territories, they can only do so within the limits of their obligations under international law. The U.S. government has an obligation under international human rights law to ensure that its laws, policies, and practices do not place immigrants at an increased risk of human rights abuses. Specifically, individuals have a right to seek asylum from persecution and protection from refoulement, and prosecuting asylum seekers prior to adjudication of their asylum applications violates U.S. obligations under the Refugee Convention. Similarly the Convention Against Torture prohibits a State from expelling, returning, or extraditing a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that s/he would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Finally, all individuals, regardless of immigration status, have a right to family unity which can include limits on the State’s power to deport, as recognized by the Human Rights Committee’s interpretation of ICCPR obligations All of these international human rights standards are violated by H.R. 3004. AIUSA strongly urges you to oppose both H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004. Sincerely, JOANNE LIN, Senior Managing Director, Advocacy and Government Affairs. 
CWS S TATEMENT TO OPPOSING H.R. 3003, THE NOSANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT, AND H.R. 3004, KATE’SLAW As a 71year old humanitarian organization representing 37 Protestant, Anglican, and Orthodox communions and 34 refugee resettlement offices across the country, Church World Service (CWS) urges all Members of Congress to support the longstanding efforts of law enforcement officials to foster trusting relationships with the communities they protect and serve. As we pray for peace and an end to senseless acts of violence that are too prevalent in this country, CWS encourages the U.S. Congress to refrain from politicizing tragedies or conflating the actions of one person with an entire community of our immigrant brothers and sisters and oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law. H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, would target more than 600+ cities, counties, and states across the country and threaten to take away millions of dollars in federal funding that local police use to promote public safety. Communities are safer when they commit to policies that strengthen trust and cooperation between local law enforcement, community leadership and institutions, and all residents, regardless of immigration status. The Federal government should not hurt intentional, communitybased policing efforts that are vital in communities across the country. Many cities have already recognized that requests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold individuals beyond their courtappointed sentences violate due process and have been found unconstitutional by federal courts. This bill would raise profound constitutional concerns by prohibiting localities from declining to comply with ICE detainer requests even when such compliance would violate federal court orders and the U.S. Constitution. Local police that refuse ICE detainer requests see an increase in public safety due to improved trust from the community. It is precisely this trust that enables community members to report dangerous situations without the fear of being deported or separated from their families. When local police comply with ICE detainer requests, more crimes go unreported because victims and witnesses are afraid of being deported if they contact the police. This bill would also undermine local criminal prosecutions by allowing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ignore state or local criminal warrants and refuse to transfer individuals to state or local custody in certain circumstances. This bill would reduce community safety by preventing state and local jurisdictions from holding people accountable. The United States already spends more than $18 billion on immigration enforcement per year, more than all other federal law enforcement agencies combined. H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law, would expand the federal government’s ability to prosecute individuals for ‘‘illegal reentry’’ and impose even more severe penalties in these cases—even though prosecutions for migrationrelated offenses already make up more than 50% of all federal prosecutions. Yet, this bill does not include adequate protections for individuals who reenter the U.S. in order to seek protection, which would place asylum seekers at risk of being returned to the violence and persecution they fled. We have seen how Border Patrol’s current practices violate existing U.S. law and treaty obligations by preventing viable asylum claims from moving forward. DHS has found that in some areas, Border Patrol refers asylum seekers for criminal prosecution despite the fact that they have expressed fear of persecution. In May 2017, a report was released highlighting that many asylum seekers, who had expressed a fear of returning to their home countries are being turned away by GBP agents. New barriers to protection are unnecessary and would dangerously impede our obligations under international and U.S. law. Federal, state, and local policies that focus on deportation do not reduce crime rates. Individuals are being deported who present no risk to public safety and who are longstanding community members, including parents of young children. Immigrants come to this country to reunite with family, work, and make meaningful contributions that enrich their communities. Several studies over the last century have affirmed that all immigrants, regardless of nationality or status, are less likely than U.S. citizens to commit violent crimes. A recent report found a correlation between the increase in undocumented immigrants, and the sharp decline in violent and property crime rates. Immigration is correlated with significantly higher employment growth and a decline in the unemployment rate, and immigrants have high entrepreneurial rates, creating successful businesses that hire immigrant and U.S. citizen employees. As communities of faith, we are united by principles of compassion, stewardship, and justice. CWS urges all Members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law. What we need are real solutions and immigration policies that treat our neighbors with the dignity and respect that all people deserve and affirm local law enforcement officer’s efforts to build trust with their communities. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Again, Mr. Speaker, our objection is that Washington doesn’t always know best. We ought to trust our local law enforcement officials, our local police as to what is effective in terms of protecting the citizens of our community. To introduce legislation that would essentially punish our local police for doing what they think is in the best interest of their communities, this bill should be renamed ‘‘punish our local police,’’ because that is what it does. I can’t believe that we are going down this road. Maybe it is a nice sound bite, maybe it is a nice press release, maybe it fits in with the Trump campaign rhetoric on immigrants and immigration; but this is just a lousy idea. And I think if we did hearings on this bill, if we actually spent some time being thoughtful about this issue, my colleagues would come to that conclusion. Again, I would say that what we should be talking about is fixing our 
broken immigration system. We need comprehensive immigration reform. The Senate, in a bipartisan way, stepped up to the plate and did it. It is about time Members of this House have the guts to bring a comprehensive immigration reform bill to the floor and fix our broken immigration system. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3003. This is a very positive first step toward coming to grips with an issue that has divided this country because it is causing great damage to so many Americans. What we are talking about is not immigrant hysteria. That type of mixing legal immigrants with illegal immigrants, that is the true racism because it hurts those people who have come here legally. Now, what we have got here are legal immigrants who are being cast into the same pot as illegals, with the opposition to this bill. People who are here legally understand that we need protection for people who are here in this country against, especially, criminals who come from overseas and illegal aliens who are criminals, at that. Working Americans of every race, religion, and ethnic group have seen that their families are less secure, and they are even sometimes being murdered by the insane lack of action on the part of our government to protect our citizens. Our number one responsibility is to make sure our own people, legal immigrants, and all Americans of every race, creed, and color are protected. And what do they see? This massive flood of illegals coming into our country, taking jobs, bidding down wages, lowering the education standards and the healthcare that most Americans rely upon. b1315 No wonder the American people want action. But then, when they are faced with a city saying even criminals who have committed acts of aggression, murder, et cetera, upon our citizens, that we are going to let them just stay, and that there is going to be a block. Whose side are you on is what this amendment is all about. Are we on the side of the American people? Are we on the side of those victims who work hard every day and try to raise their families; or are we on the side of a massive flow of people, many of whom, and most of whom, are good people? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Most of the people who come here, most of the people flooding here, even the illegals, are basically wonderful people. But that doesn’t mean that we can bring in more than that, 1 million— By the way, we need to understand, don’t condemn America on its immigration policy. We let a million legal immigrants into our country every year, and that is more than the rest of the world combined. We can be proud of that. But, at the same time, we have to make sure that our people are protected, that they don’t lose their jobs, or they don’t have to accept less money for the same work because you have got somebody here who will work for nothing. We want to make sure when they need their healthcare, they get their healthcare. That will bankrupt our system. Are we going to have a sanctuary healthcare system, too, so anybody in the world can come here and use up our scarce health dollars? No, it is time for us to strike a blow for the protection of Americans and legal immigrants of every race and religion and ethnic background, not to show these things. Immigrant hysteria; shame, shame, shame. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I include in the RECORD a letter to every Member of Congress from The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights in opposition to this bill; a letter to all of us from the ACLU in opposition to this bill; a letter to every Member of Congress from the National Task Force to End Sexual & Domestic Violence that is in opposition to this bill; as well as a letter to Members of Congress from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Catholic Charities USA in opposition to this bill; and a letter from NETWORK, which is a lobby for Catholic social justice in opposition to this bill. 
ONCIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS , Washington, DC, June 27, 2017. 
ACT’’ (H.R. 3003) AND ‘‘KATE ’S LAW ’’ (H.R. 3004) DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200 national advocacy organizations, I urge you to oppose H.R. 3003, the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,’’ and H.R. 3004, ‘‘Kate’s Law.’’ These two bills may sound ‘‘tough,’’ but they would ultimately make the problems with our national immigration system even worse than they already are. H.R. 3003 would unnecessarily and unwisely penalize states and municipalities that are attempting to strike the delicate balance between cooperating with federal immigration authorities, on one hand, and respecting the constraints imposed on them by the U.S. Constitution, on the other. At the same time, it would do nothing to address the constitutional concerns raised by the use of immigration ‘‘detainer’’ requests, concerns that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) itself has recognized in the past. Among its provisions, H.R. 3003 would eliminate various federal law enforcement grants to states and municipalities, such as the ‘‘Cops on the Beat’’ program, unless jurisdictions comply with all DHS detainer requests. It aims to overturn local policies adopted by over 300 jurisdictions across the country that have determined, as a matter of constitutional law and sound public policy, including community policing efforts, that they cannot hold individuals beyond their release dates solely on the basis of a DHS detainer request. The senseless and tragic 2015 killing of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco has renewed the debate over socalled ‘‘sanctuary cities.’’ Yet the term suggests, incorrectly, that certain states and municipalities are refusing to work with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The truth is that state and local law enforcement agencies (‘‘LEAs’’) throughout the country already aid in the identification of individuals who are subject to immigration enforcement action through the sharing of fingerprints of those who are taken into custody. LEAs with limited detainer policies have determined, however, that they cannot continue to detain individuals for immigration enforcement purposes, under the Fourth Amendment and pursuant to numerous court rulings, unless DHS obtains a judicial warrant, as all other law enforcement agencies are required to do. H.R. 3003 would not address the Fourth Amendment concerns raised by the use of DHS detainers. Instead, it would leave many state and municipal governments in an untenable position: either they must disregard their constitutional responsibilities and erode the trust they have built between the police and the communities they serve, or they will face the loss of vital federal law enforcement funding that helps them fight crime in their jurisdictions. Congress should not force such an arbitrary and unwise choice on cities. H.R. 3004, the other immigrationrelated bill expected to come to the House floor this week, would significantly increase sentences for previouslyremoved individuals who reenter the country. While the bill is an improvement over other bills by the same name, in that it does not include mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, it would still lead to a likely increase in the federal prison population without any tangible benefits. The Department of Justice’s ‘‘Operation Streamline’’ program, upon which this bill would build, has already shown that increased criminal prosecutions do little but waste resources while failing to deter unauthorized border crossings. It should be ended, not expanded. For these reasons, I urge you to vote against H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004. Sincerely, VANITA GUPTA , President & CEO. 
AMERICAN CIVILLIBERTIES UNION, Washington, DC, June 27, 2017. Re ACLU Opposes H.R. 3003 (No Sanctuary for Criminals Act) and H.R. 3004 (Kate’s Law). Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI : On behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (‘‘ACLU’’), we submit this letter to the House of Representatives to express our strong opposition to H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law. 
NO SANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT (H .R. 3003) H.R. 3003 conflicts with the principles of the Fourth Amendment. H.R. 3003 defies the Fourth Amendment by amending 8 USC Section 1373 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (‘‘INA’’) to force localities to comply with unlawful detainer requests or risk losing federal funding. This is despite the fact that an ‘‘increasing number of federal court decisions’’ have held that ‘‘detainerbased detention by state and local law enforcement agencies violates the 
KATE ’S LAW (H .R. 3004) H.R. 3004 is piecemeal immigration enforcement that expands America’s federal prison population and lines the coffers of private prison companies. Increasing the maximum sentences for illegal reentrants is unnecessary, wasteful, and inhumane. H.R. 3004 envisions a federal criminal justice system that prosecutes asylumseekers, persons providing humanitarian assistance to migrants in distress, and parents who pose no threat to public safety in returning to the U.S. to reunite with children who need their care (individuals with children in the United States are 50 percent of those convicted of illegal reentry). Current law already imposes a sentence of up to 20 years on anyone convicted of illegally reentering the country who has committed an aggravated felony. U.S. Attorneys’ Offices aggressively enforce these provisions. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, immigration prosecutions account for 52 percent of all federal prosecutions—surpassing drugs, weapons, fraud and thousands of other crimes. Nearly 99 percent of illegal reentry defendants are sentenced to federal prison time. H.R. 3004 would drastically expand America’s prison population of nonviolent prisoners at a time when there is bipartisan support to reduce the federal prison population. It offends due process by cutting off all collateral attacks on unjust prior deportation orders, despite the Supreme Court’s contrary ruling in United States v. MendozaLopez. Profiteering by private prison companies has been the main consequence of bordercrossing prosecutions, which the Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of Inspector General have criticized as lacking sound deterrent support. H.R. 3004 is an integral part of this administration’s mass deportation and mass incarceration agenda. Longer sentences for illegal reentry are not recommended by any informed federal criminaljustice stakeholders; rather they represent this administration’s antiimmigrant obsession and would expensively expand substandard private jail contracting despite the lifethreatening conditions in these facilities. In conclusion, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 are fraught with constitutional problems that threaten the civil and human rights of our immigrant communities, undercut law enforcement’s ability to keep our communities safe, and would balloon our federal prison population by financing private prison corporations. Rather than taking a punitive approach to local law enforcement agencies that are working hard to balance their duties to uphold the Constitution and to keep their communities safe, Congress should end DHS’s unconstitutional detainer practices or fix the constitutional deficiencies by requiring judicial warrants for all detainer requests. Congress should also repeal mandatory detention so that all immigrants receive the basic due process of a bond hearing and reject any attempt to unfairly imprison individuals who are not a threat to public safety. For more information, please contact ACLU Director of Immigration Policy and Campaigns. Sincerely, FAIZSHAKIR , National Political Director. LORELLA PRAELI , Director of Immigration Policy and Campaigns. 
NATIONAL TASKFORCE TO END SEXUAL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE , June 27, 2017. The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (NTF), comprised of national leadership organizations advocating on behalf of sexual assault and domestic violence victims and representing hundreds of organizations across the country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence receive the protections they deserve, write to express our deep concerns about the impact that H.R. 3003, the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,’’ and H.R. 3004, or ‘‘Kate’s Law,’’ will have on victims fleeing or recovering from sexual assault, domestic violence, or human trafficking, and on communities at large. This year is the twentythird anniversary of the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act (‘‘VAWA’’) which has, since it was first enacted, included critical protections for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence. H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 will have the effect of punishing immigrant survivors and their children and pushing them into the shadows and into danger, undermining the very purpose of VAWA. Specifically, the nation’s leading national organizations that address domestic and sexual assault oppose H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 because: Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing community safety. Laws that seek to intertwine the federal immigration and local law enforcement systems will undermine the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant victims into the shadows and undermining public safety. Immigration enforcement must be implemented in a way that supports local community policing and sustains community trust in working with local law enforcement. H.R. 3003 runs contrary to community policing efforts and will deter immigrant domestic violence and sexual assault survivors not only from reporting crimes, but also from seeking help for themselves and their children. While H.R. 3003 does not require that local law enforcement arrest or report immigrant victims or witnesses of criminal activity, the language in the bill provides no restriction prohibiting such practices. Perpetrators use fear of deportation as tool of abuse. Local policies that minimize the intertwining of local law enforcement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE) help protect the most vulnerable victims by creating trust between law enforcement and the immigrant community, which in turn help protect entire communities. Abusers and traffickers use the fear of deportation of their victims as a tool to silence and trap them. If immigrants are afraid to call the police because of fear of deportation, they become more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Not only are the individual victims and their children harmed, but their fear of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting violent perpetrators or seeking protection and, as a result, dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished. As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent crimes often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that they will be deported. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting the police and HR 3003 proposes to further intertwine federal immigration and local law enforcement systems will only exacerbate this fear. The result is that perpetrators will be able to continue to harm others, both immigrant and U.S. Citizen victims alike. Since January of 2017, victim advocates have been describing the immense fear expressed by immigrant victims and their reluctance to reach out for help from police. A recent survey of over 700 advocates and attorneys at domestic violence and sexual assault programs indicate that immigrant victims are expressing heightened fears and concerns about immigration enforcement, with 78% of advocates and attorneys reporting that victims are describing fear of contacting the police; 75% of them reporting that victims are afraid of going to court; and 43% reporting working with immigrant victims who are choosing not to move forward with criminal charges or obtaining protective orders. In addition, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, reporting of sexual assault and domestic violence among Latinos has dropped significantly this year, possibly due to concerns that police interaction could result in deportation. According to Chief Beck, reports of sexual assault have dropped 25 percent among Los Angeles’ Latino population since the beginning of the year compared to a three percent drop among nonLatino victims. Similarly, reports of spousal abuse among Latinos fell by about 10 percent among Latinos whereas the decline among nonLatinos was four percent. The Houston Police Department reported in April that the number of Hispanics reporting rape is down 42.8 percent from last year. In Denver, CO, the Denver City Attorney has reported that some domestic violence victims are declining to testify in court. As of late February, the City Attorney’s Office had dropped four cases because the victims fear that ICE officers will arrest and deport them. Both the City Attorney and Aurora Police Chief have spoken on the importance of having trust with the immigrant community in order to maintain public safety and prosecute crime. HR 3003 Will Unfairly Punish Entire Communities. H.R. 3003 punishes localities that follow Constitutional guidelines and refuse to honor detainer requests that are not supported by due process mandates. H.R. 3003 likely covers more than 600 jurisdictions across the country, most of which do not characterize their policies to follow constitutional mandates as ‘‘sanctuary’’ policies. H.R. 3003 penalizes jurisdictions by eliminating their access to various federal grants, including federal law enforcement grants, such as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and other federal grants related to law enforcement or immigration, such as those that fund forensic rape kit analysis. Withholding federal law enforcement funding would, ironically, undermine the ability of local jurisdictions to combat and prevent crime in their communities. In addition, the fiscal impact of both H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 will result in limited federal law enforcement resources being further reduced as a result of shifting funding from enforcing federal criminal laws addressing violent crimes, including those protecting victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, to the detention and prosecution of many nonviolent immigration law violaters. H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 Will Unfairly Punish Victims. By greatly expanding mandatory detention and expanding criminal penalties for reentry, H.R. 3003 and H.R.3004 will have harsh consequences for immigrant survivors. Victims of human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence are often at risk of being arrested and convicted. In recognition of this fact, existing ICE guidance cites the example of when police respond to a domestic violence call, both parties may be arrested or a survivor who acted in selfdefense may be wrongly accused. In addition, if the abuser speaks English better than the survivor, or if other language or cultural barriers (or fear of retaliation from the abuser) prevent the survivor from fully disclosing the abuse suffered, a survivor faces charges and tremendous pressure to plead guilty (without being advised about the longterm consequences) in order to be released from jail and reunited with her children. In addition, victims of trafficking are often arrested and convicted for prostitutionrelated offenses. These victims are often desperate to be released and possibly to be reunited with their children following their arrests or pending trial. These factors—combined with poor legal counsel, particularly about the immigration consequences of criminal pleas and convictions—have in the past and will likely continue to lead to deportation of wrongly accused victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of domestic violence charges and/or prostitution. H.R. 3003 imposes harsh criminal penalties and H.R. 3009 imposes expanded bases for detention without consideration of mitigating circumstances or humanitarian exceptions for these victims. In addition, HR. 3004 expands the criminal consequences for reentry in the U.S. without recognizing the compelling humanitarian circumstances in which victims who have been previously removed return for their safety. Victims of domestic and sexual violence and trafficking fleeing violence in their countries of origin will be penalized for seeking protection from harm. In recent years, women and children fleeing rampant violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, have fled to the United States, seeking refuge. Frequently, because of inadequate access to legal representation, they are unable to establish their eligibility for legal protections in the United States, resulting in their removal. In many cases, the risk of domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or human trafficking in their countries of origin remain unabated and victims subsequently attempt to reenter the U.S. to protect themselves and their children. Other victims of domestic and sexual violence and trafficking may be deported because their abusers or traffickers isolate them, or prevent them from obtaining lawful immigration status. They are deported, with some victims having to leave their children behind in the custody of their abusers or traffickers. Under H.R. 3004, these victims risk harsh criminal penalties for reentry for attempting to protect themselves and their children. On behalf of the courageous survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and human trafficking that our organizations serve, we urge you to vote against HR 3003 and 3004, and to affirm the intent and spirit of VAWA by supporting strong relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities, which is critical for public safety in general, and particularly essential for domestic and sexual violence victims and their children. Sincerely, THENATIONAL TASKFORCE TO ENDSEXUAL  
JUNE26, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : We write on behalf of the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/ COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004. The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our parishes include those with and without immigration status, unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of crime in the United States, including domestic violence, armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of fostering cooperation and informationsharing between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on local governments that we fear—and that many of them have warned—would undermine authority and discretion of local law enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure public safety in all communities. Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be noncompliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network, including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the federal government on a number of Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including disaster response and recovery, naturalization and citizenship services, and services for the immigrant, including victims of human trafficking, and domestic violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the protection and promotion of the human person and in some instances lifesaving. Cutting grants related to these important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not humane or just, nor is it in our national interest. Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion of incarceration and does not include adequate protections for people who reenter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or seek protection at the border. While H.R. 3004 makes notable efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal by expanding the government’s ability to prosecute illegal reentry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry or reentry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does not advance the common good nor will it ensure that communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as introduced, H.R. 3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented themselves repeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from violence), from being able to access protection, and instead face fines, imprisonment or both. 
We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs and rights of immigrants with our nation’s best interests and security. The United States has a long and proud history of leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of our views in this regard. Sincerely, MOSTREV. JOEVA´SQUEZ , Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration. SR. DONNA MARKHAM , OP, PHD, President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA. 
JUNE27, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE MCGOVERN : NET WORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice stands in strong opposition to the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act’’ (H.R. 3003) and ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ (H.R. 3004) to be considered this week by the House of Representatives. We urge Congress to reject these bills. In a country that prides itself on being the land of welcome and opportunity, we must ensure that our immigration laws reflect our shared values. As Congress continues to delay comprehensive immigration reform and a permanent solution for the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants, we are left with the status quo—an enforcementonly approach that tears apart families and keeps people in the shadows. Despite the gridlock in Congress, localities across the country still have the responsibility to uphold safety and peace in their communities. To fulfill this goal, local police and residents have fostered mutual trust to root out crime and promote public safety, encouraging community members to cooperate with local authorities. The ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act’’ (H.R. 3003) does nothing to promote public safety and instead will make communities more dangerous while striking fear in the hearts of our immigrant families. Likewise, ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ (H.R. 3004) would criminalize immigrants who simply want an opportunity to succeed in the United States, and often are simply trying to be reunited with their family. Punishing immigrants for wanting to provide for their families with fines and imprisonment is harsh and cruel— we, as a nation, are called to be better than that. Again, we ask Congress to abandon the ‘‘enforcement first’’ policies that have been the de facto U.S. strategy for nearly thirty years, yielding too many costs and too few results. Our antiquated system that does not accommodate the migration realities we face in our nation today does not serve our national interests and does not respect the basic human rights of migrants who come to this nation fleeing persecution or in search of employment for themselves and better living conditions for their children. Pope Francis cautions that ‘‘migrants and refugees are not pawns on the chessboard of humanity’’ and he asks political leaders to create a new system, one that ‘‘calls for international cooperation and a spirit of profound solidarity and compassion.’’ This is a holy call to embrace hope over fear. Congress should recognize the Godgiven humanity of all individuals and uphold our sacred call to love our neighbor and welcome the stranger in our midst. Any action that further militarizes our borders, criminalizes assistance to immigrant communities, or weakens legal protection of refugees is neither just nor compatible with the values that we, as Americans, strive to uphold. Sincerely, SR. SIMONE CAMPBELL , SSS, Executive Director, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I, again, would simply say that if we really want to do something about immigration, we ought to come together, like the Senate did not long ago, and pass comprehensive immigration reform. But, apparently, that is not in the DNA of the current leadership of this House. Instead, we have bills that demagogue the immigration issue, that demean immigrants, that cause hysteria, and I find that very unfortunate. This bill is a bad idea. It falls in the same category as that other bad, stupid idea of building a wall across our country. What we ought to be doing is serious legislating, enough demagoguing, and let’s get back to doing the people’s business, and that includes comprehensive immigration reform. Mr. Speaker, as I said, we need to fix our immigration laws. When a mother in the Philippines has to wait 25 years or more for a visa to reunite with her son in the United States, is that system working? No. To lose the entire childhood and young adulthood of your son? What mother wouldn’t try to enter the United States some other way, in fact, any way that she could in order to be with her child? When your daughter is threatened with rape and murder if she doesn’t become a sexual slave to gang members; when your son and the entire family is threatened with death if the boy doesn’t join the gangs, wouldn’t you run away and try to find safety someplace else? And when the family arrives at the U.S. border and they actively seek out the U.S. Border Patrol and voluntarily surrender to them and ask for safe refuge and asylum, is that really entering our borders illegally? You know, when you have been an upstanding member of the community for 10, 15, 20 years or more in the United States, and you get pulled over because the tags have expired on your car, or your license, do you really deserve to be deported, to tear apart your family, to leave behind the businesses that you have spent a lifetime creating? And does anyone in this Chamber honestly think that if this father or mother is deported, that they won’t do everything they can to try to come back to be with their kids? I mean, these are real stories. It is not fiction. They are not fantasies. It is real. And if you listened to people in your community, you would know these stories. If you paid attention to your local police, you would know why it is so damaging to turn them in to ICE, because they rely on these community members to inform them of criminal activities in their community. The police don’t want to do what you are asking them to do. Why would you force this on them? And why would you punish them by taking away essential Federal funding to help them protect the citizens of this country? This is a bad idea. I guess, maybe it is a good press release. Maybe Steve Bannon thinks it is a good idea. Maybe it is a good sound bite for Trump. Who knows what the rationale behind this is. But it is not sensible. It is not thoughtful. So if you want to get serious about these issues, you know, come together, like the Senate did, in a bipartisan way, and come up with comprehensive immigration reform. That is our duty. That is our job, as Members of Congress, not this garbage. This is a waste of time. This is an insult to the American people. We ought to be able to do better. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this. I urge them to defeat the previous question so we can have a debate and vote on whether or not to increase the minimum wage to $15 to give people a raise. Again, we have to do that because this House is being so tightly controlled that you can’t get anything to the floor. I would remind my colleagues that the underlying bill that we are talking about here today on immigration is under a closed rule. We will have another closed rule tomorrow. So much for democracy. So much for deliberative process. So much for openness. There is no such thing here. I mean, the Rules Committee has become a place where democracy goes to die, where everything gets shut down. We need to do better. This process stinks, and this bill is lousy. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question, vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and if it gets to the point we have to debate this, vote ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I do believe that in just a little bit we will be debating this bill. I do believe in just a short time it will pass. I think what was very interesting, Mr. Speaker, is the frustrations of my friend, and I believe they are true frustrations, and the stories of folks coming from terrible places around the world wanting to get here. We are the light on a hill. We are the ones that everybody wants to come to. I grant you that. But I do have a question. For these folks who are leaving disaster, places in which law and order are not enforced, in which people are dying, and they are striving to get someplace else, 
why in the world would we want to get to here to find that we have a situation in which local law enforcement can sort of decide what they want to do, where law and order is not followed? You are leaving one area to get to an area in which what they say is law and order is what is needed and what is followed and why they come here, but yet we are saying no. I think it has also been, possibly, Mr. Speaker, a vast mischaracterization to say that all police are against this. In fact, if we have seen, there was 200 that was identified earlier, the vast majority of police departments in this country uphold the law. So let’s don’t make a blanket assessment of police here. I think it is just an interesting development here. I think you can talk about laws. You can like laws, you cannot like laws, you can do something about immigration. But I do think we also need to address something else. It wasn’t a part of this bill, but we wanted to make it a part of this bill, and that is comprehensive immigration reform. I do agree with my friend. There needs to be immigration reform. I think it needs to start with security and safety and protection. It needs to start with actually enforcing law, and then begin the foundation of finding a way to get workers here—our guest worker program, our ag worker program, the things that we need to make our expansion so that we do it properly. I agree completely. But, Mr. Speaker, I do find it has been amazing here because, just in the context of this debate, these were words that were used: We’re demagoguing this issue. We didn’t have the guts to address this issue. Our DNA of leadership is to obstruct or to not bring this forward. Well, I think the one thing that I do need to remind is, this body, Mr. Speaker, if you are very familiar with this, over the last few weeks, we have been dealing with a very difficult issue—we passed it out of the House— that is healthcare, which was passed when this body was filled in a majority of a different party, my friends across the aisle, when they had, at times, filibusterproof majorities. They worked to pass healthcare. They worked to pass DoddFrank. They worked to pass their priorities. My interesting question is, they did not work to pass comprehensive immigration reform. I am not sure why now we decide that it is such their issue that they are now blaming us, many of us who want to find a way forward. But I think the answer is plain and obvious in history. They chose not to do it. I repeat, they chose not to do it. So I think in the discussion of this battle, we will continue these discussions. We will continue to have differences of opinion. I think it is sort of amazing though that we do have to have a discussion here on telling police to enforce the law and work out the details as we go, work out what is in this bill. But it also is about priorities, Mr. Speaker. For those of us who have had to look at the tragedies left behind as a result of some of these decisions that they have made to ‘‘better’’ their community, the deaths, the tragedies, then it is a pretty interesting choice. Is the death more important or less important than your policy? All we are simply saying is: just don’t take the money. Look at it from that perspective. And we will continue to have these debates. My friend and I will continue to be passionately different on this, and that is okay. That is what this floor is for because, at the end of the day, we are going to have a vote. One side is going to win and one side is going to lose in this vote. And the debate is going to happen, and the bill is going to come forward. There will be another vote. And then it will go to the Senate. I disagree with my friend from Massachusetts, respect his opinion, but, in this case, I believe the debate is fairly clear to most Americans. All we are asking is, and what the current law already states, follow the rules. And all we are simply saying is, follow the rules. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FERGUSON ) laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, June 28, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2th) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on June 28, 2017, at 9:28 a.m.: Clerical correction to an appointment made on March 22, 2017 to the Board of Visitors of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. With best wishes, I am, Sincerely. KAREN L. H AAS. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1215. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 382 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1215. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1407 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1215) to improve patient access to health care services and provide improved medical care by reducing the excessive burden the liability system places on the health care delivery system, with Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the bill before us today is modeled on California’s highly successful litigation reforms that have lowered healthcare costs and made healthcare much more accessible to the people of that State. Because the evidence of the effects of those reforms on lowering healthcare costs is so overwhelming, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, if the same reforms were applied at the Federal level, they would save over $50 billion over a 10year period. Because the evidence that those reforms increase access to healthcare is so overwhelming, they are supported by a huge variety of public safety and labor unions, community clinics and health centers, and organizations dedicated to disease prevention, all of which have seen the beneficial effects of these reforms in California. So popular are these reforms among the citizens of California that a ballot initiative to raise the damages cap, backed and funded by trial lawyers, was defeated by an over 2to1 margin in 2014. This bill’s commonsense reforms include a $250,000 cap on inherently unquantifiable noneconomic damages and limits on the contingency fees lawyers can charge. They allow courts to require periodic payments for future damages instead of lump sum awards so bankruptcies in which plaintiffs would receive only pennies on the dollar can be prevented. They include provisions creating a ‘‘fair share’’ rule by which damages are allocated fairly in direct proportion to fault. This bill does all this without in any way limiting compensation for 100 percent of plaintiffs’ economic losses, which include anything to which a receipt can be attached, including all medical costs, lost wages, future lost wages, rehabilitation costs, and any other economic outofpocket loss suffered as the result of a healthcare injury. Far from limiting deserved recoveries in California, these reforms have led to medical damage awards in deserving cases in the $80 million and $90 million range. Unlike past iterations, this bill only applies to claims concerning the provision of goods or services for which coverage is provided in whole or in part via a Federal program, subsidy, or tax benefit, giving it a clear Federal nexus. Wherever Federal policy directly affects the distribution of healthcare, there is a clear Federal interest in reducing the costs of such Federal policies. The legislation before us today also protects any State law that otherwise caps damages—whether at a higher level or lower than the caps in the bill—or provides greater protections that lower healthcare costs. When President Ronald Reagan established a special task force to study the need for Federal tort reform, that task force concluded as follows: ‘‘In sum, tort law appears to be a major cause of the insurance availability and affordability crisis which the Federal Government can and should address in a variety of sensible and appropriate ways.’’ Indeed, the Reagan task force specifically recommended ‘‘eliminate joint and several liability,’’ ‘‘provide for periodic payments of future economic damages,’’ ‘‘schedule’’—that is, limit— ‘‘contingency fees’’ of attorneys, and ‘‘limit noneconomic damages to a fair and reasonable amount.’’ All of these recommended reforms are part of the bill before us today. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that would enact much needed commonsense and costsaving litigation reforms that would increase healthcare accessibility for all. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE , Washington, DC, March 21, 2017. Hon. BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN GOODLATTE : I write in regard to H.R. 1215, Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, which was referred in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I wanted to notify you that the Committee will forgo action on the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Committee on Energy and Commerce takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1215, the Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and will be appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves forward to address any remaining issues within the Committee’s jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any HouseSenate conference involving this or similar legislation and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 1215 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in your committee’s report on the legislation or the Congressional Record during its consideration on the House floor. Sincerely, GREGWALDEN , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY , Washington, DC, March 21, 2017. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN WALDEN : Thank you for consulting with the Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1215, the ‘‘Protecting Access to Care Act,’’ so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any HouseSenate conference on this legislation. I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1215 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work together as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman. 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1215 will do little to protect Americans’ access to safe and affordable healthcare. Instead, it will deny victims of medical malpractice and defective medical products the opportunity to be fully compensated for their injuries and to hold wrongdoers accountable. This legislation imposes various restrictions on lawsuits against healthcare providers concerning the provision of healthcare goods or services that would apply regardless of the merits of the case, the misconduct at issue, or the severity of the victim’s injury. There are so many problems with this bill, but to begin with, this bill would cause real harm by severely limiting the ability of victims to be made whole. For instance, the bill’s $250,000 aggregate limit for noneconomic damages, an amount established more than 
40 years ago pursuant to a California statute, would have a particularly adverse impact on women, children, the poor, and other vulnerable members of our society. These groups are more likely to receive noneconomic damages in healthcare cases because they are less able to establish lost wages and other economic losses. Women, for example, are often paid at a lower rate than men, even for the same job. Also, they are more likely to suffer noneconomic loss, such as disfigurement or loss of fertility. Imposing a severe limit on noneconomic damages, therefore, hurts them disproportionately. b1415 Finally, this bill is particularly harmful for veterans, members of the military, and their families. Because the bill prevents State tort law in any healthcarerelated lawsuit that includes any coverage provided by a Federal health program, all cases arising from substandard care received in a Veterans Administration facility or a military hospital would be subject to the bill’s restrictions. As a diverse coalition of veterans organizations noted in their letter of opposition, H.R. 1215 would limit the ability of veterans and military families to hold healthcare providers, drug manufacturers, and medical products providers accountable for pain and suffering and death that result from substandard care, preventable medical errors, and defective drugs and devices. For these and other reasons, I implore and urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 1215. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Today, in the Congress, too many Republicans and Democrats are obsessed with health insurance, often at the expense of the reforms that could reduce the cost of healthcare. If we cut the cost of healthcare, we make solutions far more attainable for affordable coverage. I support this tort reform legislation because it will make healthcare in America more accessible and less expensive. Defensive medicine costs Americans over $50 billion. Commonsense reform will eliminate these costs, help patients afford healthcare, all while reducing the Federal deficit. It is no surprise that defensive medicine costs so much. One survey recently reported that 93 percent of doctors practice defensive medicine due to a broken tort system. It is outrageous that we force doctors to subject patients to costly, unnecessary, and occasionally harmful tests just to avoid frivolous lawsuits. Let’s go back to performing medical tests when needed for the patient, not to simply avoid exposure in litigation for insurance companies. This will lower healthcare costs. The New England Journal of Medicine found that 1 in every 14 doctors gets sued each year. An earlier Harvard study revealed that 40 percent of these malpractice suits were groundless, yet over a quarter of these frivolous cases are settled, and the average payout was $300,000. Groundless cases overburden our legal system, making it harder for people with legitimate grievances to have their day in court. Frivolous claims drive up the cost of insurance for all healthcare providers, driving many physicians away from the healthcare profession. We need more doctors and hospitals, not less. Without reform, we get higher costs, fewer doctors, a larger Federal deficit, and worse healthcare outcomes. Let’s pass this bill and start delivering on more accessible healthcare for the American people. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ). Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member CONYERS for yielding me time. Mr. Chair, I share your grief over last night’s loss. Sorry about that. Mr. Chairman, this bill is a loss, too. It is a loss to people who have been injured by defective drugs, defective medical devices, been harmed in nursing homes, or been harmed by medical malpractice because it sets a cap on noneconomic damages of $250,000, no matter whom the person is, whatever their position was, no matter what damages they suffered. Trial lawyers aren’t the most liked people in America. They are a little bit above Congress people, I think, but it is right in there with used car salesmen. None of the three of us are doing real good. So it is easy to kind of beat us up. But people like their doctors. I see Dr. ROEover there. People like doctors. Doctors provide healthcare, if they are allowed to by Federal law and given the opportunity to get reimbursed and have a system. People don’t generally like trial lawyers. But the fact is, trial lawyers do a public service because they represent people. When they do it on contingency fees, they do it for people who wouldn’t have the money to hire a lawyer, necessarily, but have been harmed. And they go in on the idea that sometimes they will get nothing, but if they win, they get a contingency fee, and they give representation to people who otherwise couldn’t afford it. When they win, they win because a jury—which is like a little focus group of America—says there was a duty that the doctor breached and a harm done to the patient and the patient should be compensated. My chairman says this is just like California, and there he goes again with that Reagan stuff. Reagan was 40 years ago, I think, 35 years ago. Whatever. Californians thought this isn’t California’s law. This goes further than California on joint liability. The fact is, when you eliminate joint and several liability in certain places, a certain part of it is California, a certain part of it isn’t, it is less likely that the injured party is going to be able to collect. It goes further in terms of setting a statute of limitations, but the big picture is States’ rights. Normally, the folks on the other side of the aisle are all for States’ rights. They are for States’ rights when it comes to voting rights. They are for States’ rights when it comes to civil rights. They are for States’ rights on all kinds of things that generally tend to tamp down the lower economic folk in our country, particularly in the South. But here on medical malpractice, which has always been a province of the States, they want to usurp it and make a Federal standard that applies to everybody. If a State hasn’t set a cap on damages, then the Federal cap of $250,000 would go into place. So if you have a State that says it is unconstitutional to have a cap because you have got a right to a jury trial, then you might not be able to have that cap, and you will have this $250,000 cap set. There are all kinds of problems with Federalism, all kinds of problems with people who have been injured getting compensated, and other problems. Go Tigers. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ). Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for this opportunity. I have been sitting here listening very carefully to this debate. It sounds like a partisan fight. Democrats say this is a bad bill. Republicans say it is a good bill. If you are watching at home, you think: Here we go again. Just gridlock in Washington. Can’t get something done. Well, let me tell you and let me suggest that preserving and protecting access to care should not be a partisan issue. Why do I say that? I am from West Virginia, and 14 years ago we passed medical liability reform very similar to what we are getting ready to pass today, including $250,000 caps on noneconomic damages. Why do I know it was not a partisan issue back then is because the Governor of West Virginia who introduced the bill, House Bill 2122, was Congressman Governor Bob Wise. Bob Wise had been a Member of Congress for 18 years as a Democrat here in Congress. He introduced the bill 14 years ago in West Virginia. He signed the bill. It was his bill. The West Virginia Legislature, the House of Delegates, was 68 percent Democrat. The West Virginia Senate was 70 percent Democrat. A Democrat Legislature, a Democrat Governor, and the reform is just like what we are getting ready to pass today. 
Here is what Democrat Governor Bob Wise said about the bill and why they did it. What was the goal? ‘‘To work together towards a common goal preserving the healthcare system that serves all West Virginians.’’ What else did Governor Democrat Bob Wise say? He said, ‘‘This is a prime example of how government can work for the people,’’ when he passed this bill and signed it. On the day he signed the bill, this is what Democrat Bob Wise’s newsletter said: ‘‘My number one commitment is the health and safety of the citizens of West Virginia?’’ The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chair, this should not be a Democrat/ Republican issue. This should be an American healthcare issue. This should be preserving and protecting access to quality care. Just like Democrat Congressman Bob Wise in West Virginia 14 years ago set the example, we ought to set the example here of passing this with strong bipartisan support. This is quality care for the American citizens. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Yes, the previous speaker is right. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue, but the Republican Party in both houses has been doing its best to destroy healthcare for the American people in the last couple of months. This is just a different piece of the same plot. Bob Wise didn’t always have the best judgment. This cruel legislation does exactly the opposite of what its title states. It would place an artifical and very low cap on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases, and it would lock that figure into law without adjustment for inflation, which would reduce its value almost to zero over time. By capping damages, this bill would ensure that many victims of medical malpractice will not be fairly compensated for their injuries. Many other victims may be unable even to file a case in the first place because they will be unable to retain a lawyer. That is because medical malpractice cases often require significant upfront costs, as high as $100,000 on average, and few attorneys will take a case if the cap on damages means that there will be no reasonable likelihood of recouping their costs. This bill’s cap on noneconomic damages is particularly insidious because of its discriminatory effect on many women, children, and seniors. They often have little or no lost wages to calculate, and, therefore, they may recover very little in the form of economic damages. But they may still have suffered a real and lasting injury that deserves compensation. This includes women who may have chosen to stay home and raise a family, children who have yet to begin their careers, or seniors who have retired and left the workforce. Why should they be punished under this bill and get very little compensation for a lost limb or something else? The law recognizes that pain and suffering, and other noneconomic damages, are worthy of compensation, but supporters of this bill think Congress, not juries, should decide what those injuries are worth, and it is shamefully little. This legislation is based on the California law that includes a cap of $250,000 for noneconomic damages, but it was enacted back in 1975. Whether or not that was an appropriate figure 40 years ago, in today’s dollars, it is clearly inadequate. After adjusting for inflation, the cap would need to be approximately $1.128 million to be the same as the $250,000 cap was when it was enacted. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. NADLER. Thinking of it another way, that $250,000 cap is now worth just over $56,000, nearly a fifth as much. Even assuming that $250,000 is the appropriate figure today, fairness demands that this cap be indexed for inflation going forward so that we do not see a similar erosion of value. But this bill locks in an already low cap and lets it dwindle away until it is worth essentially zero. I offered an amendment to adjust the cap to reflect 40 years of inflation, and to index it going forward, but the Rules Committee did not make it in order. Instead, we are forced to vote on a bill that, over time, will consider pain and suffering to be worth nothing at all. This bill would not reduce the cost of malpractice insurance, it would not drive bad doctors out of practice, and it would certainly not protect patients. What it would do is give a free ride to a healthcare provider, or a healthcare entity, that seriously harms a patient or a consumer. I urge my colleagues to reject this unfair and unnecessary legislation. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE). Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, a much needed piece of legislation aimed at reforming medical malpractice law in order to help drive down the cost of providing healthcare and, thereby, making it more affordable for all Americans. I had the privilege of practicing medicine in the great State of Tennessee for 31 years before coming to Congress. The one thing that took away some of the joy from that practice was the threat of frivolous lawsuits. Because of trial attorneys, over the years, the premiums for malpractice insurance have ballooned to levels that make it difficult for providers to practice and are driving more people out of practice, away from small practices, and into large hospital systems just so they can survive as a practitioner. Worse still, the jury awards aren’t going to the victims of actual malpractice. b1430 In Tennessee, prior to implementing some malpractice reforms, over half the premium dollars were paid out to attorneys, and less than 40 cents of every dollar paid out have gone to people who have actually been injured. So we are not compensating the injured party. Thankfully, States like my home State of Tennessee are taking action and have enacted muchneeded reforms in the last decade, and the costs associated with providing care have plummeted since then. In 2008, the Tennessee Medical Malpractice Act was signed into law and created requirements that the plaintiff in a healthcare liability action provide the defendant with a presuit notice of the claim as well as a qualified expert to review the case and certify it has merit. Adding onto these reforms, in 2011, the Tennessee Civil Justice Act was signed into law, and it included a $750,000 cap for noneconomic damages and a cap on punitive damages at the greater of twice the compensatory damages or $500,000. With these changes, between 2008 and 2014, the number of medical malpractice lawsuits in Tennessee decreased by 36 percent, from 584 to just 374. And, Mr. Chairman, between 2009 and 2014, the annual medical malpractice premium for an OB/GYN doctor like myself decreased from $52,000 plus to $33,000plus, nearly a $20,000 decrease in premiums per year. Those of us who were here in 2009 when the Affordable Care Act was debated remember that President Obama acknowledged that the cost of defensive medicine was a bipartisan concern and something that he wanted to address. Despite the fact that our legislation is modeled on a California law that has stood the test for 40 years through both Republican and Democratic Governors, Democrats made no serious attempt to address medical malpractice as their healthcare bill was pushed through, which is yet another flaw of the ACA. Today’s bill is common sense. With these reforms, we will ensure patients, not trial attorneys, are compensated for legitimate malpractice claims—and there are legitimate claims out there. But we will also prevent frivolous litigation from moving forward. For those concerned about the 10th Amendment, this bill respects States’ rights and only subjects claims with a Federal nexus to this law, while giving a great deal of latitude to States to act in their own accord. 
Mr. Chairman, I loved what I did while I was in practice. I had the chance to deliver about 5,000 babies, and it never felt like a job. It is just what I did and enjoyed doing. But at a time when healthcare costs are spiraling out of control, an easy fix like H.R. 1215 just makes sense and is just another piece of the puzzle to help the costs of healthcare go down. I strongly support the muchneeded reforms in this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of final passage. One final thing, Mr. Chairman. I have a list here of our premiums in the State of Tennessee, and under every specialty listed here—and there are numerous—there were dramatic decreases in each of these. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), the most active Member in the 115th Congress. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I would say to my colleagues that this is about bad medicine, not good medicine, and it is about undermining good healthcare, as we have seen in the TrumpCare saga, causing some 49 million people to lose their insurance. Here we go again. I would offer to say that the most difficult, hurtful, and harmful aspect of this particular legislation is that it would make it more difficult for plaintiffs to seek redress for medical injuries that have been proven in court. In addition, it proposes to make dangerous and potentially unconstitutional changes to our Nation’s Federal system, intruding on State sovereignty, the very thing that Republicans seem to relish and to support, because this bill attempts to preempt the several areas of tort law that have been traditionally reserved to the States. I would tell my good friends in Tennessee and West Virginia: Deal with your States, just as other individuals deal with their own States. This bill, as well, has a very difficult impact on medical malpractice. Because it was written so vaguely, the broad language sweeps into not only doctors and other medical professionals, but hospitals and clinics and almost every entity that contributes in any way to making any healthcare product or service available. That clearly impacts the healthcare of Americans. When your child is injured through no fault of their own or your own, you need relief for that child. Interestingly enough, the American Bar Association that represents all lawyers, trial lawyers, of which there is an attempt to impugn their work, contempt for trial lawyers and the good work that they do. But the ABA says they are opposed to this bill, and they represent lawyers who fight every day to make sure the injustices don’t happen. But here is the real cause of my angst for this particular bill: ‘‘Medical Error Leaves Family With Unanswered Questions.’’ ‘‘Olivia was a senior in high school in Santa Monica, California, an accomplished scholar, actress, and musician who had earned early acceptance to Smith College.’’ The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. JACKSON LEE. ‘‘Olivia was born with a congenital heart condition.’’ She was going into college, but had a condition that caused her to go into the hospital. When she went in, she had a small procedure. Her vitals were dropping. Hospital staff waited more than 10 minutes before attempting resuscitation, but it was too late. She remained in a coma and died. Mr. Chairman, I include the article in the RECORD . 
MEDICAL ERROR LEAVES FAMILY WITH UNANSWERED QUESTIONS  Research has found that 440,000 Americans die every year from preventable medical errors each year. Olivia was a senior in high school in Santa Monica, California, an accomplished scholar, actress, and musician who had earned early acceptance to Smith College. Olivia was born with a congenital heart condition that was monitored throughout her childhood. The fall that Olivia was supposed to start college, she underwent a routine procedure to help doctors figure out if she could be considered for a surgery that would improve her condition. The procedure was completed without complications, but while Olivia was still under anesthesia, a cardiology fellowintraining pulled the catheter lines, causing Olivia’s heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure to drop rapidly. Even though her vitals were dropping, hospital staff waited more than 10 minutes before attempting resuscitation. But it was too late. Olivia would never regain consciousness and died that winter, never having lived her dream and attending college. Her future was stolen from her, and immediately her family tried to understand what had gone wrong. They began to ask questions on how this could have happened, but they were given very few answers from the hospital. Finally, the hospital gave her family incomplete medical records to sift through and find answers. They sought the help of an attorney because, despite their best efforts, they still did not fully understand what caused their daughter’s death. But due to California’s out dated $250,000 cap on medical negligence damages, it was nearly impossible to find one. Olivia’s life was cut short by a preventable medical error, and unfortunately, she is not alone. In the U.S., preventable medical errors are the third leading cause of death. Our focus should be on improving patient safety and preventing medical errors, not limiting the rights of injured patients and their families. Lawmakers who seek to limit the accountability of health care providers are seeking to limit our rights and our avenues to justice. Don’t our loved ones deserve better? 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, what do you want families to face—no relief? Or do you want these constant errors to go unrecognized and reconciled? This bill will do that by denying the ability. It provides immunity for healthcare providers who dispense defective or dangerous products. It makes it harder for victims to attain adequate legal representation, and it imposes a risk or loss on victims rather than wrongdoers. This bill undermines healthcare and it undermines good healthcare. Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a letter from the American Bar Association opposing this bill. 
Mr. CHAIR, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1215, the socalled ‘‘Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017.’’ I oppose this misguided and illconsidered legislation for several reasons. Specifically, the bill before us should be rejected because: 1. H.R. 1215 violates state sovereignty; 2. H.R. 1215 applies well beyond medical malpractice; 3. Unjustifiably caps noneconomic damages, which will have a disproportionately adverse impact on women, the poor, and other vulnerable groups. 4. Provides unjustifiable immunity for health care providers who dispense defective or dangerous pharmaceuticals or medical devices; 5. Imposes an excessively short statute of limitations period; 6. Makes it harder for victims to obtain adequate legal representation; and 7. Inequitably imposes the risk of loss on victims rather than wrongdoers. For over 200 years, the authority to determine medical liability has rested in the states. This system, which grants each state the autonomy to regulate the resolution of medical liability actions within its own borders, is a hallmark of our American justice system. H.R. 1215 would preempt state law in all 50 states with a rigid, uniform set of rules designed to make it more difficult for malpractice victims to obtain relief in the courts. Victims injured by the negligent conduct of others, who have lost limbs, suffered traumatic brain injury, or lost their vision following medical procedures should not be subject to additional burdens of a possible limited recovery, currently available under state patients’ bills of rights and other protections under the Affordable Care Act. The definitions in H.R. 1215 are written in such vague and broad language as to potentially sweep in not only doctors and other medical professionals, hospitals and clinics, but also every entity that contributes in any way to making any health care product or service available, including insurance companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, health product manufacturers, pharmacists, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and mental health treatment centers, and drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, among others. H.R. 1215 will do nothing to strengthen protections for patients. It goes in the opposite direction, by excusing the health care industry from accountability for carelessness, and shifting the burden for shouldering the consequences of preventable medical injury to the injured patients, their families, their employers, their insurance companies, and taxpayers. Current provisions of the Affordable Care Act prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage for preexisting conditions, mandate coverage for young adults and children under the age of 26, and secure lifetime coverage caps, ensuring patients receive the care they need. Empirical research has shown that caps on damages, such as those envisioned by H.R. 1215, diminish access to the courts for the most vulnerable, such as low wage earners, like the elderly, children, and women. The bill arbitrarily caps socalled ‘‘noneconomic loss’’—which sweeps in essentially everything that is not loss of salary or additional medical expenses—at $250,000 for the patient’s lifetime, punishing those patients with the most devastating, lifealtering injuries. The bill forces the injured patient to take the amounts received for future expenses resulting from the injury in a ‘‘structured settlement,’’ which may not match up with the patient’s actual needs as they arise, and would further reduce the amount the careless health care provider actually pays. Preventable medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States, with an estimated 440,000 deaths each year following a medical error or hospitalcaused infection during a hospital stay. Addressing this problem must be a national priority. And although policies to promote and require safer practices are key to this effort, that is insufficient. We cannot assign a government monitor to every hospital operating room and every doctor’s office. Effective protection should also include enabling patients and their families to hold health care providers accountable for errors that cause harm. H.R. 1215 would unfortunately take several major steps backward from this goal. The bill twists important protections found in many state laws into an additional legal hurdle. An extended statute of limitations protection allows patients who do not discover their injury until much later, sometimes many years after the medical procedure or intervention, to still have a change to seek legal help. But in the bill, the period in which an injured patient can seek legal help is actually shortened to one year. The bill cuts off a patient injured as a young child if their family fails to bring legal action on their behalf, long before they are old enough to legally act on their own behalf. This legislation would impose various restrictions on medical malpractice lawsuits, causing these restrictions to apply regardless of how much merit a case may have, the negligence at issue, or the severity of the issue. If economic damages are minor and noneconomic damages are capped, victims are less likely to be able to obtain counsel to represent them in seeking redress in these personal injury malpractice cases that often operate under contingency fee. Those affected by caps on damages are the patients who have been most severely injured by the negligence of others. These patients who reside in communities around the country should not be told that, due to an arbitrary limit set by members of Congress in Washington, DC, they will be deprived of the compensation determined by a fair and impartial jury. The courts already possess and exercise their powers of remittitur to set aside excessive jury verdicts, and that is the appropriate solution rather than an arbitrary cap. I am concerned that H.R. 1215 would put patient safety at higher risk, by significantly undermining the accountability of those who provide patients with medical care. H.R. 1215 undercuts patients in situations in which carelessness or misconduct by several health care providers combines to injure the patient. It arbitrarily ‘‘divides’’ blame among those actors and then if one of them evades accountability for any reason, the others who caused the injury are excused from having to make up the difference, and the injured patient is shortchanged. 
H.R. 1215 shifts accountability away from the careless health care providers who caused the injury and onto ‘‘collateral sources,’’ such as the patient’s insurance company or employer, or the government, that pay for part of the patient’s medical expenses or other expenses resulting from the injury. In effect, these other sources provide involuntary free insurance to careless health care providers. The bill excuses doctors and other health care providers from any responsibility of looking into the safety and effectiveness of any medication or medical product, so long as it has been approved by the FDA. Accordingly, I strongly oppose H.R. 1215 for these and many more reasons and urge my colleagues to reject this bill. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman, first of all, the statement that this bill caps or limits States on economic or noneconomic damages is incorrect. In fact, I would point the gentlewoman from Texas to page 6 of the bill, that says, under State Flexibility, that specifies a particular monetary amount of economic or economic damages, there is no provision in this section that shall be construed to preempt State law. We wrote that specifically to respect the States’ rights. I recall a number of these pieces of legislation that have come before this Congress. I can remember it back at least until 2007. I was uneasy about the constitutionality because it did reach in and preempt State law. And I am a respecter of States’ rights, but we have a Federal interest in healthcare. That is the provision that is written into the bill. If there are Federal dollars involved, if it is a Federal program, then the Federal Government has an interest in limiting these damages. We capped the damages in this bill, not the economic damages. Those real damages that are economic damages are fully compensated, without limit, without cap, and without the interference of this law, unless States choose to cap economic damages. Noneconomic damages, however, are capped at $250,000; and that $250,000 cap is something that has existed in California State law for more than 40 years, signed into law by the very durable Jerry Brown. But if the States want to change that, if they want to raise the cap beyond $250,000, that is their right to do so. We specify that in the bill. I would like to discuss a need for this bill. It is necessary to preserve fiscal sanity in Federal healthcare policy. And I would like to point out, also, at the outset that this bill only applies to claims concerning the provision of goods and services for which coverage is provided in whole or in part by a Federal program, a Federal subsidy, or a Federal tax benefit. It is a clear, clear, Mr. Chairman, Federal nexus. Wherever Federal policy affects the distribution of healthcare, there is a clear Federal interest. So, the bill’s commonsense reforms, which have been the law in California for over 40 years and that the CBO has scored a couple of times here—the previous score was $54 billion; this score is $50 billion—is over $50 billion in savings to the people who are paying for healthcare in this country, and that includes our taxpayers and the healthcare users. But the $250,000 cap is reasonable. It has sustained itself over those 40 years in California, and it is good enough for other States to emulate. When I hear some pushback from Texas, I am kind of thinking they want to keep the system they have, and they don’t want to have to compete with the rest of the country. I think we might lose a vote or two to from Texas on that alone: We have ours; we don’t want America to have anything like that because then we have to compete with all of America. This bill will allow courts to require periodic payments for future damages instead of lump sum awards. That helps limit bankruptcies so plaintiffs that might receive only pennies on the dollar can be prevented. And it includes provisions creating a ‘‘fair share’’ rule by which damages are allocated fairly in direct proportion to fault. That has got to help a lot when you are thinking about the cost of healthcare. The bill does all this without in any way limiting compensation for 100 percent of the plaintiffs’ economic losses, which include anything to which a receipt can be attached, including all medical costs, lost wages, future lost wages, rehabilitation costs, or any other economic outofpocket loss suffered as a result of a healthcare injury. Far from limiting deserved recoveries in California, these reforms have led to medical damage awards in deserving cases, Mr. Chairman, in the area of the $80 million to $90 million range. The Washington Post reported a few months ago: ‘‘U.S. healthcare spending . . . is projected to accelerate over the next decade. . . . A study by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects that the average growth in health spending will be even faster in 2016’’ on up through the decade of 2025. ‘‘The projections are based on an assumption that the legislative status quo will prevail.’’ If we don’t change the law, we are going to see these costs going up. As Nate Silver pointed out in The New York Times, not my favorite document: ‘‘All the major categories of Federal Government spending have been increasing relative to inflation. But essentially all of the increase in spending relative to economic growth and the potential tax base has come from entitlement programs, and about half of all of that has come from healthcare entitlements specifically.’’ Studies show that as healthcare costs rise, wages fall; and the more companies pay in healthcare costs, the less they can pay in wages. So when healthcare costs increase and that growth increases, wages stagnate; and when healthcare costs growth slows, wages go up. Members who want to see wages increase should vote for this bill—it is good for the healthcare workers—because one of the drivers of higher healthcare spending is socalled defensive medicine. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself an additional 2 minutes. That is a very real phenomenon confirmed by countless studies in which healthcare workers conduct many additional costly tests and procedures with no medical value. That is charged to our Federal taxpayers, and it is simply to avoid excessive litigation costs. A survey published in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that 91 percent of the over 1,000 doctors surveyed ‘‘reported believing that physicians order more tests and procedures than needed to protect themselves from malpractices suits.’’ The study also asked: ‘‘Are protections against unwarranted medical malpractice lawsuits needed to decrease the unnecessary use of diagnostic tests?’’ And the answer, an identical number: 91 percent of the doctors surveyed agreed. But there is one Newsweek reporter who described the personal experience of individual doctors this way: ‘‘Typical was one doctor, who had a list as long as my arm of procedures ER docs perform . . . for no patient benefit. They include following a bedside sonogram . . . with an ‘‘official’’ sonogram because it’s easier to defend yourself to a jury if you’ve ordered the second one; a CT scan for every child who bumped his or her head, to rule out things that can be diagnosed just fine by observation; Xrays that do not guide treatment, such as for a simple broken arm; CTs for suspected appendicitis that has been perfectly well diagnosed without it. ‘‘Although doctors may hate practicing defensive medicine, they do it so they don’t get sued. . . . Nationwide, physicians estimate that 35 percent of diagnostic tests they ordered were to avoid lawsuits, as were 19 percent of hospitalizations, 14 percent of prescriptions, and 8 percent of surgeries. . . . All told,’’ according to the Newsweek article, $650 billion in unnecessary care every year was provided by these doctors. Another ER doctor said he ordered 52 CT scans in one 12hour shift for a total of $104,000 in a single day. These are the things we are dealing with, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself an additional 1 minute. One of the most recent studies, published a few months ago in the Journal of the American College of Radiology studied the effects of tort reform on 
just radiographic tests alone and found that there were ‘‘2.4 million to 2.7 million fewer radiographic tests annually attributed to tort reforms.’’ Just imagine what savings would occur if such reforms were attached to all Federal healthcare programs, as this bill would do. b1445 It causes me to think of an orthopedic surgeon who told me that he can diagnose an ACL almost every time, yet he is compelled by his liability insurance to do additional tests, 97 percent of which are unnecessary. That is the kind of thing we are dealing with, Mr. Chairman, and it is time for us to bring sanity to this litigation that we have in this country. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman very much. I think the question to the gentleman from Michigan, and the gentleman’s comments from Iowa, is the question of good medicine, and additional tests may, frankly, just be good medicine. Maybe, Mr. Chair, Mr. CONYERS  would agree that we should gather about insurance reform and capping premiums so that we can help our doctors. And I would assure you that they would be very happy on that. But to the gentleman’s point, I’m sorry to say he was incorrect, because we note that there are almost 20 States that have a variety of noncaps on certain aspects, and now the Federal intrusion will come in and now tell them where they do not have caps, that they have to have caps. In fact, he is incorrect, and this bill does skew the medical service or medical treatment in our States. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1215, which should be more accurately called the taking away access to care and justice act. This bill will do nothing to strengthen patient protections and will make careless healthcare providers less accountable. It will severely limit when an injured person is allowed to bring a healthcare lawsuit by shortening the time that injured people have to seek relief. It will also impose a onesizefitsall cap on how much compensation victims of medical malpractice can receive for pain and suffering, regardless of the severity of a person’s injury—in order to benefit insurance companies and wrongdoers. This cap even applies to intentional acts of misconduct. This bill would unfairly limit a patient suing a healthcare provider for sexual assault, as well as a veteran who has received substandard medical care. The bill is written so broadly, it shields both negligent doctors and manufacturers of dangerous drugs and medical devices from liability. H.R. 1215 is before us at a time when Republicans in the Senate are working hard to pass a bill that eliminates health coverage for 22 million people in order to give the wealthiest Americans and insurance companies a huge tax cut. The American people deserve better than this. Our legal and healthcare system should work for the benefit of hardworking Americans, the people we represent, not for the powerful special interests. Republicans are chomping at the bit for the opportunity to eliminate health coverage for honest, hardworking Americans and are making deep cuts to Medicaid just so they can give the richest people in this country a $600 billion tax cut. And now, they want to prevent injured people from getting justice when they are hurt. Middle class families need to see that we are on their side. They don’t need bills like H.R. 1215, which will rig the healthcare and justice systems against them. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1215. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, it is just interesting to me to hear this discussion about the Senate addressing the healthcare situation in America. I stood on this floor time, after time, after time, and in 2010, March 23 of 2010, the final passage of ObamaCare was sent out of the Congress to the President of the United States, who signed it immediately before the sun could come up in the morning. And I was sick at heart at what happened to our Constitution, our rule of law, our individual rights. And now we have a mess of a healthcare system in America. This is a component of the fix. We don’t have a single Democrat in the House or Senate that is willing to even commit to work with us to put up a single vote to try to improve the healthcare system in America. They made a mistake, and they passed ObamaCare. They served it over to us and said: Now you fix it. Well, we are going to declare it a mess no matter what you do. We are going to fix it. It is going to take some time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ), a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chair, I thank my friend, the ranking member from Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I am thrilled to hear my colleague talk about the Constitution. I am sorry that the Constitution that he is talking about doesn’t include the right to a jury trial because that is the Constitution that I read. And this piece of legislation, H.R. 1215, will threaten that constitutional right. We have been told there is nothing to worry about in this bill because it will cover 100 percent of economic costs—anything that comes with a receipt, we were told. I am going to tell you what is wrong with this bill and the stories of four people: a young child who goes in for a simple procedure and leaves the hospital paralyzed; a young adult who requires the amputation of his left leg, but the doctor amputates the right leg and he leaves the hospital with neither; the woman whose physician used his power to sexually assault her while she is sedated; and the rape of a nursing home patient by a trusted healthcare provider. Mr. Chairman, there will be no receipts that will cover the costs that those four individuals would suffer for the rest of their lives that could be turned in, compensated, and subject to this artificial cap. Why is it that my colleagues believe that they are in a better position to determine how those wronged individuals should be compensated for the atrocities that happened to them instead of allowing a jury of their peers do the same? This bill is not meant to help reduce costs. This is an assault on injured people. This is an assault on those who value access to the courtroom in order to see justice. I urge my colleagues, in the strongest possible terms, to reject this anticonsumer, this terrible piece of legislation. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, as you listen to the stories that are here that have been delivered by the gentleman from Florida, I am wondering why we haven’t heard these stories come out of California. Because this legislation essentially mirrors California legislation. That was the model that we followed. And they have had over 40 years to repeal or amendment it, and it has been sustainable. There is a right to a jury trial under this. It is just that there are caps that are set, that are reasonable caps, and the States are free to change those caps up or down. So I don’t quite follow this, but I would say someone who is raped in a nursing home is not covered under this. This legislation doesn’t affect it at all. It has to have an affect by a diagnosis, a prevention, or a treatment of a disease impairment; and a rape is not that. So it would not be covered under this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I know that my opposition would like to have this legislation killed. I would just point out something that I heard on the floor of the House here about 10 years ago, and it was this: We can pass this legislation, but the Senate may not pass it. And I would urge them to take it up. There is a special interest, and it is the Trial Lawyers Association. They are the ones who will not come out of this very well. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ). Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. As the House Liberty Caucus wrote, this bill violates the 10th Amendment that conservatives have always supported. More troubling is the way this bill is worded. It could lead to what the Liberty Caucus describes as a ‘‘massive expansion of Federal authority’’ because it could make almost every medical malpractice case a Federal case. Every case should not be a Federal case. The States have already put pretty severe limits on medical malpractice cases. I have two other problems with this bill. I am in my 29th year in Congress. The doctors were asking for this $250,000 limit then, too. $250,000 29 years ago is certainly not $250,000 today. Finally, this bill, in the end, is saying there are really no limits on suits against 99.8 percent of the people I represent, but we are going to have special protection for this one very respected group of people. Conservatives have traditionally had more faith in people than in government. I was a judge for 7.5 years before coming to Congress. Conservatives used to believe strongly in the jury system, and still should believe in that today. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, I point out also that this bill keeps these cases in State court. It doesn’t move them to Federal court. Previous legislation that has been brought to this floor, a decade or so ago, did move a lot of these cases to Federal court. But it is carefully drafted to keep this with the maximum amount of respect for States’ rights that can be held and still have a Federal interest. There has to be a Federal interest in every dollar involved in this. In every single case, there has to be Federal dollars involved in it, or this bill wouldn’t affect it at all. And so I am one who is also a great respecter of States’ rights. And in this legislation, as drafted, there are provisions in there over and over again that protect as many of the States’ rights as can be. And if you take the other side of this argument, then it is far stronger that the right of the Federal Government would be usurped by the States if we don’t have this legislation. That is what is taking place now— States that choose not to make a decision, not to set caps, and we are seeing huge settlements going on around the country. This is what we want to end, so that we can save the $50 to $54 billion for the taxpayers. But the thing that is even worth more than this is, how much of that $650 billion in defensive medicine will no longer be used in this country, and how much safer and less expensive will our healthcare be in America? I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just have to add here that H.R. 1215 deeply intrudes on States’ sovereignty. In particular, H.R. 1215 preempts State law governing joint and several liability, the availability of damages, the ability to introduce evidence of collateral source benefits, attorneys’ fees, and periodic payments of future damages. Members should not be fooled by assertions that the bill preserves State law. In fact, the rule of construction contained in the bill expressly states that it preempts State law, except in very limited circumstances where State law is more favorable to defendants. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ). Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, I rise today to express my strong opposition to H.R. 1215. First of all, my home State of Washington is one of those States where our Supreme Court has ruled and said that caps are not constitutional. So this bill is an intrusion of our States’ rights. This bill also clearly puts the interests of big corporations over everyday people and sends a signal to medical and health providers that they can act irresponsibly, perhaps to make more money, and get away with it. Let me give you a very real example of what happens when hospitals put profit over people. The neurology program at Swedish Medical CenterCherry Hill in Seattle is under investigation for negligent care arising out of a program designed to incentivize neuroscience doctors to take on heavy caseloads of complicated cases that lead to serious errors and even death. One of the patients was Talia Goldenberg, a talented and vibrant young woman. Talia went in for a cervical spinal fusion with a neurosurgeon who had been embroiled in numerous investigations. And as a result of gross medical malpractice, Talia died. According to a Seattle Times investigation, numerous problems surfaced around her care—or lack thereof—and attention to the surgery and medical complications that arose from it. When Talia went in for her surgery, she was filled with hope. In thinking about the life that she might have after surgery, she wrote this: So who am I? I am an artist, a dreamer. I am a stationary biker. I am a woman, a girl, a person. I am a skier. I am an aspiring pole vaulter. I am a reluctant, yet faithful, believer of the power of lucky underwear. I am someone with a voice. Talia died. She is one of the many tragic instances of people losing their lives to medical malpractice, and, even in my own office, two of my staffers have lost three of their grandparents due to medical malpractice. We have to make sure that we have consequences when we entrust our healthcare to someone, and there are grave errors. For the sake of Talia and so many others like her who have dreams that are violated by preventable errors, we must defeat this bill. A ‘‘no’’ vote is a vote for the American people. b1500 Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, I was a little surprised to hear that a judge in the State of Washington had ruled that caps are unconstitutional. In fact, it is kind of curious to hear the same arguments—or conflicting arguments coming out of the other side. One of them says it is the States’ rights to be able to set the caps. The other one says it is unconstitutional to set the caps. So I think that conflict, it would be good if that were resolved. I think, in either case, that I disagree with both of those positions, Mr. Chairman. If a Washington State judge says caps are unconstitutional, on what basis? That would say, then, that a State legislature couldn’t cap them; Congress can’t cap them; that this is essentially, then, a function of the courts. I remember a decision that came out of the State of Washington. It was a Federal judge that essentially ruled that the President’s executive order on, let’s say, migrants coming into the United States was unconstitutional, even though Congress specifically granted the authority to their President. So I am not going to defer to a single judge’s opinion in that fashion. I would point out, too, that we do protect States’ rights. There is provision in this bill after provision, and it is titled State Flexibility. Look through their and find all the provisions of State Flexibility where we respect States’ rights. And it is written as carefully as it can be to respect the maximum amount of States’ rights. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ). Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, let’s be clear: this bill has nothing to do with litigation reform. It has nothing to do with a good faith attempt to improve our healthcare system. In fact, this bill was described as phase 3 of an effort to improve our healthcare by the majority leader on the other side of the aisle. I put out a search committee. I still can’t find phase 1 or phase 2. It has nothing to do with reforming our healthcare system. This bill is an unprecedented attack on States’ rights. It is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It is a solution in search of a problem. It is nothing more than a reckless legislative joyride guaranteed to crash and burn on the American people. 
This bill, if enacted, will hurt working families, middle class people, senior citizens, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, veterans, and nursing home residents. The American people deserve a litigation system that works for everyone, not simply the wealthy and the well off. The American people deserve a litigation system that puts the public’s interest ahead of special interests. The American people deserve a litigation system that promotes public health, not just excessive wealth. This bill fails on all of those counts. It is meanspirited, it is cruel, it is heartless. Mr. Chairman, that is why it must be defeated. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds. I would just point out to the body that I didn’t hear a single fact in the previous 2 minutes. It is all opinion and hurled accusations. But I think it is important for this body to deliberate over the facts themselves, and I have delivered a lot of that data. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, the floor leader has invited us to stick to the facts, so I want to stick to the facts in order to clear up some of the propaganda I have heard today for this terrible bill. First of all, it has nothing to do with ‘‘groundless cases or frivolous claims,’’ because the draconian new limits proposed in their legislation applied only to valid claims in serious cases. It has nothing to do with groundless cases and frivolous claims. That is an irrelevant distraction from their own legislation, which is an attempt to reduce what you can recover with a perfectly valid claim when a jury has awarded you damages. Number two, the floor leader says that it would not apply in the case of someone being raped in a nursing home. Perhaps he thinks it wouldn’t apply to my constituent, a 15yearold girl who got raped by her dentist. But as I read the bill, it says, ‘‘healthcare lawsuit means any action against a healthcare provider,’’ and that includes anyone who is providing healthcare. So if a nursing home is providing healthcare or a dentist is providing healthcare, they would be covered by the law. But I would invite the floor leader to clear this up, because if he is representing now that rapes of patients in a nursing home or in a dentist’s office don’t count, that should be definitive legislative history that we establish today because we tried to amend the bill to that effect in committee and the majority voted it down. But he has just represented that a rape would not count, and I want him to definitively commit whether or not a rape by a healthcare provider would count. Finally, the gentleman from Iowa says it won’t preempt the States, it will not impose Federal laws because it is still in the State courts. It is still in the State courts, but Federal law now applies. There are 28 States which have said that you cannot limit people’s access to noneconomic damages when a jury wants to award them those damages for pain and suffering. They have either said in their Constitution there can be no limits at all, or the legislatures have said it, or the State supreme courts have struck it down. And their legislation is a bulldozer that will run over the laws of 28 States. And they claim, Mr. Chairman, that somehow they are acting in the guise of federalism. They are destroying federalism. That is why I was so happy that Mr. DUNCAN , a former State Judge from Tennessee, and a member of the GOP majority, got up to say this is antithetical to everything they stand for. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, I would point out, first of all, the gentleman from Maryland must know that this isn’t a criminal statute. This is civil law. It doesn’t have anything to do with crime or criminal law, so let’s keep our discussion to the civil actions that we are discussing here. It is not propaganda. It is facts that we have delivered on this side. So I want to put this into the RECORD verbatim, Mr. Chairman. Regarding cases of rape or physical abuse, H.R. 1215 does not cover such cases at all. That is because the bill only applies to medical malpractice claims based on the provision or use of healthcare services; and healthcare services are defined in the bill as things related to the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any human disease or impairment. Clearly, rape or any other physical abuse, and the neglect of basic sanitary conditions, is not related to the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any human disease or impairment. So in cases involving rape or physical abuse by anyone, or neglect of basic needs, the bill simply does not apply. But it does respect States’ rights. It is carefully written to protect States’ rights. It is a significant and huge improvement upon some efforts we have seen in the past, and one of those reasons is because many of us care about States’ rights, and we pay attention to the Constitution. There is a Federal nexus in everything that goes on here, and States are not limited from raising caps on economic or noneconomic damages or lowering those caps. We respect the States in every way possible, and still get a positive result out of H.R. 1215. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, first of all, there are only three States in the Union that set the limit where they want Congress to set it for every State, which is $250,000. They are overriding the laws of 28 States which allow for unlimited damages. Number two, the gentleman from Iowa says: Well, a rape is criminal, so it is not related. But you can bring civil actions against the same conduct that constitutes a crime. So if you look at your own bill, it says any theory of liability, so that would include intentional acts. Now, again, Mr. Chairman, is the majority representing that this will not apply to intentional torts? Because they were very definitive in committee that it would apply to intentional torts, including rapes and assaults. So I would like to know: Does it apply or does it not? Because this is a critical matter, because people have been—we are not talking about the good doctors. Everybody loves the good doctors. We are talking about doctors or nursing home providers or dentists who rape their patients and assault their patients. They would be limited—juries could try to give millions of dollars, but their legislation would limit you to $250,000 in noneconomic damages. We have got to clear this up, Mr. Chairman. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ). Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1215, a misguided and misnamed bill that will limit access to justice, especially for women. The bill caps the amount of compensation a jury can award to a victim who suffers medical injuries, even catastrophic injuries, because it creates a lifetime cap of $250,000 for noneconomic damages. This means that women, or men, for that matter, who are at home raising their families, or children who are victims of devastating medical malpractice are told that the value of their injuries and their lives is less than that of their wageearning counterparts. That is patently unfair. It disproportionately penalizes people who are family caregivers—a very important job, but one that does not involve wages. Furthermore, many women across the country have been victims of medical malpractice that has left them unable to bear children. How can we say to these women that the loss they have suffered, the loss of an opportunity to be a mother is without value? That is unacceptable, and it is cruel. Many medical errors are preventable. We should be focusing on improving patient safety, not taking away rights from victims. I oppose this bill, and I will continue to fight back against attempts to limit access to justice for those who need it most. Please join me in voting ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, I have heard the gentleman from Maryland say that this legislation would override the laws of 28 States. That was a surprise to me to hear that when I heard the number before Rules Committee, which I think I actually recall it was 27. But 28, 27, it doesn’t override laws. It is the absence of laws. There are States that don’t have caps. That is what we are talking about here. So it is not overriding State laws in States where there are no laws. It simply is setting a Federal foundation and a guideline for them. And if I am in a State legislature, I know I have the authority to raise or lower the cap on economic and on noneconomic damages, and that my laws are not being overridden, but they are being provided by the wisdom of the American people, then I am going to be thankful I have that to work with until I can amend it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I refer my colleague, the floor leader on the other side to section 9 of the bill. We have just looked at it. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BARRAGA ´N). Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1215 and to express my extreme concerns with this bill. I am from California, and I am an attorney, and I can tell you that this bill goes beyond medical malpractice. It goes way beyond that. It includes cases involving unsafe drugs and nursing home abuse and neglect. That is not happening in California. If passed, it would prevent cases where seniors have endured tragic deaths and injuries, like an 88yearold California woman who was sexually assaulted by her nursing assistant after she suffered a stroke, resulting in lifelong mental and physical pain. Over 80 senior and healthcare groups, including the American Association for Justice and the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, have come out against this bill. They recognize that we need to protect our vulnerable seniors. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ). Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, here we are dealing with some amount of irony with H.R. 1215. The year 1215 was the year the Magna Carta was signed, something that created the seeds of the American right to jury trial, for Heaven’s sake. You know, we were pleased to hear Representative DUNCAN from Tennessee say: ‘‘Conservatives believe strongly in the jury system.’’ And I do, too, and Americans do, too. Our Founding Fathers believed in it. Here in America, where we trust juries to decide life and death for criminal defendants, why wouldn’t we trust them to set a proper and fair dollar amount on a malpractice case? By definition, these are meritorious cases, cases where there was actual negligence, actual recklessness, actual intentional harm by healthcare providers or nursing homes. b1515 But maybe most importantly, none of us, nary a soul in this House would deny that standing up for veterans and our military families is a core value for all of us. This is a bill that prevents accountability for harm done to military and veterans of the VA system. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. CONYERS very much for yielding. The good gentleman from Iowa invites us to believe that the laws of the States are not being overridden because some of these States don’t have laws. That’s right, because their State supreme courts have said that their constitutions forbid the imposition of a cap on what juries would award people who are injured in medical cases. So, in Arizona, Arkansas, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming, there are State constitutional prohibitions explicitly on damage caps. In New York and Oklahoma, there are explicit caps on damages in wrongful death cases. And in 11 States, State supreme courts have struck down statutorily enacted medical malpractice damage caps: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. Now, what is interesting in my State, the 15yearold girl who was raped by her dentist could recover up to $785,000 because we had a whole special session of our general assembly to arrive at that figure. But there are other States where they said you can’t have any limits at all, and those are the States that are being attacked by this legislation because now they are reducing them from potentially $20 million or $10 million to $200,000, an outrageous invasion in states’ rights and the rights of juries to decide how people need to be compensated. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Numerous consumer, labor, veterans, and legal groups all oppose H.R. 1215, including the AFL–CIO, the American College of Physicians, the Consumers Union, Public Citizen, Vietnam Veterans of America, 12 other national veterans organizations, and the Liberty Caucus. H.R. 1215 is an extremely flawed bill that will deny access to justice for victims of medical malpractice and especially those who are the most vulnerable among us. It would deny full compensation for injuries suffered by veterans and military families, children, the elderly, and the poor. I hope my colleagues will join us in opposing this very unnecessary, mean spirited bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I inquire as to the amount of time I have remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Iowa has 41⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. First, I say in response to the gentleman from Maryland’s discussion about the States courts that have prohibited caps. That is one of the reasons that we need this legislation, is that you have outofcontrol liberal judges that have decided that even their State legislatures can’t pass the laws. They want to come in and preempt the states’ rights of we, the people, of the individual States who elect their general assemblies to make their decisions. Often, the judges are set in lifetime appointments where they are not held accountable, so it would be interesting to look back into each of these States that the gentleman from Maryland has mentioned and address this thing from ‘‘we, the people’’ because we, the people, are the power in this country. Our rights come from God, and they are vested in we, the people. I thought the gentleman from Pennsylvania’s look at H.R. 1215 was a really deft way to focus on this and speak about the Magna Carta, but there wasn’t anybody back in old England in that time that had any shot at filing a liability claim, let alone receiving a frivolous claim that would make one individual vastly wealthy at the expense of a lot of other folks. So this is something that has accumulated over the last 502 years since the Magna Carta was signed. So I would say this: healthcare costs are out of control due in large part to unlimited lawsuits and other problems ObamaCare failed to solve or else ObamaCare made worse. H.R. 1215 is commonsense litigation reform legislation that will rein in overly aggressive and healthcare lawsuits while preserving the ability of plaintiffs to recover unlimited economic damages. The bill applies only to claims concerning the provision of healthcare goods or services for which coverage is provided in whole or in part by a Federal program, a Federal subsidy, or a Federal tax benefit giving it a clear Federal nexus. This isn’t criminal legislation. It doesn’t address the cases of rape. We should arrest those people and lock them up in prison and punish them to the max, but it is not the subject of this legislation. So wherever the Federal policy directly affects the distribution of 
healthcare, there is a clear Federal interest in reducing the cost of such Federal policy. This bill’s commonsense reforms, which have been the law in California for over 40 years, are conservatively estimated by CBO to save at least $50 billion. The previous estimate was $54 billion in Federal healthcare dollars. At the same time, this bill doesn’t in any way limit compensation for 100 percent of plaintiffs’ losses. As reported in The Washington Post last month, the U.S. healthcare spending is projected to accelerate over the next day. A study by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services project that the average growth in healthcare spending will be even faster between 2016 and 2025. The projections are based on an assumption that the legislative status quo will prevail. Studies show that, as healthcare costs rise, wages fall. H.R. 1215 will save billions of dollars in healthcare costs and will, thereby, increase wages for workers nationwide. Mr. Chairman, as I look at the picture of how I watched this defensive medicine grow over the years and over the decades, $650 billion potentially, reported by a Newsweek article, in unnecessary defensive medicine tests that are done. A doctor that ordered CT scans in massive numbers in a single day, when I see 97 percent of the MRIs just to be sure that the diagnosis of an ACL knee injury is protected in the case of liability insurance, we are not going to see just $50 billion in savings here. We are going to see hundreds of billions of dollars in savings. And as an anesthesiologist told me that—he was practicing in Texas— when Texas passed the law that is roughly a mirror of California law, that his premium as an anesthesiologist was $26,000 a year; and after the law passed in Texas, it dropped to $6,500, exactly onefourth. A 75 percent reduction in that particular case. He is now practicing in Iowa. Iowa passed mirror legislation as well. Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this vital legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–10. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows: 
H.R. 1215 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
A health care provider who prescribes, or who dispenses pursuant to a prescription, a medical product approved, licensed, or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration shall not be named as a party to a product liability lawsuit involving such product and shall not be liable to a claimant in a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor, or seller of such product. 
This Act shall apply to any health care lawsuit brought in a Federal or State court, or subject to an alternative dispute resolution system, that is initiated on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, except that any health care lawsuit arising from an injury occurring prior to the date of the enactment of this Act shall be governed by the applicable statute of limitations provisions in effect at the time the cause of action accrued. 
The CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 115–179. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . SESSIONS  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 115–179. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
talk a lot about the 50 States and the electoral college, and the States have an important function in our system of government. They are supposed to be areas where they have provinces and act. Juries, jury trials, and trial courts, that is all State law, and that should be determined by West Virginia, Texas, California, and Florida, not up here. This bill, when it went through committee, passed by one vote because a couple of folks—I think it was Judge POEand Judge G OHMERT ; I am pretty sure it was the two of them—two judges from the State of Texas felt it went too far in encroaching on the States’ province dealing with tort law. This amendment just goes the same direction. This is just unfortunate that what we are trying to do is help, really, insurance companies; it is not so much doctors. Doctors might benefit some, but it is the insurance companies that would benefit the most, and that is who this is about. So we oppose the amendment and we oppose the bill. We support the American people and the right of the people and the juries to dispense justice that the facts dictate and that justice demands. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, perhaps the debate that the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) had was completely clear, which I would disagree with that statement. The gentleman from Iowa stated very clearly that there are surgeries, there are procedures, and there are processes that cost the Federal Government hundreds of millions, and the gentleman even went into the billions of dollars, which are parts of practices of medicine that doctors do as a defensive part of medicine to avoid exactly what we are talking about: getting sued. It is costing the Federal Government an enormous amount of money. The gentleman did refer to two Members of Congress from Texas. We will see how they vote. But the clarifying amendments that we are offering now, amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 2, come directly from negotiations with and understanding with the Texas Medical Association and the National Physicians’ Policy Council to ensure that, in fact, the compliance is made that people not only in Texas, but also in other States, would have that would offer a physician the ability for them to use their knowledge, their training, and their expertise as opposed to practicing defensive medicine that harms every single taxpayer. That is why we are offering this today. I am delighted. I believe what we have done is right. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING). Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. I want to express, Mr. Chairman, how much I appreciate the work that has been done by so many people and their part in this bill. I rise in support of this improving amendment—it comes out of the minds of Texas, I might add—which would clarify the timing of the statute of limitations in the provision base of the bill. Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of the Sessions amendment. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment—a bad amendment—that makes a bad bill worse. All those folks from Texas ought to be going to Austin. Where this belongs is in Austin, not in Washington. These are State issues. We had an amendment that said that these defensive measures that you say that they are taking that waste all this money and time, we had an amendment that said these caps wouldn’t apply if you cut off the wrong arm, and you all wouldn’t take it. So I don’t know how many defensive measures they have got. This is the right arm; this is the left arm. When you go in to do surgery and you have to amputate an arm, take off the right arm or the left arm, but not the wrong arm. If you take off the wrong arm—damages big time. You all didn’t accept that amendment. This is shutting the courthouse door, closing down juries, and not having faith in the American people to be able to ascertain facts and damages as they have throughout time immemorial. It is a power grab from Washington. It is the swamp draining over to flood the State houses of all 50 of our States. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I believe the gentleman, Mr. KING, has argued the point very successfully, and that is we believe it is in the best interests of not only the taxpayers, but physicians, physicians who have used their training, their expertise, and their knowledge to perform the necessary missions that are necessary. When those physicians do make mistakes—and mistakes will happen—then we believe that the rights of those that are reported in California and Texas would be consistent with those that would be great for the country. We are willing to share, and we appreciate the opportunity to present this. Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment that I have presented today, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . SESSIONS  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 115–179. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk as the designee of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 12, line 13, insert after ‘‘goods or services’’ the following: ‘‘(including safety, professional, or administrative services directly related to health care)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 382, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I offer my thanks not only to Chairman BOB GOODLATTE , but also the distinguished gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) for his work on behalf of all Members on the floor today, for his work not only for the Judiciary Committee, but people of faith and confidence that this country can address the issues and needs. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment with Dr. MICHAEL BURGESS , who is also from my home State of Texas as well as a member of the Rules Committee. The goal of our amendment is to clarify that healthcare liability claims covered by the legislation include safety, professional, and administrative services directly related to healthcare. In other words, we are bringing in the entire scope, not just necessarily the medical procedure. I was glad to see that H.R. 1215 adopts many of the reforms that States across this country have thoroughly tested in their efforts to improve medical liability law, including my home State of Texas. Not all claims asserted against healthcare providers arise from the direct provision of medical care. My amendment addresses the full spectrum of healthcare claims by following the model that Texas has successfully implemented. Common examples of administrative claims related to healthcare are cases for negligence involving credentialing fraud against hospitals and those serving on their professional committees. In these cases, the plaintiff typically is not a patient of the physician serving on the committee; however, there is significant exposure to liability for the physician. Safety claims are another necessary component in the scope of this bill. In these cases, a patient’s injury does not arise out of the rendition of healthcare, but pertains to the safety of the patient. The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Alliance for Patient Access, and the National Physicians’ Policy Council are among those organizations who not only support this narrowly tailored amendment, but also their support of the entire bill and the inclusions of this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. 
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this is called the Protecting Access to Care Act, but that is really a misnomer because the purpose of these amendments in the bill takes as a given that there are going to be allegations that doctors, medical device companies—not exactly limited financial resources or in potential for harm—and nursing homes are going to be alleged to have committed torts against individuals and that when that happens, if this becomes law, there will be less opportunity for individuals to get their day in court. Because most people in the United States are not wealthy, most of the people that get injured not being wealthy are going to bear the brunt of this when they don’t get to court within the statute of limitations or they don’t collect because of the joint and several liability changes in the law or they get less with noneconomic damages because of the $250,000 cap. Who is going to benefit from this? Who is going to benefit? It is going to be the person who a jury has found to have been negligent and violated their duty of care: a nursing home, a medical device company, or a physician. They are going to have less damages, less judgments against them, and less costs. Insurance companies can then make more money, and doctors will have lesser premiums. Who loses? People who have been injured by medical device defective merchandise, nursing home negligence, or medical malpractice. We are not talking about limiting damages and the ability to recover by having a lesser joint and several liability law. We are not talking about people who have not gotten a judgment. We are talking about people who have gotten a judgment for negligence. Just like the Republican healthcare bill, this gives billions of dollars to the richest people in America with tax cuts at the expense of poor people who get Medicaid, people with disabilities, pregnant women, poor people, and seniors in nursing homes. They suffer. This is a microcosm of the healthcare proposals that the Senate can’t get 50 votes for—and they didn’t even try for 60, which they normally do, because they knew it was not going to be that sufficient, but now they can’t even get 50 under reconciliation—and it is a microcosm of hurting the poor and enriching the rich. These are cases where there will be judgments—juries finding negligence, harm, and damages—if you get to the courthouse on time, and then you won’t be able to collect as much. So who wins? The rich, the medical device companies, the nursing homes, and the physicians. Who loses? Those who have suffered, those whom juries have found to be victims, and victims who should be able to collect but we are limiting how much they can collect and we are making it more difficult for them to collect. That is not what this Congress should be doing is enriching the wealthy and hurting those who have been harmed by negligence. If it is going to happen, it ought to happen in the States. So it is an attack on the 10th Amendment. Mr. DUNCAN from Tennessee came here and gave beautiful testimony about a consistent life protecting the 10th Amendment, and that is what Mr. GOHMERT and Judge P OEalso did about what is left to the States. That is why this amendment and the bill are both bad. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman I respect very much, not only the perspective that the gentleman holds, but perhaps some of his argument could be true. Mr. Chairman, what we are trying to do is to balance out the opportunity for the American people to have access to healthcare where, many items, they are denied. I was reminded by the gentleman, the young chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Dr. PHILROE, who served his great State of Tennessee and the American people as an obstetrician and gynecologist, I was reminded of the facts of the case, as it were, where, when Texas passed this, counties all along our Texas borders received, instead of midwives and others who might perform these important services to deliver babies, all of a sudden medical professionals, doctors, came into play who had been shut out because of the fear of malpractice lawsuits against them. Texas added, in the first year, some 4,500 doctors who came to Texas knowing that it was a level playing field. In this case, Mr. Chairman, we are arguing that the United States of America and the citizens would not have to pay outrageous amounts of money for defensive medicine, whereby physicians, in order to protect themselves and to protect themselves in a difficult circumstance, might order, as a defensive mechanism, excessive amounts of either Xrays or other procedures that really cost the government money instead of providing better healthcare. b1545 This has been an advantage in the State of California, and in the State of Texas, where physicians use not only their training and their professional conduct, but they use what is in the best interest of the patient. That is why we are here today. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING). Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership on the Rules Committee and in many other ways; and I also thank Dr. BURGESS , another gentleman from Texas on the Rules Committee whose amendment is being offered by Mr. SESSIONS . As I listen to this dialogue, Mr. Chairman, I am just thinking that States do have rights. They have the right to control any of the healthcare services that are funded by individuals or States. This only affects that because it has Federal dollars in it. We drive at a 55mileanhour speed limit because the Federal Government sets that. So I rise in support of this amendment, but the States are not funding Medicare, Medicaid, or ObamaCare. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Tennessee has 1 minute remaining. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING), because I think it helps my case. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I am happy to accept the time from the gentleman from Tennessee and make the point that hasn’t been made very well here today that—apparently, not well enough or the gentleman wouldn’t have yielded the time to me, I don’t believe—where there are Federal dollars involved, there have been Federal regulations that have matched along with that. We have written all kinds of legislation in this Congress, a lot of which I disagreed with. But there was a Federal nexus, and it hasn’t been litigated successfully time after time after time. We saw ObamaCare itself was litigated over and over again and the Supreme Court came down with rulings that let that legislation stand. That is one of the reasons why we have the angst that we have today. But the case that this usurps States’ rights is thin. It is not without some consequence, but it is very thin. We have gone way over to the other side, and we have written everything that we can possibly write into this bill that respects the rights of States. There is always a Federal nexus—we can count on that—and it is so small in comparison to so many other Federal things. Some of the things in our Federal Government are overreach. This is not. This is a minimal, de minimis reach in order to regulate overthetop trial lawyers, who are the ones who are the only losers today, Mr. Chairman. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . ROE OF  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 115–179. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and amend the table of contents accordingly): 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 382, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, medical malpractice lawsuits in this country have gotten out of hand, which is hurting both providers and patients. Something must be done. I have spent 31 years practicing medicine in Tennessee before coming to Congress. In that time, I saw my medical malpractice insurance premiums increase from $4,000 a year to over $50,000 a year, by the time I left practice. Why were the premiums so expensive? My practice group took everyone: private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the uninsured. Some practices limit their patient populations, but when you are in rural Appalachia, you take all comers. The reality is, when you are taking care of patients with elevated risk, you get more frequent negative outcomes, increasing your risk for lawsuits, and this creates an issue for patient access to care. Finally, right when I was leaving practice in 2008, Governor Haslam signed into law some of the best reforms we have in Tennessee, in the Tennessee Medical Malpractice Act, which created a 60day notice statute and a certificate of good faith certifying a case has merit before it can be filed. In 2011, Governor Haslam then signed the Tennessee Civil Justice Act into law, which contained a restriction on who could testify as an expert witness in medical malpractice litigation. Too often, physicians practicing medicine are pitted in litigation against a professional witness who has gone to medical school but specialized in a different field and wasn’t even licensed to practice in their State or a contiguous State. Mr. Chairman, that is absolutely wrong. The fact is, these changes work. In Tennessee, we saw medical malpractice premiums reduced from 2009 to 2014 by between 25 and 40 percent, depending on the specialty. OBs saw average premiums reduced from over $52,000 to just over $33,000; neurosurgeons saw average premiums reduced from $49,000 to $35,000; cardiovascular surgeons saw their premiums go down from $44,000 to $31,000. There were other changes that were put into place that helped, including caps, but the fact was, this change had a major impact. My amendment follows Tennessee’s law and strengthens the changes contained in the underlying text of the bill, H.R. 1215, by adding further restrictions to those individuals who would qualify as an expert witness for medical malpractice litigation. My amendment limits who can be called as an expert witness, not only by the individual’s professional accreditation, but also by his or her geographic location. The fact is, as Tennessee’s law proved, we needed medical professionals from the area where the incident in question occurred to testify as an expert, not a foreign jurisdiction hundreds of thousands of miles away. If that proves to be impossible, the court can waive this requirement if a witness that fits these criteria is otherwise unavailable. Mr. Chairman, no one knows the people or healthcare providers in an area better than the people and healthcare providers in that area. Whether testifying for the plaintiff or defendant, it is important that those individuals called as experts really know the people in the area and aren’t simply flown in from a faraway place just to get a paycheck. We all want improved quality and lower costs of care. Reforming the litigation process is a step in the right direction. Mr. Chairman, I encourage Members to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, this is the Tennessee law. I remember it. It is probably not such a wonderful law, even in Tennessee, even though some of us didn’t care because Tennessee is an unusual State. You see it when you go to Rock City. From Rock City, you see seven, eight, or nine States. That is pretty good, even without the help of the Southern College of Optometry. If you are in Memphis, the bill would say that you could have an expert from Arlington, Virginia, come to Memphis. That is a long way, yet we are so much closer to Springfield, Illinois, or even to Dallas, Texas, or we are much closer to Baton Rouge, where they have got a lot of great doctors. Those doctors from Baton Rouge could come to Memphis. They would be closer to Memphis than somebody from Arlington, Virginia. The fact is, the State should decide this. Tennessee made this contiguous State or your own State law. For Alaska, that means you have got Alaska. For Hawaii, it means you have got Hawaii. The States should decide who is an expert and who isn’t. It also says you have got to be in practice for the previous year. If somebody is not in practice and they are a professor at a medical school and maybe the outstanding expert on cardiovascular diseases, and they happen to be someplace like Harvard, they wouldn’t be able to go to a State that is not contiguous to Massachusetts. If they weren’t practicing, they wouldn’t be able to be an expert at all. These arbitrary time limits, arbitrary requirements, and arbitrary demographic limitations are not aimed at justice or saving costs. They are aimed at reducing the number of experts who might be available. In a State, it is more difficult to get an expert to come testify because you may get ostracized by your fellow professionals. It might be easier for a plaintiff to find an expert from a State that is a little bit of a distance. I am not that familiar with Maine. Does it touch maybe Vermont and New Hampshire? It kind of limits itself, too. In Tennessee, you would have 9 or 10 States; in Alaska, none; Hawaii, none; Maine, two. Minnesota has got to be limited because we wouldn’t go to Canada because that is not part of our system. Of course, this isn’t really part of our system either because our system is a Federal system, where we give States the right to make these decisions and not make them up in Washington with a onesizefitsall way to stop people who have been damaged by medical malpractice, medical device defects, or nursing home negligence from getting whole compensation. We put a limit from Washington on the old person who is being taken advantage of by some individual in a nursing home or some individual who has been given a defective valve in their heart because of a medical device problem. 
We in Washington, under this bill, think we know more than what a jury should know about the effects and the damages when that person testifies in that courtroom in front of that jury and before that judge and have their damages proven. You can see that individual and know the harm they have been caused, but their damages are going to be limited because of something that goes on here in Washington, D.C. That is something the other side argues against constantly. They say things should be decided back home in the States—things like voting rights and trying to limit the opportunity for people in the Justice Department to see to it that people get a chance to vote. They say that States’ rights are primary when it suits their purposes. In Tennessee, the doctors own the medical malpractice insurance company. I think it has the word ‘‘Volunteer’’ in it. It is the doctors who own it. So they will be direct beneficiaries. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, where the subsidies were going in our State were to the lawyers, since they got over 60 percent of any medical malpractice settlement. The poor patients got less than forty cents on the dollar. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING). Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I thank Dr. ROE, the gentleman from Tennessee, for bringing this amendment. Looking at the language here, it is interesting that the concern was that the witnesses may not be available within a large State. I notice, as I read the language, that unless the person was licensed for practice in the State or a contiguous border State—that is pretty good. If you are Hawaii, maybe not so good. But Dr. ROE, typical to his style, anticipated these things by putting the waiver authority in the last provision in the amendment, which says: ‘‘The court may waive the requirements in this subsection if it determines that the appropriate witnesses otherwise would not be available.’’ So this is a sound, well thoughtout directive that ensures that we have a high level of professionalism. When the gentleman earlier talked about a jury of your peers, what about having professionals who are highly credentialed that do understand the locality and the normal practices within the region? So not only do I support this amendment, but I encourage its adoption. It requires expert witnesses to have knowledge of the standard of care in their local communities. It is a commonsense amendment, and I urge its adoption. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I was going to try to find that language. Years ago, a trial lawyer named J.D. Lee told me when I was just a 28year old constitutional convention delegate: Don’t go down rabbit trails. The gentleman from Iowa is throwing rabbit trails out there, and I am not going to go down one. The fact is, this is a State issue that should be determined by the States and should be determined by judges and jurors in their jurisdiction who see the defendant and see the plaintiff with their own eyes and determine the facts as the facts dictate and justice demands, is what we hear and what we live by in jury cases. That is what we should live by in Washington in determining what damages are, and not making the decisions up here in Washington, D.C. This is a bad amendment. It is a bad bill. It is contrary to the mantra that you normally hear from the other side. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I wish the damages did go to patients in Tennessee. They don’t. The majority goes to lawyers. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ), my good friend and a fellow OB/GYN. b1600 Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment offered by gentleman from Tennessee. Like Dr. ROE, I, too, have been an OB– GYN. The standard of care is defined by local physicians. Let me say that again. The standard of care should be defined by local physicians, and how medicine is practiced may vary from location to location. No matter what, all physicians, especially in rural settings, don’t have access to all the luxuries in tertiary centers. Demanding that experts representing either side of a dispute practice medicine in the State of jurisdiction is just common sense. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chair, as a physician I have seen firsthand how frivolous lawsuits against experienced physicians have hindered the health care system and increased costs to all patients. It is imperative we address this through common sense legislation. This amendment would require expert witnesses in medical malpractice negligence cases to have practiced in the same specialty and geographical area as the physician defendant. This limitation ensures that the expert witness has the qualified experience with and knowledge of the standard of care recognized in their local communities. I was a heart surgeon. I was not qualified to testify in a dermatology case. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting yes on Dr. ROE’s amendment and the Protecting Access to Care Act. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . HUDSON  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 115–179. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment that the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add, at the end of the bill, the following: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 382, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, access to a fair and just court system is a vital part of the makeup of the United States. It is important that courts are used to seek justice, not for the financial benefit of lawyers looking to take advantage of patients. Basic protections these amendments provide from frivolous lawsuits will provide peace of mind for the vast majority of physicians who work so hard to protect and heal their patients. Patients in States that have enacted comprehensive medical liability reform have seen their healthcare costs decrease and their access to quality medical care increase. Enacting these reforms at the Federal level will benefit patients nationwide. All provisions within this amendment defer to State laws and directly address the issues covered. The first provision is called the Sorry Provision. This provision would allow a physician to apologize to a patient for an unintended outcome without having that apology count against them in a court of law. Thirtytwo States plus the District of Columbia have an apology provision in place. The second issue in this amendment is Notice of Intent. This provision would require a plaintiff to provide a notice of intent to the physician 90 days before a lawsuit is filed. Cases are often settled before reaching a verdict, and this provision would encourage settlement before court proceedings begin. The third provision is Affidavits of Merit. This provision would require a plaintiff to have a physician in the same specialty as the defendant physician to sign an affidavit certifying the merits of the case before the lawsuit could be brought to court. Twenty seven States have some form of affidavits of merit, though the standards vary from State to State. The final provision in the amendment is Expert Witness Qualifications. This provision would require that any expert witness called to testify during a trial would need to meet the same licensing requirements as the defendant physician. Fortyeight States plus the District of Columbia have some form of expert witness qualification, though the standards vary from State to State. So you see, these are very commonsense provisions. They are provisions that many States already have, and they will lead to lower costs and better care for patients, which ought to be our goal in the end. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to my friend’s amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the introduction of apologies as evidence of liability, imposes on States the qualifications for expert witnesses in a healthcare lawsuit, requires plaintiffs to obtain a certificate of merit from a healthcare professional in order to pursue a healthcare lawsuit, and has a 90day presuit notification requirement. This amendment is very, very difficult in that it says that, if you apologize, a doctor apologizes, the hope is that the doctor can apologize and the patient may think: Oh, he apologized. That is nice. I won’t sue him. But then if you decide to sue him or her, you can’t put that apology in evidence against him. So it is kind of maybe crocodile tears, a crocodile apology. But it also requires a plaintiff to get a certificate of merit from a healthcare professional to pursue a healthcare lawsuit—not from a lawyer, but from a healthcare professional. You have got to go to the fraternity to sue a fellow fraternity brother. That is a strange one. This amendment would add numerous problematic provisions that significantly expand this bill beyond what was even discussed in the Judiciary Committee and in Rules, and it violates State sovereignty, all without any proper legislative vetting before coming to the floor. This is the first I have seen it or I think anybody has seen this proposal—not necessarily regular order. Its apology provision is overly broad and undermines the legal right of patients. This provision states any apology by a healthcare provider given to a patient or their family is inadmissible for any purpose as evidence of liability or an admission against interest. If it is a true apology, it should be admitted, but it won’t be. The purpose of socalled apology laws that occur sometimes at the State level, which is where they should be, is to encourage a doctor to apologize to the patient for any harm while preserving that patient’s ability to offer evidence of wrongdoing. Yet this amendment upends this balance by prohibiting the admission of all expressions of empathy or apology for any purpose of evidence or admission of liability. This overbroad language undermines the patient’s ability to offer evidence that he or she was harmed by wrongdoing. By making inadmissible admissions of fault by the provider, the amendment goes further than many State laws that do not prohibit admissions of fault and would still allow apology evidence to be used for purposes other than proving liability, such as impeaching a witness. 
Second, the amendment imposes highly restrictive expert witness qualifications on State courts, which we just discussed with Mr. ROE’s amendment. This amendment requires the expert witness to be an exact carbon copy of the defendant. The expert must teach or practice in the same specialty and must have been doing so at the time of the occurrence that forms the basis of the lawsuit and for 1 year preceding the occurrence. Under this provision, someone with 30 years of professional experience may not qualify; whereas, a person with 1 year of experience could qualify as an expert. Indeed, this rule excludes retired professionals, many academics, and researchers from testifying as experts. It should be up to a judge in the courtroom or to a State that has province over this jurisdiction, not the Federal Government. Third, this amendment imposes further burdens on injured plaintiffs beyond the already onerous requirements of the underlying bill before they can even file a lawsuit. The amendment requires an injured patient to obtain a certificate from a healthcare professional attesting to the legal merit of the case. This requires injured plaintiffs to find a healthcare professional, not a lawyer, to evaluate the legal merits of the case at the time of filing—closed frat house. Certificates of merit are a costly, unnecessary obstacle and only serve to block injured plaintiffs access to the courts. There is little proof that such requirements reduce frivolous litigation or costs to medical providers, and certainly they don’t help people who have been harmed by negligent treatment. This requirement overrides State supreme court decisions in Arizona, Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Washington, which held that similar lawsuit certification laws violated their State constitutions. The amendment also requires an injured plaintiff to provide a healthcare provider 90 days’ written notice before commencing the lawsuit. This notice requirement is another unnecessary hurdle intended to increase the cost of litigation for injured plaintiffs and dissuade them from filing suit. There is scant evidence that such notice reduces frivolous litigation or facilitates the compensation of the injured party. Finally, the amendment represents the extreme intrusion on States’ rights, which this whole bill does, and is such a flip from the normal Republican thought processes. Each previously described provision includes the socalled State flexibility provisions in an attempt to brush off federalism concerns that these provisions are mostly oneway preemptive. They only preserve State laws that mirror the amendments’ requirements and State laws which include requirements in addition to those imposed by the amendment. While it preserves State notice requirements, it overrides State laws that do not have such. The States, not Congress, should determine the qualifications for appearing as an expert witness in State court proceedings, determine the appropriate uses of apology evidence, and decide whether certificates are proper or not. For these reasons, I, unfortunately, have to oppose the amendment by my good friend Mr. HUDSON , who is a great Tar Heel. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much how time I have remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from North Carolina has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING). Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this improving amendment which would save even more Federal taxpayer dollars by requiring the filing of affidavits of merit from an appropriately qualified specialist, requiring that expert witnesses have speciality backgrounds relevant to the case, allowing doctors to apologize without fear of penalty, and requiring a 90day cooling off period before lawsuits can be filed to facilitate voluntary settlements. I urge its adoption by the House, and I would point out that, as the gentleman from Tennessee referred to a fraternity of healthcare professionals as if somehow they couldn’t come to an objective decision on their own profession, there has to be a fraternity of lawyers that are making these decisions for all of America right now. What we are seeking to do today is to bring this back to common sense, bring it back to we the people, keep it within the bounds of the Constitution, and reduce the cost of healthcare across America $54 billion, and we are looking at a potential for $650 billion a year. Mr. Chairman, I urge its adoption. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue, and I also would like to express my appreciation to my colleague from Tennessee. We all care about patients and we all care about patients seeking justice, but I just think maybe we disagree how to get there at this point. The one point he raised about the crocodile tears, the way he describes the Sorry Provision, look, doctors are human beings and sometimes things happen. It should be appropriate for a physician to be able to express those feelings that they are sorry that that happened without that being seen as some sign that there is guilt involved. So I think the Sorry Provision is important because the doctorpatient relationship is very important, and these are human beings. The other argument that was raised, that it is an undue burden to have to have an expert witness, listen. A lot of these cases are very detailed and very specific. If you are talking about a cardiothoracic event, you need a cardiothoracic surgeon to discuss that. A lot of these speciality fields, it is important that you have someone from that field as an expert. Frankly, there are folks out there who have the profession of being professional witnesses. They travel around the country and testify on behalf of the plaintiff bar. Frankly, I think we need to have experts testifying that are qualified to talk about those very specific cases that they are testifying against. The other thing that was raised is that the 90day notice is an unfair burden on a patient. Frankly, I believe that having a little bit of time where individuals can talk could actually help that patient get to a settlement, get some redress earlier. I don’t think you are delaying any kind of justice for individuals, but I think it is important that there is notification time, there is time for both parties to communicate. I think, in the end, you might end up having justice delivered much quicker than going through a lengthy trial that could have been avoided if you had a notice in the beginning. This amendment simply is seeking to provide justice for those who deserve it much more quickly with much less expense, but also to preserve our healthcare system. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . BARR  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 115–179. Mr. BARR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and amend the table of contents accordingly): 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 382, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. Mr. BARR. Mr. Chairman, I first want to commend Chairman GOODLATTE and Congressman K INGand others who worked on H.R. 1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act, which aims to address the real problem of junk lawsuits in the context of medical care. Seventyfive percent of the doctors will face a malpractice lawsuit over the course of their careers, and many of these claims are frivolous, which drives up the cost of healthcare, encourages defensive medicine, and contributes to the Nation’s severe shortage of doctors and nurses, especially in highrisk areas such as obstetrics, neurosurgery, and emergency medicine. We need to enact sensible medical malpractice reform, and given the clear Federal interest in reducing taxpayer costs wherever Federal policy affects the distribution of healthcare, I support H.R. 1215. However, H.R. 1215 does not go far enough to discourage the practice of defensive medicine, the provision of health services, tests, and procedures designed to shield the provider from legal liability but which may not be medically necessary or in the best interests of the patient. Defensive medicine is a major driver of healthcare costs and also reduces the quality of patient care. b1615 In that spirit, I offer this amendment, which would expand upon the reforms in H.R. 1215, to protect physicians from frivolous lawsuits, while promoting the practice of evidence based medicine to lower costs and improve healthcare quality. My amendment offers a legal safe harbor in the form of an affirmative defense for defendants who can show that they adhered to clinical practice guidelines in their area of medical practice. Rather than Washingtonbased care, the guidelines would be developed by the physician communitybased on the best available scientific evidence. This allows doctors to focus on practicing medicine and improves healthcare quality by encouraging the practice of evidencebased, not defensive medicine. A New England Journal of Medicine study on clinical practice guidelines and tort reform stated that ‘‘Safe harbor rules hold promise for realigning legal incentives with good medical practice and promoting fast uptake of proven modes of care.’’ By promoting adherence to clinical practice guidelines that are already maintained by medical specialty groups, this amendment would encourage physicians to provide higher quality care, while reducing medical errors and waste. Several States have already adopted safe harbor legislation and have significantly lowered the length and costs associated with medical malpractice cases. My amendment would build on the success of State safe harbor laws by expanding it to a national level, while not infringing on States’ ability to implement additional tort reform. Americans deserve healthcare reform that will help lower the cost of care and protect the sacred doctorpatient relationship. The current reforms within H.R. 1215 are an important first step to reducing the high costs of medical malpractice claims. My amendment will further strengthen this legislation to promote affordable evidencebased patient care, reduce defensive medicine, and allow health professionals to focus on patients’ actual needs. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to my friend’s misguided amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia). The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, this is incongruous with the rest of the discussion we have had. It is consistent in that it is an attempt to say that people who have been harmed won’t be able to recover, and it makes it harder to recover; and it protects the physicians— and the people—who basically are determined to have been negligent. But, it says that, it is an affirmative defense to any healthcare liability claim—that is not just to a doctor. A healthcare liability claim could be to a nursing home or a medical device company—where the defendant complied with a clinical practice guideline developed by a national or State medical society or medical specialty society that is applicable. They have just argued that for the plaintiff to have an expert witness, that expert witness has to come from the State where the action is brought, or a contiguous State. But, for the defendant, you can have a national practice guideline as an affirmative defense. So when you are in Memphis, you can’t get an expert witness from Harvard or the University of Michigan or the University of Southern California because those States aren’t contiguous, but the physician could get a medical society’s or a national society’s perspective and have it be an affirmative offense. It is inconsistent. The whole purpose of this law is inconsistency, to give an advantage to those who have much and who do harm at the expense of those who have been harmed and have less. We see this continual attack on the poor and the injured. In the healthcare bill, we talk about less opportunity because of diminution in Medicaid for the poor, disabled, seniors, and pregnant women to get healthcare. Here, we are talking about people who have been injured—actually, in fact, injured. And we are saying that a medical society’s rule should be an affirmative defense, no matter where they are. We limit the experts you can have, and we limit the damages you can collect. And this isn’t to some specious group. This is to people who have actually been injured, and the juries in their home districts have found them to be plaintiffs who proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant tort fees, or doctor, nursing home, or medical device company, breached the standard of care to which they were held to. It is giving them protections of the law given by Washington, almighty Washington. Once again, I submit to you that the swamp is not being drained but is overflowing to flood the courthouses and not allow justice to come to those who have been harmed by negligence. For time and memorial, it has been the province of the States, the Tenth Amendment. Tort liability and court systems should be determined by legislators and bar associations, maybe medical societies, but back home, not national medical specialty societies or national medical societies as defenses, which is what this particular amendment brings forth. I heard my friend from Tennessee say that in Tennessee, 60 percent of the verdicts go to lawyers. That is not true. He first talked about a law passed in 2008, that limits attorneys’ fees. So since then, it certainly has not been 60 percent, and even before then it wasn’t 60 percent. The typical contingency fee is a third, and nothing if you don’t win, and there are great expenses incurred. This is closing the courthouse door to injured parties who juries have found to be injured and limiting their access to recovery. This allows a national medical society to be a part of a fraternity to give an affirmative defense to another frat brother. I oppose the amendment, I oppose the bill, and I am in favor of an open and free court system that punishes malfeasance and rewards those who have been injured by people who do not practice up to the standard of care that is dictated for them in their own State. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Mr. Chairman, in brief response to my friend from Tennessee, the safe harbor legislation would not supplant the standard of care, but it would allow for evidencebased medicine to improve healthcare quality. Those standards would be developed by local doctors participating in their medical societies. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING), my friend. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Chairman, I have a statement before me from Chairman GOODLATTE , the chairman of the full Judiciary Committee. I am going to represent this as his statement, but the chairman thanks the gentleman from Kentucky for his clarification while he remains opposed to the amendment because it provides an overly broad definition of the eligible professional organizations authorized to issue the guidelines that would be used as an affirmative defense, and because it is not supported by the wider coalition of medical groups supporting the base bill. He looks forward to working with the gentleman to further refine and improve his legislative proposal. That concludes Chairman GOODLATTE ’s statement that he would like read into this RECORD . And I would say on my own behalf, Mr. Chairman, that I very much appreciate the work that Mr. BARR has brought to this. The language that he presented originally, that had to be amended in order to conform with the parliamentarian, I believe, does define this with clarity. So I am inclined to support the gentleman from Kentucky. We will see what happens if there is a recorded vote. Mr. BARR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for those comments. Mr. Chairman, the clinical practice guideline safe harbor policies have been supported by the American for Tax Reform, American College of Radiology, Healthcare Leadership Council, American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, American Society of Anesthesiologists, American Academy of Neurology, American Urological Association, American College of Surgeons, American Health Care Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, Alliance of Specialty Medicine, Third Way, American College of Physicians, American College of Emergency Physicians, American Osteopathic Association, American College of Cardiologists, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology. As originally drafted, the amendment set forth the procedure in detail. Nevertheless, the process by which clinical practice guidelines are proved and published is well established and well known. The text of the amendment clearly references that existing and welldefined process that provides for guidelines to be proposed, submitted, approved, and published through the National Guideline Clearinghouse under the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This is a process that ensures the integrity and quality of the applicable guidelines. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. GOODLATTE for his honest testimony and submitting it. For that reason, among others, I will be voting ‘‘no’’ on this amendment, and I hope that it will be found to be ‘‘no’’ by the Chair. Because when the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a fine Republican lawyer, says that the amendment is beyond what they intended, it shouldn’t really be part of the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. BARR. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 115–179 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order: Amendment No. 4 by Mr. HUDSON of North Carolina. Amendment No. 5 by Mr. BARR of Kentucky. The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote after the first vote in this series. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . HUDSON  
The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON ) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the ayes prevailed by voice vote. The Clerk will redesignate the amendment. The Clerk redesignated the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. A recorded vote has been demanded. A recorded vote was ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 222, noes 197, not voting 14, as follows:

The Acting CHAIR (during the vote). There is 1 minute remaining. b1653 Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania changed his vote from ‘‘aye’’ to ‘‘no.’’ Messrs. RICE of South Carolina and DENT changed their vote from ‘‘no’’ to ‘‘aye.’’ So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. Stated against: Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, on rollcall vote 335, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘no.’’ The Acting CHAIR (Mr. YODER ). The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. YODER , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1215) to improve patient access to health care services and provide improved medical care by reducing the excessive burden the liability system places on the health care delivery system, and, pursuant to House Resolution 382, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. I am opposed to the bill in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1215 to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): 
For purposes of this Act, the term ‘‘health care lawsuit’’, as defined in section 7, does not include a claim or action which pertains to the grossly negligent prescription of opioids. 
Mr. GAETZ (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended. Like so many communities and States across this country, New Hampshire has been devastated by the heroin and opioid epidemic. Last year alone, my State lost 500 people to substance use disorder. Helping families, first responders, treatment providers, law enforcement officials, and family advocates in the Granite State confront this crisis has been my number one priority in Congress. In 2015, Mr. Guinta and I founded the Bipartisan Congressional Heroin Task Force to raise awareness of this crisis and to advocate in a collaborative way for solutions at the Federal level. I am proud to report that our bipartisan task force is now 90 members strong, and we have made important progress in passing legislation and securing critical funding. But the causes of this crisis are complex, requiring a multifaceted approach addressing every angle of the epidemic, from treatment to recovery, from education and prevention to law enforcement and interdiction. A primary cause of opioid misuse resulting in heroin dependence is the overprescribing of opioid pain medication. The data is astonishing. A December 2016 study found that opioids were prescribed to 91 percent of patients after they had experienced an overdose, and, in fact, 63 percent of patients on high dose opioids were still prescribed high dose opioids after overdosing. We have all heard the stories: teens who had their wisdom teeth removed receiving 30day supplies of opioids, or a person with back pain receiving prescriptions for extended release opioids even though Tylenol would keep them comfortable. America consumes 80 percent of the global supply of opioid medication, and 650,000 opioid prescriptions are written every single day. Earlier this year, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the following extraordinary fact: if 100 people take opioid medication for 1 day, 6 percent will still be using 30 days later; and if 100 people take opioid medication for 30 days, 35 percent of those patients will still be using opioids a year later. Our task force is working closely with the medical community to strengthen prescribing practices so that patients can manage their pain in an effective and responsible way. Through my role on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I am working with my colleagues to improve pain management practices at the VA and to better understand alternative methods for pain management. The White River Junction VA facility in Vermont serving New Hampshire veterans is a great example where they have cut opioid prescriptions nearly in half by incorporating alternative treatments. While there is much work that we can do to understand this issue, there remain bad actors across this country who are exploiting those who suffer from substance use disorder for their own financial gain. In rural communities and elsewhere, pill mills churn out opioid prescriptions with no regard for the wellbeing of their patients. And just last month, a doctor in New England pled guilty to healthcare fraud for overprescribing opioids, including writing more than 1,100 Oxycodone prescriptions in a single month. Victims of exploitative prescribing practices must have the unencumbered capacity of our legal system to recoup their damages and to deter negative industry practices. I am concerned that arbitrary limitations in this legislation on legal damages could limit their ability to effectively respond to the opioid epidemic, and that is why my amendment would simply exempt from the legislation any claim or action that pertains to grossly negligent prescription of opioids. Should this bill become law, this provision will help protect those who have been exploited by predatory physicians operating pill mills. There is so much we should do to roll back this crisis, and I look forward to our continued bipartisan work. But today I urge my colleagues to approve this motion. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit is ambiguous, as there is no legal standard currently for that which constitutes gross negligence in the area of prescriptions. Already this legislation does not apply to circumstances in which there is criminal conduct. That means that bad doctors with bad intent will be prosecuted, and in every State in America, there are legal standards by which those very doctors would lose their license were they to engage in the conduct that the gentlewoman highlighted. Mr. Speaker, healthcare costs are rising at alarming rates due to the failures of ObamaCare. This bill will reduce healthcare costs. It will improve the quality of care received. Mr. Speaker, through this underlying legislation, we will enhance the relationship between patients and doctors. We will reduce frivolous litigation. And by ultimately addressing the challenges that arise with increasing healthcare costs, we will make it more easy to get to the affordability challenges with healthcare coverage. This will ultimately increase wages for the American worker because, due to the failures of ObamaCare, more businesses are having to put money into healthcare premiums and not into wages, not into job creation, and not into the success of the American people. Mr. Speaker, if what we really aspire to are better healthcare outcomes and more doctors able to treat people who are dealing with the challenges of opioid addiction, I would ask my colleagues to oppose this motion to recommit, support this bill, and get better healthcare outcomes for the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 5minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5minute votes on: Passage of the bill, if ordered; and The motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 1500.

RECOGNIZING THE CENTRAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Central Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired. Established in Utica in 1929, CABVI, as it is known, provides a wide range of opportunities for the blind and visually impaired, helping them to acquire job skills and training, good wages and benefits, and a greater independence and quality of life. In their important mission, CABVI employs a segment of our population that experiences among the highest levels of unemployment in the country. CABVI also provides vital health and rehabilitation services for people experiencing vision loss. Their resources and services have improved the quality of life for many in our region, including my late father who spent the last 7 years of his life legally blind and confined to a wheelchair. My family is forever grateful to them for their care and kindness. Today I was honored to welcome to Washington my good friend Rudy D’Amico, president and CEO of CABVI; Robert Porter, public policy director; and Leta Laukitis, executive assistant. Joining them from the southern tier, colleague Ken Fernald, CEO of the Association for Visual Rehabilitation and Employment in Binghamton, New York. All joined by Jennifer Small, chief operating officer; John Ellzey, assistive technology instructor; Katie Lawson, switchboard operator; and Chervelle Amaker, purchasing agent and buyer. Mr. Speaker, I thank them for their important work and their continued dedication to our community. I look forward to continuing to advocate for them throughout my time in Congress. 
b1730 LET’S GET IT DONE (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Senate Republicans delayed a vote on their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This is a bill that Republicans wrote in secret. They allowed no input from the public or members of the Democratic Caucus, yet they still could not find the votes to pass their bill. Maybe that is because it eliminates health insurance for 22 million Americans; it imposes an age tax on older Americans; it allows insurance companies to discriminate based on preexisting conditions; it slashes Medicaid and leaves Medicare to wither on the vine. But no matter the reason, the lesson is clear: it is time for Republicans to give up on their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The American people are benefiting from this law. Seniors like that they are saving money on prescriptions. Parents like that their kids can stay on their plan until they are 26. Workers like that their employers have to offer healthcare coverage. It is not perfect, but let’s work together to approve the Affordable Care Act to make sure it works even better for the American people. Democrats are willing to do that. If Republicans will give up the idea of repeal, we can work together to make the Affordable Care Act even better. Let’s get this done for our constituents and the American people. f 
WAYZATA GIRLS CHAMPS (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Wayzata High School girls synchronized swimming team, who recently won the Minnesota High School State Championship. The Trojans triumphed at the State meet last month, where the undefeated team earned the championship title for the 11th consecutive year. They faced tough competition, but Wayzata’s excellent figure scores put them over the edge to secure the win. This talented team of dedicated girls, led by Head Coach Hensel, worked hard all season, winning each of their meets by at least 11 points. That commitment didn’t stop at the pool. It is also in the classroom, where each of these students excelled as well. Mr. Speaker, congratulations to all the members, athletes, students, teachers, coaches, families, and fans of the Wayzata High School girls synchronized swimming team on their outstanding performance this season. 
TAX BILL DISGUISED AS A HEALTHCARE BILL (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I am angry. I am angry that Republicans are trying to fool the American people. The Republican healthcare bill is nothing more than a tax bill disguised as a healthcare bill. TrumpCare is an almost $570 billion tax break for health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the extremely wealthy. It is a bill that asks working families to pay more for less: less coverage, less access, and less care. Recently, a concerned constituent called my office after discovering that his son would need surgery at birth for a heart defect and then subsequent surgeries later on. He wanted to know what he could do to stop TrumpCare and protect his son, who would be born with a preexisting condition and face thousands of dollars of cost throughout his life. Mr. Speaker, let’s pass healthcare legislation that invests in and protects the healthcare of all Americans, holds the healthcare industry accountable, and lowers cost. f 
1–YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF DALLAS POLICE SHOOTING (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, July 7, 2016, is forever marked by the sadness and loss our community suffered when five Dallas police officers were gunned down in the deadliest attack for law enforcement in the United States since the September 11 attacks. These officers were killed as they protected Dallas citizens exercising their constitutional right to protest. They put their own lives on the line for the safety of others. Reflecting on the events of last July 7, what stands out to me is the heroism of those who answered when duty called and a community that banded together during this tragic event. We are in the midst of an environment that can be deeply divided. We should all seek to follow the example of the Dallas community. I want to acknowledge former Dallas Chief of Police David Brown and offer my sincere gratitude for his leadership; as well as the Dallas Police Department; first responders; the Parkland hospital; Baylor University hospital, where this iconic photograph was taken, for providing excellent emergency care; and others who helped the victims of this attack. Mr. Speaker, we must recognize the sacrifice of the men and women and the critical role they played to protect our communities. 
RECOGNIZING KELLY CRAFT AS U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CANADA (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to applaud President Trump’s selection of Ms. Kelly Craft as the next U.S. Ambassador to Canada. Canada is the number one export market for my home State of Kentucky. Agriculture is the major industry in my congressional district, and Canada is a critical export market for Kentucky farm products. As a result of our successful history of trade with the nation of Canada, I cannot think of a better person to lead relations between these two countries than my dear friend, Kelly Craft. Kelly was raised in Glasgow, Kentucky, which is 30 miles from my hometown. She has a lifetime of achievements and is extremely qualified. On a personal note, Kelly has always been there for and believed in me, and I am very appreciative of her support and friendship. 
I look forward to Kelly Craft’s great leadership as Ambassador to Canada, and I urge a swift confirmation process in the Senate. 
SENATE BILL A MARCH BACK TO BAD OLD DAYS FOR WOMEN (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, some of my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to claim that, under the Senate’s healthcare plan, women will be protected from discrimination. They won’t be charged more for their healthcare than men. However, the facts show that nothing could be further from the truth. The Senate bill actually targets women for the cruelest cuts of all. It does so by allowing States to do away with guaranteed access to essential health services, now available under the Affordable Care Act. They are services like maternity care, nocost birth control, and mammogram screening. But the Senate plan would allow States to completely waive any guarantee of service. States could, once again, allow insurers to consider preexisting conditions, like pregnancy, in setting fees and allow them to charge more. Plus, $800 billion in Medicaid cuts and defunding Planned Parenthood disproportionately harms women. Mr. Speaker, no matter how many times they say otherwise, they are marching back to the bad old days for women. 
DEBT AND DEFICIT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BERGMAN ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), who has always treated me very kindly. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as NAFTA renegotiation approaches, I rise to call attention to the mammoth U.S. trade deficit with our NAFTA nation partners. Our current deficit with NAFTA nations is $74 billion. This red on the chart translates into tens of thousands of lost U.S. jobs, all while wages are depressed for North America’s struggling workers. Since NAFTA’s passage, there hasn’t been a single year of trade balance for this country. That translates into lost jobs. Thus far, President Trump has failed to correct these trade deficits. In fact, the trade deficit this year has ballooned to more than $22 billion from the same period in 2016. Balanced trade accounts in 5 years should be first on our agenda. My bill, the Balancing Trade Act, H.R. 2766, requires the administration to address trade deficits of more than $10 billion with any nation. As negotiations near, let’s focus on key principles such as vigorously enforcing a first world rule of law; including labor provisions that allow workers across this continent to improve their standard of living and outlaw labor trafficking; enact environmental standards for human health and forge an agricultural labor agreement that helps displaced farmers; reform the unaccountable tribunals called Investor State Dispute Settlements so that they work for people, not just big corporations; address currency manipulation; and, finally, stamp out the illegal drug trade that is plaguing this continent. The wealth NAFTA created has not been shared by all, but only a very few, and often only the very rich. Our foundational principle for NAFTA reform must be free and fair trade among free people with a rule of law. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, this is one of those things I partially do, I think, as therapy. About once every other month, I ask for a block of time to try to take a bunch of very complex numbers and try to find ways to put them on boards and demonstrate them. I am going to take a little divergence just for a moment or two, in response to some of the things I have heard today. We are actually going to focus on debt and deficit and what is actually demographically driving them, what is really happening in this country, and what is going to drive all public policy in our life. You have had a handful of things said about the ACA—many people know it as ObamaCare—and our replacement. I know some of the things that the Senate is working on. There is a math problem—and it is very simple—in the individual market. So if you hear someone turn to you and say, This is about healthcare for everyone or this is employerbased, or Medicare, it is not. In my congressional district, less than 2 percent of my population actually purchased in the individual market. So you have to start putting this in perspective. Here is your math problem. Because the prices kept moving up and the deductibles kept becoming larger and larger, half of our population—that 50 percent that only uses 3 percent of healthcare dollars—stopped buying. I came across a number earlier this week—I haven’t had a chance to vet it, but it was in a publication—saying that, of the 18 to 30yearold population that would be in the individual purchasing market, only about 17 percent of them were actually buying the insurance. So those of you who do math, you start to understand what happens in a world where half the population that really uses very little healthcare services doesn’t buy a product and those who are purchasing it are those who are the high users of it. Remember, 50 percent of all healthcare dollars are used by 5 percent of the population. So you start to see it is this hockey stick curve that shoots up. That is the math problem that is trying to be fixed. In the last 3 years, if you are from Arizona, you have had a 190 percent price hike in the mean plan and you have a single choice. So if we are going to be intellectually honest, should we hold our brothers and sisters around here to their own words and their own promises? You remember the promises a few years ago about keep your doctor, $2,500 discount, lots of choices, lots of options, well, in Arizona, your prices have skyrocketed, you didn’t get to keep your doctor, and you now have a single choice. b1745 That is the reality of the math. Sometimes it is just so hard sitting here when you hear people just pulling things out of the air, and then you go to the bill and say: But I can’t find that. And you get these weird logic trains that if this happened and a meteor hit here and this and that. At some point we need to be honest with the American people saying it is a math problem. This is not about removing costs from the healthcare system. It is actually moving around, how you fairly distribute the cost of it. This summer now we are starting to work on it, just like we voted on about an hour ago a piece of legislation that starts to remove cost out of the system. It is these future pieces of legislation, like the tort liability bill that was just passed out of the House here, that will actually start to drive down costs. Remember a really important conceptual idea: in 1986, there was a law passed here, signed by President Reagan, that said you cannot deny an American health services if they show up at the emergency room, if they show up at the hospital. So if you actually look at the number of procedures in society in the last 30, 31 years, preACA, after the ACA came into effect, what we see in the future, we haven’t removed procedures and costs. We have just moved the money around. All right. So what is happening in our country? Do you remember when the President introduced his budget, what, about 6 weeks ago, 2 months ago, and the gnashing of teeth and the wailing and the crying? We have a math problem, and it is based on demographics. We are going to see this multiple times in these slides. I am one of them. I am at the very tail end. I am a baby boomer. There are 76 million of us who are baby boomers, who are heading towards retirement. That demographic curve is changing the cost structure of government. On the slide you see next to me, this is 9 years from now. Remember, we are 
working on, what, the 2018 budget? So actually less than that. This is what the world will look like in 2026. Do you see the Social Security being 24 percent of all spending? Do you see Medicare being 19 percent of all spending? Do you see interest on the debt? If you start to add up everything, you have to understand the world we are in is we are heading toward a time where threequarters of spending—actually, even more than that are what we call mandatory. They are formulas. You get this benefit because you turned a certain age. You get this benefit because you fell under a certain income. You get this benefit because you served in the military. But what so many of us talk about as being government is becoming tiny. In 2026, which is not that long from now, 11 percent of the budget is going to be defense; 11 percent of the budget will be nondefense. So that is your parks, that is your medical research, that is your education. That is this branch of government. That is all the branches of government. So 22 percent will be what we call discretionary. It is what I get to come down here and vote on because everything else is run by a formula. So if you are someone who comes to me and says: I really think we should be going to Mars. I really think we should be doing this type of healthcare research. I really think we need this money in education. Okay. I agree they are all incredibly important in our society. Are you going to help me find a way to reform what we call mandatory spending, entitlements? Entitlements—because of the aging of our population—is the primary driver, are consuming every incremental dollar. In a decade, this government will be spending $1 trillion more, and every dime of that will functionally have gone into entitlements. We will have gone 10 years where what we call discretionary spending—you know, these little two parts here—has stayed flat for a decade. This huge growth in government is actually in Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. Certain other entitlements are things you get because you fell below a certain income, and interest on the debt. Until we are actually honest about this—because it is so dangerous for a political person to even say the words ‘‘Medicare’’—we have to look at the numbers and understand the trust funds are bleeding. If you really want to protect our brothers and sisters and protect retirees, some of these are things we should have done a decade ago. And we keep avoiding them because so often Washington cares more about the political up side of attacking each side from even mentioning what is going on demographically and in these numbers. We are going to try to run through a bunch of these slides. Some of them, I apologize, when you blow them up on the big printer, they are going to get a little fuzzy, but we are going to just try to walk through these numbers. Hopefully, they will make some sense. Why is this slide up? This one is really important. When you get down to the very last bar chart, do you happen to notice something? You notice how they basically touch each other. That is 2027. How many years from now—how many budget years from now? So about 9 budget years from now. Do you see the lighter blue? Okay. That is Social Security. The gray is the Medicare. Then the Medicaid. Then you get up to net interest. Then you see the green at the very top, and that is other mandatory. Oh, heaven. Do you understand what that slide is telling you? That is saying, in 9 years, just the mandatory spending consumes all revenues, meaning defense will be on borrowed money, meaning almost everything you think of as government— once again, the Park Service, medical research, education—will be on borrowed money. At that point we are going to be borrowing probably a little over $1 trillion a year every year, and it gets worse and worse. I am incredibly blessed. I have a 20 monthold, and since the blessing of her coming into my life and my wife’s life, I think constantly: In the time I am spending here in Congress, what am I handing to her? Because right now the game is we spend it today, we consume it today, and we are going to let our kids and our grandkids pay it back. How does this become ethical? Yet if you listen to the speeches that happened on this floor today, it was speech after speech of: We want more money for something. At the same time—this is important—do you know how much we are going to borrow today? We are going to borrow over $1.6 billion today. I have 1 hour to speak here to you. Hopefully, if we are all blessed, I won’t go that long. Okay. So $1.6 billion divided by 24. Sixtysix million dollars an hour. Start to divide that and just think about that is just the borrowing side of spending, because we are going to spend about $11 billion today on a $4 trillionplus budget. So just understand that this is where we are going. This is already baked into the cake. This is the math. It is time for almost revolutionary thoughts on we need to look at the budget holistically. That means no longer having this little silo over here of this is discretionary, this is mandatory; and if you even talk about mandatory, you lose your political office. In many ways, this one is sort of doing the same thing but letting you see what is happening on the debt side. Now, why is the debt side so incredibly important to also focus on? We have to pay interest on it. We are borrowing money from your retirement, from the Union retirement, from the State retirement, but we are also borrowing money from a thrifty family in China, and we owe interest on it. We also make ourselves, as a nation, much more fragile to the world markets. We have been incredibly lucky the last few years of these stunningly low interest rates. How many of you actually believe the interest rates when you look at a 10year instrument today that I think was at 2.2 and believe that is normal? If we actually just moved back to nominal interest rates, our interest would grow very quickly in the next couple of years to be greater than our entire defense budget. As you look at this slide, look out to 2026, many years from now, except it is not that long from now. Do you see the green bar up there? That is total debt. That total debt is starting to crash in on $30 trillion. A bit of trivia. You often hear the differential people say: Well, there is public debt and there is publicly issued debt, and then there is debt where we borrow from the trust funds. Okay. And many of the economists really only score debt that is sold in the open markets. Okay. Fine. I understand that is the practice, but there is something that is intellectually lazy, because we still owe the money back to the Medicare trust fund, to the Social Security trust fund. It has been a while since I checked this, but I think last year I checked, and we were paying a 3.1 percent interest spiff. So we pay a higher interest rate for borrowing those moneys out of those trust funds. Do we have an obligation to pay that back? Of course we do. But for the intellectually lazy, it is just so much more comforting to say: Well, let’s just not look at that because, if we look at that, we are already over 100 percent of debttoGDP when we put in those dollars we have loaned to the general fund. Let’s just call it that. Let’s move on to the next one. If you look at this slide, you notice there is starting to be a theme here. I am trying desperately to get my brothers and sisters in this body to understand the greatest threat to our society is the money we are spending that we actually don’t have a way to pay for. If you actually look at demographics and where this debt curves, it just blows off the charts. This is an interesting little slide. This is a CBO slide for 2027. When you actually look at it saying: Okay. What does the world look like if mandatory— Okay. Do you see the blue? That is mandatory and defense spending. Because many people say: Look, we are going to spend on defense. We will be down to only—11 percent of this budget will be things you think of as government. Everything else will be entitlements or defense. 
Just as a perspective, we did this slide just so you could sort of see. I hear candidates running for office say: We are going to take care of waste and fraud, and that will balance the budget. Really? When only 11 percent of the budget in just a few years will be everything that isn’t mandatory or isn’t defense? You have got to understand the scale. This one is a little hard to read. I am going to reach over to it and play with my pen. When you actually look at this, what I am begging of you also to understand is—I think this is the 2016 year—we spent actually a bit over $3.9 trillion, but we only took in $3.3 trillion. You see the nature of the differential? b1800 And when you start to look at, first off, the beige there in the upper, we have been really blessed with incredibly low interest rates. So at a time where we should have actually been having an interest bill that would have been approaching a few hundred billion, we had less than $250 billion. Now, the dear Lord and the interest markets have been very, very kind to us. When you actually look at the curve, so much of the spending, once again, is what we call mandatory. But if you actually look at—we will call it the rust over there, something most people don’t understand. I am going to reach over and point to what is the individual income tax portion. What most people don’t understand is the individual income tax is the majority of the income to this country that is not intended for one of the trust funds. If you actually look at the corporate income tax, it has been going up, but it is still a fairly small sliver. Now, why did that change? And so often I will get people that bring me charts and say: ‘‘David, 25, 30 years ago, the corporations paid so much more.’’ Well, also, 25, 30 years ago, there was this new concept of passthroughs: LLCs and partnerships. So what happened is many things that used to be corporations in the fifties, sixties, seventies, up and through the eighties, at the end of the eighties there was this revolution where States all over said: Hey, why don’t we create these passthrough entities; they’re more tax efficient. How many of you actually have had an LLC? Well, that is a passthrough entity. But that is where you actually see the shift of corporate taxes going down and individual taxes going up. It is not that corporations all of a sudden start escaping taxes. It is their taxes now were actually booked as individual income. Just to understand, so when you see those charts, you have got to be able to sort of process and think that through. This is sort of important to understand where the taxes are. But, do you see that circle there, that 40 percent of the entire curve? That is payroll taxes. That is the income that goes into your unemployment, your Social Security disability, your Social Security, your Medicare. Those are revenues that are specifically for either your retirement future, if you have a break in your employment, or, God forbid, you become permanently or temporarily disabled, with Social Security disability having its definition of what temporarily disabled is. Just to understand, those are our revenue sources. Then you will see the little slivers on the bottom, and some of that is tariffs and some of the other fees that come in, partially through trade. I know, sometimes these slides are a little hard to see, so we actually blew a couple of them up. The idea here was just so you could actually see the total revenues. Now, this is for 2017, so this is our projection of what is going on this year. And my wife, right about now is when she would typically start texting me and saying I am putting everybody to sleep. But I am married to an accountant, so that could explain why we have no friends. That is the payroll taxes. Do you see the far side? Let’s call it turquoise. That is the individual income tax. That is why those of us on the Ways and Means Committee, when we are actually working on tax reform, many of us believe we have to sort of do an organic, a unified budget or a tax reform proposal that actually does everything from what you see here, corporate, which actually is much of our job engine, over to the individual, which is also now a huge portion of our job engine. Do not let someone just talk about lowering rates and not also understand that what you see on the individual side may be what you pay as a worker, but also, if you are an employer but you are organized as an LLC or partnership or passthrough, you are also on that side, just to know it is out there. Now we get to some of the more fun stuff. You were just looking at some of our revenues. We already know that this year, if you use the President’s budget—or Office of Budget and Management—we are about $600 billion short. If we use that of the Congressional Budget Office, we are, let’s just call it, $550 billion short, meaning we are spending that much more money than we are taking in. But, once again, let’s actually just look at where we are spending the money. So the turquoise, Social Security, Medicare, and other health programs, so Medicare and Medicaid. National defense is this. Then come over here. This is everything else, and this is interest. So, last year, we spent about $245 billion in interest. This year, we are still blessed with incredibly low interest rates. We are only expecting about $266 billion in interest. Still stunning amounts of money. But the little white area is what most people will think of as government. So if you look at last year—and the nice thing about using this one is it is booked. We know what it is. We took in $3.3 trillion; we spent $3.9 trillion. You already start to see the structural difference. So, if you actually start to come over here, now this is much better than it was a few years ago. The problem is, in this fairly strong economy, it is closed, and now, demographically, it is about to start to move away from us. This is the line you always have to constantly think about. If that is my revenues and I drop my line down, you have to start understanding that everything beyond that line is borrowed money. Just visually, I have always found this easiest when you actually start to show different groups saying: ‘‘Look, this is just where we are at.’’ And then you will stand up and say: ‘‘Hey, why don’t we do this? Tell me what I can cut because you want a balanced budget this year.’’ All right. Understand the math. If we are going to borrow $600 billion, that is most of defense. Okay. How about the other side, everything else we call discretionary? We could actually eliminate all of it and, believe it or not, you still don’t have enough money to cover the borrowing. So, if you are borrowing $600 billion this year, I believe that is greater than all of the nondefense spending in the government this year. So let’s actually start going through a little bit more where we are at and what is actually about to happen. The frustrating thing here is we have a number of charts that we have worked on about why we have been so off on our economic growth projections. If you go back a couple of years ago, we had these fairly rosy pictures where we were going to be, yet the country has not grown nearly fast enough. We are hoping this year, with the new administration, you are actually starting to see economic growth that will take care of a lot of these sins. I think GDP now, as of a couple of days ago, the Atlanta Fed’s calculator was at about 2.9 percent of GDP. You would like to be substantially higher, but if we could hold 2.9 through the rest of the year, we will take it because it is so much healthier than where we have been the last few years. Why this is important is, I just want to show, the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline for 2017, $559 billion more spending than we are taking in. But I am going to reach way over here and say, hey, what does the world look like 10 years from now? Ten years from now it is saying the annual shortfall, the annual borrowing, will be 1.4—actually, let’s be accurate—$1.408 trillion. So just the borrowing in 9 budget years will be greater than all of the discretionary spending of this year. 
And it is growth in entitlements; it is growth in mandatory spending. Why isn’t that what you hear behind these microphones all day long? I have to believe that those of us who get behind those microphones, we love our kids and we love our grandkids, but this is absolute decimation of the future. And do not blame the parts of the government that we vote for, the discretionary, because the math doesn’t show that. When you actually take a look at this, you see the darker and the lighter. The darker is defense, the lighter is nondefense. One more time, I know this is sort of geeky. But if you actually look from 1996 to 2001, yes, we have had certain economic upheavals; we have had an attack on our country. But if you actually look at the percentages of gross domestic product, which is how so many economists sort of look at our spending and say, ‘‘Hey, you are spending 3 percent over here of your GDP on defense,’’ it is pretty much identical where we were last year as to where we were 10 years or 20 years earlier. So, once again, what is exploding on us? Well, if you want to break it down, if you actually look at the different categories—and we are only going to do this slide for a second—the different categories will have stayed almost flat in the discretionary area for 10 years. So what is happening in our society? We are getting older. Something I thought was just fascinating because I have a great interest in the reality: We knew people were going to be turning 65. We knew baby boomers were going to be turning 65 for how many years? This body knew we had 76 million of our brothers and sisters who were born in an 18year period that would be moving into their time with their earned benefits, and we did what to prepare for it? So we are now about our fifth year into the baby boomers retiring, and we are now beyond the inflection point. If you went to school many years ago and you sat in a demographics class, they talked about, oh, in the 2000s, there is going to be this time where you are coming up against this inflection where the spending is going to explode. You are going to see a couple of slides in a moment where I am going to show you what has happened now where, when I was a child, for every $4 spent for children, $1 was spent for seniors. Today, that is reversed. There is some math difference in there and there is some population difference, but that is where we are at. This is an interesting slide. You do understand, as a nation, we functionally have zero population growth without immigration. In about 25 or 30 years, the country of Nigeria will have more population than the United States. So when you hear someone talk, saying, ‘‘Well, I am uncomfortable with trade,’’ they have got to understand, if we need consumers for our products, we need to be finding these countries that are going to have lots of young people, and they are our future markets. We in the United States are moving down. I think our average age this year is 37.2, and that will continue to go up for about the next 25 years. I just put this up because it is fascinating seeing where the young people are going to be in the world, and we need to start thinking about, if we are getting older as a society, how do we still use our intellectual prowess, our creativity, our manufacturing prowess to make things that are desirable to growing populations, and let’s make sure we have built a world and environment here where we can sell things to them. b1815 Because if we don’t, we don’t have the market ourselves. We are not going to have enough young consumers. So you have got to take that into reality. Once again, this one is a tough chart. It is on here just basically to understand what is happening in the world. What is incredibly fascinating is many Americans see China as our primary competitor, and in many products they are. On highvalue products, countries like Germany, actually, are more of a competitor. But do you see this line here, this collapse? That is the Chinese demographics. If you understand that line, you understand a lot of things that China is doing around the world in trying to buy assets that produce income so they will actually have an income stream to start paying for their senior population. The United States is this dark here, and you will see—here is where we are at. We are sliding. But look at how many of our trading partners also are in the same demographic curve. It is just worth understanding that when you see many of us who lean towards being free traders, we are looking for where there are populations in the world that we can go sell things to. I am an American; I want to sell you something. Now, within the Nation, just fascination, if year 2000 the average age in the United States was 35.3, 16 years later, we are 37.9, that is a huge shift. I know that may not seem like a big difference when you start talking about twoand ahalf some points. That is a big shift in 16 years on average age. But also what is fascinating is for those of us out in the West, we will actually be somewhat younger than the middle of the country and back East. I am blessed to be from Maricopa County, Arizona, the fastest growing county in the country. Come visit us. But it is also to understand that this aging of America also is going to require different societal needs, and different States are going to have very different approaches. If you actually look at a State like Utah, it remains fairly young. Some of our States back East actually get quite old and are going to actually have very different societal needs. This is the mandatory spending chart. I actually wanted to spend just a moment over here on some of the percentages. This one I know is really hard to read, but if you actually start to look at the second part over here, ‘‘discretionary,’’ do you see all of those little tiny percentages? This is where a lot of our discussions get very disingenuous around here. We will have people coming behind these microphones almost acting like their hair is on fire because some dollars have been removed from this agency, or dollars are going to be removed from this spending program, and the unwillingness to understand the scale that we are talking about. It is just real simple. If that is every dollar of discretionary spending plus defense, and every dollar of mandatory, the mandatory is what, twoandahalf times bigger? So if you are going to have a discussion of spending priorities, are we going to be a mature enough group to actually deal with the reality where the dollars are at? I promise, we are down to the last couple of these. So the share of the budget outlays, and this one is more—I am not being judgemental on this. It is just more of a thought experiment. This is actually from the Urban Institute, which it is always interesting to see a Republican using charts from the Urban Institute. This is a couple of years old, and the chart now is actually more aggressive. I just couldn’t get the newest one printed. Do you see this little edge right here? This is sort of the Federal spending. Ten percent is going to children. Fortyone percent of the spending goes to seniors. It is just a thought experiment. We want to honor and keep our commitments to the earned entitlements, but the reality of the demographics keep moving up, and as we keep those commitments, the pressure on everything else is going to get much more cantankerous, much more cranky, much more difficult. We have a saying in our office: It is always about the money. Some of the disharmony you hear around here is going to get louder because, as you have already seen, the trilliondollar engine over the next few years that consumes the next trillion dollars is all mandatory spending, is all demographics. So that is just another thought experiment. Every once in while we will get the people who come to us and say: Hey, David, why don’t you remove this program or that program? One more time, we are borrowing—so much for my writing—$1.6 billion every single day. And that is just the borrowing side, and we are spending close to $11 billion every single day. So on occasion, you will get a group that comes in and says: David, we want you to get rid of all foreign aid, but we want to make sure you still protect 
Israel, and we still want to help the countries that are trying to help us deal with narcotics. And you start to get down and say: Okay, so you want us to cut half of the foreign aid budget? Okay, great. Well, that would be about 14 days of borrowing—not spending, borrowing. Because remember, we are borrowing $1.6 billion every day. And there becomes the intellectual problem where you will get an individual who comes in and says: David, just take care of the waste and fraud. And there is waste and fraud out there, and we are going to have to do it. And we are going to have to be much more disciplined in the adoption and the use of technology. But a lot of that language is gimmickry until you have someone who is willing to step up and actually just talk about the demographics that are our Nation. So think about this: I will have stood behind this microphone—let’s just pretend it is an hour. Do you feel like you got $66 million worth of speechifying? Because we are borrowing $66 million a minute, $1.6 billion a day, and it is just not that. One of the reasons this is such a powerful chart—and this is from a private organization that does the U.S. debt clock. You do realize, the majority of debt in this country is borrowed. There was an article in Politico a couple of years ago that did this brilliant job. If you actually think about this, all of the student loans, all of the mortgages that have Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, SBA, all of these things, it was somewhere around 63 or 64 percent of all debt in the United States, you and I as taxpayers guarantee. The unfunded liabilities in Medicare itself over the 75 years, many actuaries have over $100 trillion. So when you see us fussing with each other down here, it is almost always about the money. And until we are willing to start talking about these numbers that are spinning out of control, the fussing is just going to get more and more angry until we step up and deal with the reality of what is driving our future, and that is demographics. Mr. Speaker, with that I yield back the balance of my time. 
PRIDE RESOLUTION The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. AL GREEN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight, and I am proud to do so, to present the Pride Resolution as June is Pride Month. I am also very proud tonight to have with me a member of the LGBT Equality Caucus, who happens to be the co chair—one of the cochairs. There are 6 cochairs and 11 vice chairs, 109 members. So at this time, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), the cochair, after which I shall make some additional comments. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, ALGREEN of Texas, for bringing forward a resolution simply acknowledging the importance of this month to the millions of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans across the country. ALGREEN ’s resolution stands in stark contrast to the silence of the Trump administration. For the first time in nearly a decade, there was no White House proclamation to celebrate Pride. And, you know what, Mr. Speaker, we are all proud of being Americans, and we all are proud of our heritage, and we are proud of who we are. Just as people are proud of their Irish American heritage, or their Catholic heritage, or they are proud to be women or proud to be men, people who are LGBT in our country no longer need to stay in the closet. They can be fully authentic with who they are, and they can celebrate in a spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood with their allies, and other LGBT Americans. Mr. Speaker, I got to participate in the Pride festivities in Denver this year, and I am looking forward next week to, for the very first time, being the grand marshal of a parade, the Colorado Springs Pride Parade. I have never had the opportunity to be a grand marshal before. But I am glad that ALGREEN and his cosponsors, including myself, are lending their voice, to say that this body, the House of Representatives, wants to, of course, honor and respect the full diversity of our country, and in the inclusive spirit, celebrate the civil rights accomplishments of the LGBT movement as well as recognize the work ahead to make sure that LGBT Americans are fully equal under the law. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind words, and I especially thank him for coming to the floor tonight. It means a lot that a member of the caucus would be here, and I want to let him know that I wish him the very best with the Pride parade next year. In Houston, we had our Pride parade. It is one of the largest events in Houston, Texas. Literally, thousands upon thousands of people line the streets, and everybody is celebrating a rich history that is American history. Again, I thank the gentleman for his attendance. Mr. Speaker, the resolution has 26 original cosponsors, and this resolution is one that we have presented for many years. As I am grateful to the many who have signed on to this resolution, I have to mention Senator SHERROD  BROWN because he has presented a resolution on the Senate side to acknowledge June as Pride Month. He has done so because of the circumstance that was called to our attention by Mr. POLIS. The White House has not issued a resolution, breaking with an 8year tradition. This is something that is expected. It is something that has occurred, and people tend to look to the top for the tone and tenor of our behavior to be demonstrated. I regret that we did not get the resolution from the White House. My prayer is that at some point the White House will have a change of heart, a change of mind, and will present a resolution. But be that as it may, tonight we are proud to present this resolution, and it is important that I present it as an ally of the LGBTQ community. I am an ally of the community for good reason, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I know what discrimination smells like. I know what it talks like. I know what it walks like. I know what it looks like. I have been the victim of invidious discrimination. I lived in the South. I am a son of the South, and the rights that were accorded me under the Constitution of the United States of America, Mr. Speaker, were denied by my fellow citizens of the South. I lived in the South, Mr. Speaker, born in Louisiana, lived in the South at a time when I had to drink from colored water fountains. And I must tell you, a good many of them were not the kinds of fountains that you would want to drink from. They were filthy, to be quite frank with you. I lived in the South at a time when I had to sit in the back of the bus. There could be many seats available in the front of the bus, but I had to make my way to the back to claim my seat. I lived in the South at a time when I had to sit in the balcony of the movie. It didn’t matter that there were seats in the lower level. I was always shown the balcony. b1830 At a time when I had to receive my food from the back door, couldn’t go in to many restaurants, and if I did have a restaurant that I could go in, it was some room in the back that was set aside for coloreds only—colored water fountains, colored restrooms, back of the bus, balcony of the movie, and, when we were locked up at that time, it was in the bottom of the jail. I know what invidious discrimination is like, Mr. Speaker, which is why I am here tonight, because I believe that, until all of us are free of invidious discrimination, every one of us is at risk of being a victim of invidious discrimination. This resolution is important because it speaks of the many gains that have been made in the LGBTQ community: Barney Frank, the first openly gay Member of Congress; Annise Parker, first openly gay mayor in the city of Houston; speaks of Stonewall; speaks of many accomplishments; speaks of a lot of the tears that have been shed. But tonight I want to really focus on the very end of the resolution. Rather than go through all of the whereases, I want to go to the be it resolved. 
Resolved: That the House of Representatives recognizes that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer— LGBTQ—rights are human rights and are protected by the Constitution, the Constitution of the United States of America; recognizes that all Americans should be treated fairly and equally, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. This is important, Mr. Speaker, because in this country today, in the United States of America today, we still have people who are being discriminated against because of who they are. In the United States of America, there are still people who have rights that are accorded them under the Constitution, very similar to my circumstances—not the same, but very similar, very similar, not the same, to my circumstances—wherein the rights that were accorded under the Constitution were denied by my fellow Americans, and people today are having rights denied by their fellow Americans. Mr. Speaker, Mr. CICILLINE , DAVID CICILLINE , Representative C ICILLINE , has a bill, H.R. 2282, the Equality Act. This bill has 195 cosponsors. This bill would address the inequalities that we see in America. Examples are always good. In this country, the Supreme Court has made marriage equality the law of the land. One would think that, if it is the law of the land, all persons who are married would be treated the same as all other persons who are married. All persons who happen to be of the LGBTQ community would be treated like I would be treated if I were married, as a person who is not a member of the community, but an ally. That is not the case, Mr. Speaker. In the United States of America, if you are married and you are of the LGBTQ community and you wear your ring to work the next day and proudly announce that you are married, you can be fired. You can be fired for engaging in an act that is constitutional in the United States of America. Why? Because we have about 31 States that have not clearly defined the fact that all persons are to be treated equally, endowed by their Creator with these certain inalienable rights, among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. All persons, this would include people who are of the LGBTQ community. But, unfortunately, in a good many States, they can be fired for just showing up to work and announcing that they are of the LGBTQ community. Mr. Speaker, no one should be denied the right to work because of who the person happens to be when it is a lawful—lawful—status that you occupy. Marriage is lawful in this country. People ought not be punished for being married. People ought not be punished for their sexual orientation in this country. In this country, you can be denied service, certain services, because of your sexual orientation. One would think that we were long past the time when people would judge you and draw conclusions about who you are and what you represent simply because of your sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is not a limitation on a person’s dignity, on a person’s humanity. Sexual orientation does not divest a person of citizenship, does not divest a person of rights supported under the Constitution. Sexual orientation is but a means by which a person was born into this world. I believe that my God doesn’t make any junk. I believe that my God created people purposefully and created them as they are to be who they are in a world where all persons should be treated equally, created equally by God, treated fairly and equally by humanity. So since I believe this and I have had these experiences, it is appropriate that I stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives to say to the world that we as a great nation should not allow ourselves to continue to deny human rights and human dignity to people because of their status, a status that they were born with, a status that the Supreme Court recognizes, a status that is to be protected under the Constitution of the United States of America. I am proud to stand here and take up the challenge and the cause. I am a person who believes that, until we have paid the debts to others for the work that they have done to accord us our freedom, we still have a job to do. There is still great work to be done. I didn’t get here because of my work alone. I didn’t get here because I am the person who ought to have this position. There were people who sacrificed and made it possible for me to have this opportunity. There were people who surrendered their lives so that I would have the opportunity to stand here tonight. So I owe a debt, and I am standing here tonight to continue to repay the debt I owe to others who made it possible for me to have the rights and enjoy the rights—to be more specific, enjoy the rights—that I enjoy in this country, and I want others to enjoy these rights as well. This is not to say that all of the discrimination against African Americans is over and the world is a perfect place. It is not. But it is perfect enough for me to come to the floor of the House of Representatives and stand for justice for others just as persons have stood for justice for me. So I thank you for the time, Mr. Speaker. It has been time well spent, in my opinion. I am honored that this resolution has been presented. I am honored that it has cosponsors—26. My prayer is that one day the House of Representatives will pass this resolution; my prayer is that one day Mr. BROWN ’s resolution will pass in the Senate; and my prayer is that one day this President will issue a proclamation, if you will, a resolution of a sort, recognizing June as Pride Month, LGBTQ Pride Month. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f
