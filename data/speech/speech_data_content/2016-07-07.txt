Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to climate change, the data is in and the science clear: Our world is shifting. Sea levels are rising. Glaciers are shrinking. Oceans are becoming more acidic. What is more? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is 95 percent certain that humans are causing the current climate change trend. To sit here and deny the science simply because it inconveniences us does nothing but cause greater harm for our planet and future generations. Each day that passes without action on climate change is another day we are wreaking havoc on our world. I think President Obama said it best when he stated: ‘‘If anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You’ll be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it.’’ It is hard to believe that some of my colleagues are so determined to deny climate science that they are willing to sacrifice the health and safety of Americans. Nowhere is the sacrifice more evident than in our waterways. We use water for everything, from drinking and bathing to growing crops, shipping goods, generating electricity, and recreation. But climate change is creating profound changes to this precious commodity, threatening water availability, access, and quality. Many areas of the United States, especially in the West, currently face devastating water supply issues. The amount of water available in these areas is already limited, and our demand will continue to rise as the population grows. One of the greatest examples of this is the Colorado River system, a major source of water supply for the Southwest. In recent decades, water flow through this important river system has been lighter than expected given annual rain and snowfall rates. Not surprisingly, studies show that rising temperatures and climate change are the cause of this decreased water flow. As greenhouse gas pollution continues to pile up, it traps more heat, continually raising global temperatures, and parches the Colorado River watershed. Researchers expect that for every degree of Celsius of global warming, the amount of water that gets evaporated and sucked up by plants from the Colorado River could increase 2 or 3 percent. With 4.5 million acres of farmland irrigated using the Colorado River water and with nearly 40 million residents depending on it, the incremental losses that are predicted will have a devastating impact. As the West continues to experience less rain and an increase in the severity and length of droughts, greater impacts on drinking water supplies are projected. Unfortunately, it is not just the western U.S. that is in danger. In my own region, the Great Lakes are under threat as they are warming at rates faster than the world’s oceans. It is expected that the Great Lakes region will grow warmer and probably dryer during the 21st century, with temperatures in the region warming anywhere from 5 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit. The impact climate change has on the five lakes will have serious implications for aquatic life, as well as high economic costs for our communities. Several different climate models for the Great Lakes region all predict that lake levels will decline over the next century. Within another 30 years, Lake Superior may be mostly ice free in a typical winter and has already experienced increased water temperatures. Lake Erie water levels, already below average, could drop 4 to 5 feet by the end of this century, significantly altering shoreline habitat. We are at the tipping point, and instead of addressing the root of the issue, climate change, my colleagues continue to deny the science. Our waterways are national treasures. They serve as the backbone for our health, economy, ecosystems, and recreation. We cannot simply stand by while the course of the world is altered. The science is clear, the data is pointing us in one direction: Now is the 
time to act on climate change. We are not given a planet with unlimited resources. It is our job to protect our waters and the people that rely on them, and that begins with finding real solutions to our climate crisis. 
STOP SPENDING BILLIONS IN AFGHANISTAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. JONES ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I am on the floor again today with a prophetic political cartoon. In the cartoon, Uncle Sam is in a wheelchair, and he is at the edge of a cliff that is known as the fiscal cliff. Then, he has President Obama pushing him in the wheelchair; and then the donkey, representing the Democratic Party, is pushing Mr. Obama. And then the elephant, representing the Republican Party, is pushing the donkey and President Obama to push Uncle Sam off the cliff. What is ironic is that Uncle Sam is yelling like he is excited: ‘‘I can see Greece from here.’’ Well, we know what has happened to the economy of Greece. It is in total collapse. Mr. Speaker, we are $19.2 trillion in debt. I was here in the year 2000 when Bill Clinton left office. We were the majority in the House and the Senate. We were headed for a surplus. The debt in 2000 was $5.6 trillion. Now we are here 16 years later and it is $19.2 trillion. The reason I bring this up is because we have an opportunity to stop spending billions and billions of dollars in Afghanistan. It is nothing but a waste. It is a waste of our young men and women in uniform. It is a waste of the taxpayers’ money. Recently, in an article in The Washington Post titled ‘‘Former Afghan Leader Karzai: Military Action Cannot Resolve Conflict in Afghanistan,’’ the former President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, told The Washington Post recently that he doesn’t think a military effort will bring peace to Afghanistan. He said: ‘‘We did it for the last 14 years and it didn’t bring us that, so how do we know . . . military action will bring us that now?’’ We are going on 15 years of being in that country—and the waste, fraud, and abuse in Afghanistan is worse now than it has ever been. I think about the needs of our veterans, I think about the needs of our children, I think about the needs of our senior citizens, and so many other needs. We passed a bill yesterday to help with the mental health issues of America, yet it is not funded. But, yes, we will find the money to fund Afghanistan so we can continue to waste and spend the taxpayers’ money and get nothing for it. It is just absolutely ridiculous. Mr. Speaker, I voted against the Department of Defense bill last week simply because there is another $43 billion in there going to Afghanistan. This is OCO funds, it is slush funds, and it can’t even be accounted for. The taxpayers are frustrated with both parties and fed up because we are not doing our jobs. We are not doing what is necessary. We ought to be debating Afghanistan on the floor of the House and we ought to be saying, ‘‘Is it worth it or is it not worth it,’’ and have an upordown vote. No, we just let it continue to go down this road with no end to it. Mr. Speaker, I close this way, because to me this tells you more about Afghanistan than anything I could say today. Afghanistan is known as the graveyard of empires. Well, I know one empire that is headed for the graveyard, and it happens to be the United States of America. And if we continue to fund and waste the taxpayers’ money in Afghanistan, then I hope that graveyard will have a headstone, and it will one day, that says ‘‘USA,’’ because we will be in the graveyard of Afghanistan. 
GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE) for 5 minutes. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a vice chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and in solidarity with the majority of Americans who are demanding that Congress take meaningful action to prevent gun violence. We all know the statistics. Whether it is through mass shootings that make the headlines or the unseen violence that happens daily on our streets, gun violence takes the lives of more than 30,000 of our Nation’s citizens each year, a number that far exceeds other industrial countries. Now, all these countries have their share of violent extremists and madmen, but only our country gives easy access to weapons of mass killing. And that makes all the difference for America. Rather than seeking out commonsense solutions to address this crisis, the Republican majority continues to cower to the gun lobby and the firearms manufacturers. Now they plead the Second Amendment, but Constitutional Law 101 would tell us that all of our rights, including the precious freedoms of religion and speech, must be balanced to protect innocent third parties and to protect the safety of the wider community. One commonsense measure we should all agree on is background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, domestic abusers, and the dangerously mentally ill. You can’t shout ‘‘fire’’ in a crowded theater because of your freedom of speech, and neither should you be able to buy a weapon if you have a history of violence and criminality. In fact, almost 90 percent of Americans, including the majority of gun owners, support universal background checks for all gun purchases. The problem is that our present background check system is rife with loopholes. Background checks are not required for private sales at gun shows. They are also not required for Internet sales. Bipartisan legislation has been introduced by Representatives PETER KING and MIKETHOMPSON that would finally close this egregious loophole. It is an entirely sensible reform that would have a measurable impact on the safety of our schools, homes, and neighborhoods, without preventing lawabiding citizens from using guns for selfdefense or recreational purposes. Despite attracting 186 cosponsors, including several Republicans, the background check legislation has never been brought to the floor or even received a hearing in committee. It has been languishing for more than 15 months. Meanwhile, the shootings and the suicides and the massacres continue to accumulate. My colleagues, we must do better. Our fellow citizens are totally fed up, both with the unspeakable killing and suffering and with a feckless Congress that hasn’t lifted a finger to prevent it. Now, this week, after intense public criticism and a historic protest by Democrats on the House floor, Republicans seemed for a while to be willing to hold a vote on legislation they claim would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms. After all, nearly 2,500 individuals on the terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in this country. But rather than embrace existing bipartisan legislation to actually fix the problem, Republicans put forth a woefully inadequate proposal that would require law enforcement and courts to grapple with unworkable processes, unreachable standards, to be completed in an unreasonably short period of time. Their bill would allow suspected terrorists to receive firearms by default after only 3 days if the court is unable to work through a complicated process. That is the same flaw that allowed the White supremacist Charleston shooter to obtain the weapon that he used to murder nine people at Emanuel AME Church. In other words, the bill is totally inadequate. Now, under pressure from their most extreme Members, Republican leaders refuse to even put this bill on the floor. What should be on the floor is bipartisan legislation, H.R. 1076, that would permit the Attorney General to block gun sales to suspected terrorists. This legislation, based on a proposal from the Bush Justice Department, would still allow individuals to challenge the government in court to restore their gun ownership rights. We don’t have to choose between protecting our communities and respecting due process. b1015 And so, Mr. Speaker, we ask our colleagues how much longer must we 
wait? How many more people have to die to move us to act? How many more American towns and cities must be added to the constantly growing list of places like Orlando and Columbine and Aurora and Charleston and Newtown? Moments of silence aren’t enough. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. In fact, the Scriptures teach us that such pieties give grave offense when they mask a refusal to do what we know is right. We need action. I call on my colleagues to bring these commonsense proposals to the floor for a vote. 
ONGOING PEACE PROCESS IN COLOMBIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud and encourage the ongoing peace process in Colombia. Over the last 52 years, Colombia has witnessed an armed conflict between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The conflict has taken a serious toll on the country: 220,000 people have been killed and more than 6.8 million people have been forced from their homes. The fighting has been especially difficult for the rural areas of the country. But a new day is on the horizon for the people of Colombia. The country is on the verge of a historic peace agreement with the FARC. In fact, the government and the FARC signed a cease fire agreement on June 23. This was seen as one of the few remaining roadblocks to a final peace agreement. With all that is going on in the world today, it would be easy to miss the important progress taking place in Colombia. The peace process isn’t garnering the media attention that some other foreign affairs are, but it is going to have just as important an impact on global affairs. Last year, I had the opportunity to travel to Colombia with the Committee on Armed Services and my colleague from Arizona, Mr. GALLEGO , whose mother is from Colombia. It didn’t take long for me to realize that Colombia is a beautiful and fascinating country, and I was very impressed with the hospitality of the Colombian people. It also became clear during my trip that the majority of Colombian people want things to be better in their country, and they are committed to the peace process. Mr. Speaker, Colombia is our closest and strongest ally in Latin America, so the peace process is very important not only to Colombia, but also to the United States. Their future opportunities are also ours. Colombia has a growing economy with immense potential based on their abundant natural resources and a culture that values hard work. A more stable Colombia will allow the country to further expand their economy, which would be a benefit to us right here at home. At a time when there are so many foreign policy challenges around the globe, Colombia is a rare success story. The country was literally on the verge of becoming a failed state, but now they are a leader in the region. The United States maintains significant bilateral relations and has provided important diplomatic assistance to the Colombian Government, but we have done so without becoming overly involved in their local affairs. So, Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize my strong support for the Colombian peace process, and I call on every Member of this House to also lend their support to that process. We need to encourage our neighbors in South America. I want to commend President Santos for his leadership and his commitment to a lasting peace. I also want to highlight the important work of Ambassador Pinzo´n. I appreciate his friendship, and I applaud his work to strengthen the partnership between the United States and Colombia. Ultimately, only the people of Colombia can reach the lasting peace agreement that restores justice and order to their country, but the United States can—and I believe we must— stand ready to assist the Colombian Government as they finalize this process and then as they move their country out of conflict and into a period of stability and lasting peace. f 
ANOTHER AMERICAN SHOT DOWN BY THE POLICE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I had planned to talk about something else this morning, but the events of the last 12 hours changed my plans. I watched this morning on TV and online—like a lot of Americans—another of our fellow Americans shot down by the police. This time it was in St. Paul, Minnesota. Earlier this week, it was in Baton Rouge. But we know it is everywhere—in Chicago, in Baltimore, in South Carolina. It seems that every week or month another Black man is shot by the police, and we always have the same reaction: Oh, it is a tragedy; there should be an investigation. A lawsuit is filed, and another settlement. Oh, the Justice Department and the FBI need to oversee the investigation because we cannot trust the police to police themselves. And then we go back to business as usual, and nobody actually does anything. State by State, city by city, and county by county, we might make this reform or that reform, but there is no national strategy to stop police from killing people, especially Black people, especially Black men. I wept this morning as I watched the mother of Philando Castile describe her son. She said he had a job, he served children in the cafeteria, and that he was a calm young man. She also said that he was not a thug. Why does a Black woman in the 21st century in the United States of America, while a Black man sits in the Oval Office, almost 50 years after Martin Luther King, Jr., was gunned down, why does she have to start her description of her son with ‘‘He was not a thug’’? She said: ‘‘We are being hunted.’’ Mr. Speaker, this is another sad chapter in American history. I do not feel compelled to say in describing my grandson Luisito: Well, first and foremost, he is not a gang banger, he is not a thug. But for this Black mother and for a lot of African American mothers in this country, that is something they feel a necessity to say. This mother did everything right. Her son was still shot dead by the police. This young man was riding in the passenger seat of a car with his fiance ´e and 4yearold little daughter in the backseat. He had a permit to carry a weapon, which he announced to the police. So he had gone through the background check, gone through the training, and had the concealed carry permit. But he was shot dead in front of his loved ones, his fiance´e and daughter. Why is it in 21st century America we have to have a conversation about how to avoid being shot by the police? Why do I have to instruct my grandson about deescalation if he comes in contact with the police, about strategies to prevent a sworn public servant, an officer of the court, a trained member of law enforcement, and I have to instruct my teenage grandson how to prevent that person from shooting him to death for no reason? Why, Mr. Speaker? We have no national strategy, no national conversation. When Americans are literally crying out in the streets that, yes, Black lives matter, we have no response from the Congress, the people’s House. None. The head of the FBI announces he won’t press charges against a candidate in the Democratic Party. Stop everything; we need to have hearings, congressional hearings. Benghazi, let’s spend millions on hearings, political hearings. Planned Parenthood, let’s form a special committee to do what the majority party feels is important from their political point of view. But a young Black man is shot by police in his car in cold blood? Nothing. Young men are shot by police, videotapes are withheld from the public, and nothing happens. Mr. Speaker, I think Black lives matter. I think the lives of young men in inner cities across this country matter. And I think this Congress should be the place where America comes together to decide what we are going to do about young Black men getting shot by the police. Not next week, when it is going to happen again. Not next month, when it is going to happen again. Not waiting safely until after the election, 
when it happens again, again, and again. Mr. Speaker, this Congress needs to come together and lead, and we need to start right now. 
RESTORING ACCESS TO MEDICATION ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Restoring Access to Medication Act, introduced by my good friend and colleague, Congresswoman LYNNJENKINS . Mr. Speaker, for far too long, Missouri families have suffered from the neverending financial burdens and health consequences imposed by the Affordable Care Act. From limited access to physicians to skyrocketing premiums, ObamaCare has failed our country and our people. For years, Missouri families have used health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts as an important tool to save and help pay their medical expenses, including overthecounter drugs. In the United States, more than 20 million individuals and families have taken advantage of HSAs and FSAs. They have counted on them to help protect against unexpected healthcare expenses and better plan for medical costs throughout the year. Under ObamaCare, the administration did its best to get rid of these HSAs and FSAs by limiting the amount of savings people could contribute to them and how that money could be used. They even mandate that funds in HSAs and FSAs cannot be used to purchase overthecounter medications without a prescription from a physician. Simply put, this administration added yet another layer of ‘‘Washington knows best’’ red tape to how to spend your money and how to manage your health care. As a mother of three, I remember sick children, cold and flu seasons, and latenight runs to the drugstore for cough syrup and fever reducers. I know that these unexpected expenses directly impact families that are fighting to make ends meet. Adding another doctor’s visit just so you can use your already saved money to purchase over thecounter medications is unfair, it is wrong, and it is downright senseless. The Restoring Access to Medication Act will repeal this portion of the law that unfairly targets pocketbooks and reduces access to everyday medications like aspirin and allergy relief. This legislation will put Americans back in the driver’s seat, restoring control of the family’s daytoday health expenses and needs. Mr. Speaker, in addition to this legislation increasing access to overthe counter medications that families need, it allows Americans to, most importantly, increase the amount of money they contribute to their health savings accounts. While doubling the amount both individuals and families can contribute to their accounts in 2017, this new law will also have a net decrease of $2.2 billion for our Federal budget over the fiscal years 2016 through 2026. Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled that the House has passed this bipartisan, commonsense legislation which places the healthcare needs of families above the liberal interests of bureaucrats in Washington. It will save families money and put them further in control of their healthcare decisions, something the everfailing Affordable Care Act will never do. f 
HISTORY OF THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington (Mr. MCDERMOTT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, during my 28 years representing Seattle in the Congress, there have, unfortunately, been several mass shootings in my district, including one in 2006 at the Jewish Community Center and another one in 2014 at Seattle Pacific University. I know the pain and the frustration that members of the delegation from central Florida are feeling 3 weeks after the shooting in Orlando. As a psychiatrist, I know and understand the trauma that these types of violent events inflict on individuals and communities. As someone who was around Congress in 1994 when the first assault weapons ban was passed, and in 2004 when it expired without action, I thought it would be useful to talk for a few minutes today about the history of that ban and how Congress capitulated to the gun lobby and allowed weapons designed for killing to flood our communities. Congress began consideration of an assault weapons ban after two mass shootings in California. In January, in 1989, a disturbed man with a long criminal history walked into the Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, California, and fired 106 rounds in 3 minutes from his semiautomatic rifle, killing 5 children and wounding 32. Nothing happened. It is no surprise that we have the same thing happen in Connecticut and nothing happens. Four years later, in 1993, a failed businessman opened fire in the Pettit & Martin law firm in San Francisco with a pair of semiautomatic pistols, shooting hollow point ammunition. b1030 The predictable public outcry and strong support for an assault weapons ban following these shootings led Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN to put forward legislation that would ban semiautomatic weapons. In an unprecedented show of bipartisan support, former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Gerald Ford joined together to publicly urge Congress to ‘‘listen to the American public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of these weapons.’’ A ban on assault weapons eventually passed the Congress in 1994 as a part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. However, in order to get that legislation through the House, a costly consensus was made to gun rights supporters and the NRA that allowed the ban to sunset or expire after 10 years. So, despite the importance of the assault weapon ban, it was allowed to expire. From 2003–2008, Senator FEINSTEIN  led numerous efforts to reauthorize the ban, but not a single bill left her committee. We had the same here in the House. Carolyn McCarthy made the plea over and over again. Her husband and son died on a Long Island Railroad train from a guy who came into the train and shot up the aisle and killed them. One hundred four people were gunned down during this time period in mass shootings, and all Congress did was to send a message that weapons designed for use in the theater of war were acceptable for use on our streets. While I certainly do not want to minimize the loss of lives, I find it important to point out that Congress felt compelled to act on an assault weapons ban in 1994, following two shootings that killed a combined total of 13 people. For some reason, this body can’t seem to summon the courage to act after 27 are killed in Connecticut, 24 in San Bernardino, 9 in Oregon, 12 in Colorado, and 49 in Orlando. And I could go on and on and on for my entire speech. The question you have to ask is: Have we become so numb to the pain of mass shootings that, no matter how many innocent people are gunned down, we won’t find the will to act? Has the NRA desensitized my Republican colleagues so much that the slaughter of children in a kindergarten doesn’t even result in a single vote on the floor, a denial to bring the issue out here and debate it in public? What is the price that the American people must pay before Republicans quit this obstruction? 100 killed? 200? Fifty doesn’t seem to hit threshold. I understand reinstating the assault weapons ban will be tough, but, Mr. Speaker, we must have that debate if we are going to have a society in which we all feel safe. 
BRING THE BILLS FOR A VOTE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. CAPUANO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I don’t like being here. I had meetings I had to cancel. I had phone calls I had to put off. But I am committed to doing everything I can to get two votes on the floor—just two. They are simple issues: no fly, no buy, and closing the gaping loopholes in background checks for the purchase of a gun. That shouldn’t be a 
problem. I don’t know anybody who opposes those items. We can’t get a bill on the floor because the Republican majority is afraid of their own position. They are scared to let the American people know where they stand on these issues. Just yesterday, we had to use a legislative gimmick called a motion to recommit, which nobody in America understands—I didn’t understand it before I got here—but it was the only way we could get the issue on the floor. And even then, when Mr. THOMPSON offered it, it was ruled out of order. Through machinations of rule on rule on rule, we weren’t even allowed to vote on that. The item was ruled nongermane and a motion was made to lay it on the table. The only vote we got was to overrule the ruling of the Republican chair to lay it on the table. The people who voted to lay it on the table yesterday voted to allow terrorists to buy weapons. The people who voted to lay it on the table yesterday voted to allow criminals and terrorists to continue to buy guns under our current gaps in the background check law. That is what that vote was. Now, I know no Republican who voted that way will go home and explain it to their constituents. They will say: Oh, no, it was just a procedural motion. And many of them will probably get away with it. That is a shame. What I don’t understand is why people claim this is somehow against due process—and, by the way, the bills have due process in them; written by a Republican during a Republican Presidential administration—when there is plenty of due process. If anybody wants to add more, we will add more. No one was concerned about due process when they voted for the PATRIOT Act that allowed the NSA to listen to everybody’s cell phone conversations. No one was caring about due process when Americans grabbed people from around the world and kept them under lock and key for as long as we want. But now we are concerned about it. God forbid we offer an amendment to deal with their concerns. All I want is a vote. All I want is Members of this body to have the courage of their convictions. If you think those bills are bad, bring them to the floor and vote ‘‘no’’ and go home and explain it to your constituents. I do it all the time. That is why I came here. I thought that is what we did. We are not supposed to be the people who hide. We are supposed to be leaders. Lead. Don’t cower in fear behind political nonsense and gimmickry because you haven’t got the courage of your convictions. This issue will not go away. The American people are tired—and have been for a long time—of politicians who refuse to stand up and be counted for their principles. We don’t mind disagreements. I don’t mind losing on an issue here and there. I do mind not being given the opportunity to debate and vote on the important issues of the day, issues that everybody in America wants. Mr. Speaker, that is why I am here. We will debate the merits another time—if we are lucky—but it will not go away, and you cannot hide from your refusal to allow a vote on these two simple, commonsense proposals. f 
VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself with the outstanding comments of my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. CAPUANO ). I couldn’t agree with him more. I am, proudly, a member and cochair of our task force against gun violence. I proudly support every American’s right to own a firearm. I believe as strongly as anyone in this room that all we are trying to do here is get a vote, a simple vote—let the votes fall where they may—a simple vote on closing loopholes as they relate to background checks and making sure terrorists can’t buy guns if they can’t even fly. Now, over the last many months, I have spent many 5minutes talking about all those who have died because of mass shootings in this country. I have a memorial wall outside my office that is filling up quite quickly with all the lives that have been lost because of mass shootings. During our sitin on the House floor last week, we read the names of those in Orlando who were victims. Today, I am going to remember the 54 other victims last month in 51 other mass shootings that took place in the month of June. Even excluding Orlando, so many people last month were affected by mass shootings that I don’t have time within my 5 minutes to list those who were injured but survived. Here are those who died in mass shootings in June that were not victims in Orlando: Devonne Burton, 28; Sean Pointe, 27; and Derrius Woods, 27; were killed on June 4 in Denver, Colorado. Brian Harris, 44, and Robert Sykes, also 44, were killed when a gunman opened fire in a motel on June 5 in Phoenix, Arizona. Jeremy Taylor, 54, and Sean Strickland, 26, were killed when a gunman opened fire in a convenience store on June 7 in Cape Coral, Florida. Raekwon Brown, 17, was killed outside a school on June 8 in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Adrian Potts, 20, was killed outside of a university apartment complex on June 11 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Stephanie Gonzalez, 17, and her sister, Kimberly Gonzalez, 13, were killed by their mother’s exboyfriend on June 11 in Los Angeles, California. The shooter also wounded their mother and brother. Cynthia Villegas, 34, and her daughters, Yamilen, 14, Cynthia Janeth, 11, Abby, 7, and Ida, 3, were killed by their husband and father on June 11 in Roswell, New Mexico. An unidentified 30yearold man was killed outside an ice skating park on June 11 in Stockton, California. Reggina Jefferies, 16, was killed as she was attending a memorial service on June 14 in Oakland, California. She had just performed a praise dance honoring two boys who drowned. Robert Marto, 54, and Jason Moore, 41, were killed outside of a bar on June 18 in Warren, Ohio. Cameron Wilkins, 21, and Felicia Williams, 32, were killed in a housing complex on June 18 in Waycross, Georgia. Cameron had seven children. Ronald Graves, 30, was killed in a house on June 19 in Exmore, Virginia. Gary Porter, 41, was killed at a party on June 19 in Syracuse, New York. He had four children. Monte Compton, 24, and his cousin, Donte Jefferson, 29, were killed on June 21 in Louisville, Kentucky. Gerald Berkey, 36, Jackson Edens, 28, and Terron McGrath, 31, were killed in a trailer on June 22 in Lacey, Washington. Terron leaves behind two daughters, 8 and 12. An unidentified man was killed on June 22 in DeKalb County, Georgia. Carlina Renee Gray, 50, Jan Marie Parks, 55, and Allen Rowlett, 60, were killed on June 24 in District Heights, Maryland. Treavon Lewis, 22, and Jordan Larkin, 18, were killed at a dance club on June 25 in Fort Worth, Texas. Fernando Wingfield, 44, was killed outside a bar on June 26 in Atlanta, Georgia. An unidentified man was killed on June 26 near a pool in Houston, Texas. Ruben RigobertoReyes, 60, Edmundo AmaroBajonero, 26, and Katie Gildersleeve, 30, were killed on June 27 on a blueberry farm in Woodburn, Oregon. Phoukeo DejOudom, 35, and her children, Dalavanh, 15, Xonajuk, 14, and Anhurak, 9, were killed by their husband and father on June 29 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Chanda Foreman, 37, was killed while sitting in her car on June 30, in Chicago, Illinois. It was her birthday and she was going out to celebrate. This carnage must end. Just give us a vote on two modest bills to help stem the bloodshed. 
A MESSAGE 68 YEARS IN THE MAKING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I love my country. No one says the Pledge of Allegiance with greater enthusiasm than I. No one sings ‘‘God Bless America’’ with more love for country than I. b1045 Mr. Speaker, I consider it a preeminent privilege to stand in the well 
of the Congress of the United States of America to address some of the great issues of our time. Mr. Speaker, the message that I deliver today has been 68 years in the making. The message that I deliver today had its genesis with my mother, who cautioned me that I must behave a certain way in the presence of the constabulary, the police; a mother who was concerned for her son, who always made it very clear to me that I had to say yes, sir and no, sir, and that I had to always accept whatever the police said to me. This message is 68plus years in the making, Mr. Speaker. The message is, in part, based upon what my uncle, who was a deputy sheriff, shared with me about my behavior in the presence of the police; that I must always, always yield to the police; submit to the police; never challenge the police. Sixty eight years in the making, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, my heart is heavy after what has happened over the last 2 days to Black men in the United States of America. My heart is heavy. I had the unfortunate circumstance of seeing what happened to that man in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on the ground with his hands flailing, blood flowing from his chest. I heard the young lady this morning pleading to God: Jesus, God, don’t let him be dead. Maybe not her exact words, but very much what she said: Don’t let him be dead; don’t let this happen. Mr. Speaker, we have to do something about the killing of Black men at the hands of the constabulary in this country. If you don’t want to investigate the police, if you don’t want to investigate the system, the culture that causes it, investigate Black men. Find out why they want to run out in front of bullets. Let’s find out why they are the ones who are consistently, and with some degree of systemic order, forcing themselves upon the police such that they find themselves dead. Investigate us. I am a Black man in the United States of America. I have lived what I am saying. Sixtyeight years in the making, that is how long this speech has been made. I don’t need a written piece of paper. I know what is going on. I was a judge for 26 years. I saw it. I can give firsthand testimony about what is going on. It is time for us to investigate what is happening to Black men in this country. Black lives do matter. These people are trying to tell us something, these young people. We must listen to them. Let us not ignore what is going on. The camera’s eye doesn’t lie. If you look at these videos and you use your common sense, you know that there is something going on, and we need to investigate it. And it is pervasive, it is not just one off circumstances that we are having to contend with. These things are happening across the length and breadth of this country. Every venue has some account that can be called to our attention. It is time for us to do something. Mr. Speaker, I call on you. Mr. Speaker, you are the Speaker of the whole House. Mr. Speaker, I call on you to assemble the House so that we can address the issue of Black men dying at the hands of police in this country. And we ought to investigate it to the extent that we come to conclusions about the people that are involved in these tragedies. We should not have to have another mother to have her child in the car, 4 years of age, when her boyfriend is killed. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time, and I thank God for giving me 68 years to develop this message. And I pray, Mr. Speaker, that you will do something about what is happening to Black men in this country. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CHANHASSEN HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS SOFTBALL TEAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Chanhassen High School girls softball team on their State championship. After finishing their regular season with a record of 17–3, and in second place in the West Metro Conference standings, the thirdseeded Storm went on to win four games straight to win the Section 2 championship. And then, as Section 2 representatives in the State tournament, the Storm won over Forest Lake, Hopkins, and Buffalo, outscoring their opponents 19–5 on their way to the championship. Mr. Speaker, it is accomplishments such as these that are a testament to the skills and the values that all high school athletics teach, and these young ladies demonstrated determination and toughness on the field as well as drive and responsibility in the classroom. Balancing schoolwork and athletics can be challenging, but these student athletes proved themselves to be both leaders on the diamond and in the classroom. The families, teachers, friends, and our entire community are very proud of these young ladies. I congratulate the Chanhassen High School softball team on their win. 
LIFE AS A BLACK MAN IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, my topic today was going to be on the issue of gun violence, mass shootings, the need for Congress to take some action to keep America safe, the fact that 90 percent of the people of this country want Congress to take some action. I was going to speak about that today. But I would be remiss, as a Black man in America, to pass up the opportunity to comment about life as a Black man in America, in an urban setting, particularly when it comes to police community relations, you see, because we live in a gun culture, and nowadays, everybody has a gun. Some folks have a culture of growing up shooting, hunting. Nothing wrong with that. Take the kids to the gun show, the family, on a Saturday afternoon. And at the gun show there is a bunch of unlicensed gun dealers there selling weapons of mass destruction to any and everybody. That is a part of the culture because everybody wants a gun. Well, it is time for universal background checks. That is a simple piece of legislation, closing the gun show loophole, which that loophole is bigger than the Goodyear Blimp traveling sideways. That loophole is so big that you could fit the Goodyear Blimp through it sideways, and it is worth nothing because unlicensed gun dealers can sell guns to any and everybody. Any and everybody can purchase a gun over the Internet, no background check required. We need to close that gun show loophole by passing legislation that enforces the notion that there will be universal background checks. I wanted to talk about that today, and I still think that is important. But even if we have universal background checks in this country, there is still a problem for Black folks who decide to arm themselves. I mean, we had the case of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, yesterday, pulled over for a busted taillight. Here is a working man in the car with his girlfriend and her 4yearold daughter, and he is armed, as everyone else in America is. But he is a Black man riding in the streets of a city in America, and so he must not be allowed to have that gun or, at least, if he has one, everybody is in such fear that they develop a trigger finger. And when he reaches for his license, then he gets blasted four times and his life is snuffed out. That is what happens to Black folks in America. Now we find out that the man had a valid license to carry that firearm. In many States now, due to what the NRA lobby has done, you don’t even need a license to carry the firearm in your car. So the man was acting lawfully. He gets blasted. He is no longer with us. The day before, Alton Sterling got a little hustle going on. He is selling CDs at the store, at the corner store. Why shouldn’t he be allowed to have a weapon? He has got a weapon in his pocket. Everybody else has got a weapon in their pocket. But no, he is a Black guy, and so we automatically develop a trigger finger when the police approach. Take him down hard, two on one, throwing him all across the car. You saw the video. If the man had wanted to shoot, he would have pulled the gun out much 
quicker than when they threw him across the car and had him on the ground pinned to the ground. And he ends up getting shot in the back and in the chest. This is life in America. This is our culture of gun violence that this Congress has allowed to manifest itself in this way. We shouldn’t have to live like this. Nobody should have to live like this. People walking around afraid of what their neighbor is going to do to them because they know that he has got a mental problem and he should not have a weapon, but he was able to get it over the Internet or through the gun show, unlicensed firearm dealers. So weapons have proliferated into our society. We are now at war, not with a foreign enemy, but with ourselves, with our neighbor. It is not fair to any of us. But I tell you, when America coughs, Black folks have always gotten pneumonia. Nowadays, when America coughs, Black folks die, and it really has to stop, ladies and gentlemen. This is not the way that we should live. 
A CALL FOR MEANINGFUL ACTION ON GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) for 5 minutes. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call for meaningful action on gun violence. The key word in that sentence is ‘‘meaningful.’’ The tragedy in Orlando served as a dark wakeup call to all Americans. Across the Nation, in every major city, to every small town, Americans are speaking with one voice saying: ‘‘Enough is enough.’’ The American people are demanding a no fly, no buy bill that prevents those on the terror watch list from purchasing firearms. How have Republicans responded? They have put together a weak, unworkable, and convoluted bill that will not address the real problem. Imagine, under this legislation, law enforcement must convince a court within 72 hours that the buyer ‘‘has committed or will commit an act of terrorism’’ before it could block a gun sale. Is this your idea of homeland security? Really? Is this how you protect the homeland? Mr. Speaker, the standard is simply unreachable and unworkable. Now, one has to wonder where Republicans got such an unfeasible idea. b1100 The answer is as simple as it is sad. The NRA, which represents large weapon manufacturers, wrote this legislation. We need a real, effective no fly, no buy bill that stops those on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms. The Republican legislation is simply a giveaway to the NRA that will hobble law enforcement. We also need a system of effective, universal background checks that keeps guns out of the hands of those who would do us harm. Once again, House Republicans are standing in the way. They are preventing consideration of this measure that is supported by 90 percent of the American people. Why? Just to keep their friends in the NRA lobby happy with them. Why? Follow the money. Mr. Speaker, this is unconscionable. The week after the Orlando slaughter, I read on this floor the names of the victims. At that time, I said that while we will never forget them, their memory will inspire us to real change. But this is not real change. We do not honor the victims of Orlando by passing legislation written by the NRA and gun manufacturing lobbyists. In fact, if anything, this legislation is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. Well, I have news for you. The American people see through this, and they are not buying it. I urge my colleagues: do what is right. Reject this unworkable NRA backed trick so that we can vote on real, meaningful legislation to address gun violence in this country. f 
GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, I joined with my colleagues here in the House of Representatives, and we took an extraordinary action. We sat in, we rallied, we challenged the Republican leadership, and we spoke out about gun violence in a way that we had never done before. We said to the leadership: Enough is enough; we have got to do something about these mass murders; we have got to do something about these guns. We challenged the leadership because we all know that the gun lobby has too much influence and too much control in this House. We also know that too many of our Members will not confront this issue on the opposite side of the aisle because, as it has been said, they are the handmaidens of the NRA. So we gathered, we spoke out, and we were talking about two simple bills that we wanted them to vote for. We are trying to educate the American people that those who do not want to go against the gun lobby will have the American citizens believe that we are trying to take away their guns. We are not trying to take away anybody’s guns. This is not about the Constitution or the Second Amendment. We simply said we want to bring to the floor two simple pieces of legislation. One is no fly, no buy. What does that mean? It simply means if you are on the list of persons who are prevented from flying because you are suspected of being a possible person involved in terrorism or something of that sort, you cannot get on an airplane. It is something about your background, what you have done, and the connections that you have that will not allow you to place our people on the airplane at risk. So what we are saying is if you can’t fly because you will place fliers at risk, you shouldn’t be able to buy a gun. So that is what no fly, no buy is all about. If you are too dangerous to fly, then you shouldn’t be able to go and purchase a gun. That is very simple. The other is universal background checks, and that is very simple. We have some background check laws, but still there are people who sell guns out of the back of their car at these gun shows, and they have no background checks. They could be murderers, they could be people who are involved with serious domestic violence, they could be people who are dangerous, and they could be mentally ill. We are saying we have to have universal background checks. What is controversial about those two bills? But they won’t pay attention. They will not take up the bill. As a matter of fact, the leadership is threatening us. They want to charge us with violations of the House rules, take us to the Ethics Committee, and have us sanctioned in some way because they say we have violated the rules. Well, I say to them: I won’t be intimidated. I am not afraid of them or the Ethics Committee. If they want to take us to the Ethics Committee, come on, let’s go, because we are going to stand up for what we believe in, and we are not going to be intimidated by being charged with violation of the rules of the House. Now, while I am talking about not being intimidated by anybody, I want to congratulate and thank Mr. AL GREEN of Texas for what he says has been a 68year journey where he got up in our caucus today, and he took this floor in a way that I have not seen any Member of Congress in the years that I have been here take the floor and just bare their hearts and just say what is on their mind. I have never seen a Member of this House come to tears and beg us to do something about the killing of Black men, in particular, that is going on. While we are dealing with gun violence—and we are dealing with gun violence to protect everybody—I want to tell you, I have been here when we have had the mothers up here from Newtown. I went to Charleston, South Carolina, where the Emanuel Nine were killed, and I stayed up all night with people placing flowers in front of the church. I literally went to Mr. AGUILAR  and sat with him when the San Bernardino massacre happened. We were here when Columbine happened, and we all thought at that time that we have got to do something. We have done nothing. Then there is Orlando, Florida; there is Aurora; there is Arizona; there is 
Virginia Tech; and on and on and on. We have been fighting to do something about these massacres. The police should be with us. The police should not complicate our job by doing what is being done. You have heard about the latest two killings in Baton Rouge and in Minnesota. They are absolutely heartbreaking. I listened last evening to this woman crying, screaming, and saying: ‘‘God, please don’t let him die.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Well, you may stop me now because my time is up. But I will be back. I will not stop on these two issues: massacres and the killing of Black men in particular. 
GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as someone who supports the Constitution, including the Second Amendment. I stand here today as someone who believes in protecting our national security. In fact, I have risked my life to defend it. I stand here as someone who supports the will of the American people because that is my job. In my previous job, I was an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps. Over the course of four tours in Iraq, I used guns every single day to do my job. In fact, guns saved my life. I do not want to take away guns from me or any other lawabiding American citizen. But I do want to make sure that terrorists, criminals, domestic abusers, and the dangerously mentally ill do not get guns they shouldn’t have. All we need to do to accomplish that are two simple, commonsense things: background checks for all sales of guns with no loopholes that criminals and terrorists can exploit; and, second, if you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy. These simple, commonsense gun safety measures are supported by nine out of 10 Americans. So if we are going to do our job here in Congress, if we are going to follow the will of the American people, if we are going to protect our national security, and if we are going to continue to uphold the Constitution, then we should do these things. The reason that they are so important is because of the Americans who have been killed by senseless gun violence. Mr. Speaker, the following is a list of mass shooting victims from just 2016 alone: Antoine Bell, age 17. Raymon Blount, age 29. Ira Brown, age 20. Joshua Steven Morrison, age 18. Randy Peterson, age 64. Sean Marquez, age 19. Marvin Douglas Lancaster, III, age 21. Jennifer Jacques, age 42. Ernesto Ayber, age 29. Carlos Bates, age 29. Isaiah Major, III, age 43. Dwight Hughes, Jr., age 21. Trisha Nelson, age 28. Armando Curiel, age 17. Raul Lopez, age 19. Angel Lopez, age 20. Officer James Lee Tartt, age 44. Manuel Ortiz, age 28. Mary Lou Nye, age 62. Dorothy Brown, age 74. Barbara Hawthorne, age 68. Rich Smith, age 53. Tyler Smith, age 17. Emma Wallace, age 37. The Buckner family, including mother, Kimberly; father, Vic; 18yearold daughter, Kaitlin; and 6yearold daughter, Emma. A deputy sheriff, Corporal Nate Carrigan, age 35. Renee Benjamin, age 30. Josh Higbee, age 31. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I understand the Republican majority has pulled a bill from the floor agenda that would have created a new loophole allowing terror suspects to get a gun. That is good news. The bill they pulled was the CornynNRA gun lobby bill, and we are pleased that they pulled that bill. It is a terrible proposal that will only make matters worse in our country. But now it is time to bring up the meaningful bipartisan bill, the no fly, no buy legislation, and the meaningful background check legislation. And know this: until you do so, Mr. Speaker, we are not going away. We are not going anywhere because this issue is not going away. Putting aside Orlando for a moment—the last gentleman’s comments—since the House gaveled back in on Tuesday, nearly 200 people have been killed or injured due to gun violence. I don’t know how many more people must fall victim to gun violence before this body, before House Republicans will get the message. The time for bold action is now. I do know my Democratic colleagues and I are prepared to keep up this fight for as long as we have to to get meaningful gun legislation passed. f 
THE THREAT OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express grave concern over the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. What we need is a comprehensive strategy to destroy terrorist organizations like ISIS. Instead, the administration is ramping up the release of Guantanamo Bay detainees. Make no mistake, these detainees are the worst of the worst. One former detainee has become a leader of al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen. Another, released last month, was Osama bin Laden’s bodyguard. Just weeks before the Olympics, here we are again. Authorities in Brazil are on the hunt for a former detainee who went missing. With another two dozen detainees cleared for this summer, I worked to include key safeguards in next year’s National Defense Authorization Act, like requiring written agreements with foreign nations that accept these GTMO transfers. I introduced legislation with Senator STEVE DAINES to block all GTMO transfers until these safeguards are signed into law or until the end of the year. The President wants to empty GTMO and bring the remaining terrorists to U.S. soil. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow these terrorist detainees to put American lives at risk. 
CLOSE THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to once again call upon Members of Congress to enact some commonsense gun reform because I really believe that we are misusing the word ‘‘reform’’ every time we talk about this issue. Reform means a change for the better. It doesn’t mean just to go through a process. It means a change for the better. Mr. Speaker, we have seen that our gun laws need to change. I am very emotional for nine souls in my congressional district who lost their lives because of an inadequate, nonsensical background check law that says that no matter what the situation might be, if you wait for 3 days, you can go get the gun. Irrespective of your mental condition, irrespective of your background, irrespective of your intentions, you can still buy the gun. We need to close this Charleston loophole, and we need to enact a law that says, if you are not qualified to buy a plane ticket, you are not qualified to buy a gun. f 
A FAILURE OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, the revelations of the last few days have been, at best, an injustice and, at worst, government corruption of the highest degree. Earlier this week, FBI Director James Comey acknowledged that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent or received 110 emails that contained classified information through her unsecured server. He went as far as to say that Secretary Clinton’s actions were ‘‘extremely careless.’’ Despite the FBI Director’s harsh criticism of Secretary Clinton’s ability or inability to protect highly sensitive material, it appears she will walk away without punishment. In an era where cybersecurity has become one of the most important pillars of U.S. national security, this carelessness is totally unacceptable. What is even more unacceptable is that the Nation’s top prosecutor met with Secretary Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, in private 1 week before the Justice Department decided not to press charges. Mr. Speaker, it is possible Secretary Clinton threatened the security of this great country. There are those who have committed far lesser crimes who have faced far harsher consequences. The Attorney General’s decision not to prosecute Secretary Clinton is a failure of our justice system. In God we trust. 
NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, last week on this floor, I told a story of a 911 call that I took where an 11year old girl was murdered at the hands of her uncle. Her name was Yajaira. Today I want to tell you about Ethan Esparza. In 2006, when I was mayor of Pomona, Ethan was shot and killed while he was playing in his front yard during his birthday party. He would have turned 4 years old the next day. 
The murders of Yajaira and Ethan were completely senseless, but they are not rare. Every day, 91 people are killed because of gun violence. In the United States, you are more than 10 times likely to die because of a firearm than in any other developed country. We have a problem, a problem that isn’t going to be solved by simply putting our heads in the sand. It is time to stop this silence. We aren’t going to solve this. Now is the time to act. Now is the time to have a discussion about it. 
REMEMBERING PENN STATE STUDENT MADISON HILL (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of 19yearold Madison ‘‘Maddie’’ Hill, a student at Penn State University, who, sadly, passed away after a long battle with cancer last week. Madison was not originally from Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District. In fact, she was a native of York County, but she was no stranger to Penn State University even before she started classes there as a student. Following her cancer diagnosis, Madison benefited from the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, or THON, the largest studentrun philanthropy in the world, which raises funds and awareness for the fight against pediatric cancer. Upon enrolling in Penn State, Madison worked to provide that same support for other cancer patients as a volunteer and family relations cochair with THON. She was also a member of the university’s Blue & White Society. I join the entire Penn State community in mourning the loss of Madison and offer my thoughts and prayers to her family and friends. 
b1215 FOURYEAROLD BOY SHOT IN ALTADENA (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, yesterday morning, I woke up to the news that, overnight, a 4year old boy in my district, in Altadena, California, became one of the latest victims of gun violence. Salvador Esparza III was sitting on his front porch with a family friend when a car drove up, fired at least 13 rounds, and drove off, leaving two bodies. Hours later, we finally heard the tragic news. Little Salvador was dead. I was heartbroken. Now, I know the doctors did everything they could to save his life. But what are we doing in Congress? Nothing. Another life cut short, another family torn apart, another day of silence from Congress. The NRA tells us the solution is more guns. Well, we already have more guns than any other country in the world, and it is not working. Having more guns would not have helped 4 yearold Salvador. But we could have. Enough is enough. We must pass no fly, no buy and we must pass universal background checks. f 
AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES AWARENESS WEEK (Mr. BENISHEK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, this week marks Aquatic Invasive Species Awareness Week. This is a good time to consider the threat that invasive species pose to all of our districts. Northern Michigan’s economy depends on the Great Lakes and our beautiful outdoors. Invasive species represent a direct threat to our way of life. Even before I came to Congress, I was working on invasive species issues. I live on an inland lake, and we had a really difficult invasive weed get out of control. I have been working for years with my neighbors to control it, so I know just how difficult, and important, it is to get local buyin for this fight. Volunteers throughout northern Michigan are working right now to attack invasive species on the ground. State officials are working to educate the public on how we can lessen the chance of spreading these invasive species. These efforts are in addition to the great work in my district by professionals at institutions like Northern Michigan University and the Hammond Bay Biological Station. I hope this week we will bring further attention to this fight and help Congress to focus more resources on this issue. 
ADDRESSING THE URGENT NEED TO PASS NO FLY, NO BUY AND BACKGROUND CHECKS (Ms. KUSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to stress the urgent need to pass legislation to keep our communities safe from those with evil intent and who wish to harm innocent Americans. I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, and I believe we must uphold the tradition of my home State of New Hampshire for responsible, law abiding gun ownership. But as we saw in Orlando, it is far too easy for individuals with evil intent to get ahold of firearms and target innocent American lives. That is why I strongly urge my colleagues to pass legislation to ban those on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns. What is more, we must increase background checks to prevent tragedies like the one in my home State of New Hampshire in 1997, when an incredibly disturbed man fatally shot Judge Vickie Bunnell, two State troopers, and a newspaper editor. Individuals like this should not be given access to lethal weapons. Rather, we should give access to mental health treatment. Let’s put aside party politics and do what is right to keep our communities safe. f 
NETWORKS’ COVERAGE OF ORLANDO ATTACK BIASED (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Media Research Center recently issued a report highlighting the three major news networks’ slanted coverage of the Orlando terrorist attack. The Center found that ABC’s, NBC’s, and CBS’ broadcast network programs ‘‘flooded their shows with statements favoring gun control over gun rights by a ratio of 8 to 1.’’ The Orlando attacker was a radical Islamic extremist who pledged his allegiance to ISIS before committing the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001. Instead of focusing on gun control, the liberal national media should tell the American people the full story about the Orlando attacker’s radical Islamic views as the cause of these killings. Not a single gun control measure in Congress would have prevented his actions. 
GUN LOBBY (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, gun violence permeates every aspect of our lives, from the streets of Chicago to law enforcement officers to Congress. Everybody is affected by what is going on. But we can do something about it by passing two bills that we have been talking about: the no fly, no buy and universal background checks. Neither is a solution to the entire problem, but both are good steps. The reason we haven’t done anything is simple: the $15 million a year gun manufacturing industry. And by preventing action here through their campaign donations and Capitol Hill lobbyists, they are controlling the discussion. When I can’t act, when you can’t act, this House is being controlled by the gun industry. We—all of us, on both sides of the aisle—are looking to blame each other when the real culprits are the gun manufacturers. 
REPLACE OBAMACARE (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘Do Democrats really realize how difficult it has been on workingclass Americans to finance ObamaCare?’’ This question was asked at a townhall with a Democratic nominee by an Ohio woman who saw her premium more than double, from $490 a month to $1,081 a month. The answer she received? Just keep shopping on the exchange until she finds a better deal. For the millions of Americans who continue to see their costs skyrocket, this is not an acceptable answer. From losing coverage, soaring premiums, and excess regulations, this system is simply unsustainable. Rather than propping up a failing system with temporary, costly fixes, let’s replace it with the patientcentered policies that actually work. That is what Republicans are proposing to do. One with more choices, not mandates, one that increases flexibility in coverage, spurs competition so rates will go down and not up, and puts doctors and patients, not D.C. bureaucrats, back in charge of healthcare decisions. These are just some of the commonsense ideas Republicans are advancing, and they really do represent a better way for people’s choices. ObamaCare has not, is not, and will not work. Let’s start giving people more choices and the answers they deserve. 
KEEP AMERICANS SAFE FROM GUN VIOLENCE (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I urge Speaker RYAN to bring commonsense gun violence prevention legislation to the floor this week. Justice will never be served for the victims of Tucson, Aurora, Newtown, Charleston, San Bernardino, and Orlando as long as this body refuses to act and once again accepts the status quo. I support the Second Amendment and the right of Americans to own firearms, but I believe it is the responsibility of this body to ensure effective laws are in place to keep all Americans safe from gun violence. Congress did nothing after 20 children were fatally shot in Newtown in 2012, and nothing following what happened in Orlando, where 49 innocent people were murdered. Congress must pass legislation that will require comprehensive background checks and close the gun show loophole. That is why I am a cosponsor of the ThompsonKing legislation. We must make progress in gun safety and mental health awareness and support gun safety lock laws. PRAYERS FOR BEN CRAIG (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ben Craig, a longtime community leader in Overland Park, in my district, who is, sadly, battling liver cancer. Ben is known around town as the ‘‘Grandfather of Overland Park’’ and ‘‘Mr. Johnson County.’’ As a founder of the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce, he helped develop and expand Johnson County Community College, a crown jewel in the metro area. As a member of our Rotary Club, Ben has set the bar pretty high, with 52 years of perfect attendance. Ben truly embodies our Rotary motto ‘‘service above self.’’ Whether it was raising money for the college, Harvesters, or for one of my family’s favorite destinations and landmarks in Overland Park, the Deanna Rose Children’s Farmstead, he encourages others to step up and be part of our community and to give back. I consider Ben a mentor and friend, and I am grateful to know him. His impact will be felt for generations. Mr. Speaker, please join me in saying a prayer for Ben and his family in these hard times as he fights against this horrible disease. f 
VOTE ON COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION (Ms. TSONGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, my home State of Massachusetts has enacted some of the most comprehensive gun violence prevention laws in the Nation, including universal background checks. Thanks to these commonsense reforms, Massachusetts has one of the lowest rates of gun deaths in the Nation. Nevertheless, lax gun laws in other States make us a net importer of firearms, and we are certainly not immune from the tragic impacts of gun violence. Americans have a right to be free from violence in our own communities, in our homes, in our schools, in our churches, and in our workplace. But it is clear that the States cannot do it alone. Congress must do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, domestic abusers, and the dangerously mentally ill. You can’t know if someone falls into one of these categories without a background check. Mr. Speaker, our constituents sent us here to cast a vote on their behalf, and that is what we should be doing. Let us have a vote on commonsense, bipartisan legislation that allows background checks for all gun sales. WHERE THERE IS HELP, THERE IS HOPE (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, today, there are over 11 million Americans struggling without proper treatment and care for mental health illnesses. Our system is riddled with inefficiencies, as various agencies patch together different programs with little to no coordination. Because of this massive failure, patients far too often end up in the criminal justice system or on the streets, because the services are just not available. This week, Congress took decisive action to fix this problem by passing a bill that I helped introduce with Representative TIMMURPHY of Pennsylvania, 422–2. Our bill will genuinely save lives and improve the quality of life for families all across this Nation. The bipartisan Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act is a perfect example of what we can accomplish when we set aside partisan differences and get to work for the people that we represent. This bill prioritizes treatment to proactively prevent tragedy, emphasizing programs and resources that focus on getting patients the care they need. In short, Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill takes mental illness out of the shadows of ignorance, because we know that where there is help, there is hope. 
GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, I joined my colleagues in an historic sitin on the House floor, demanding action on gun violence in the wake of yet another mass shooting. Since then, I have heard from hundreds of Rhode Islanders who, like over 80 percent of Americans and a high percentage of gun owners themselves, support our efforts for commonsense legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands and to address this public health crisis. Frustratingly, sadly, and inconceivably, Republican leaders in this Chamber continue to ignore the demands of the American people and, most especially and sadly, continue to ignore the pleas of so many victims of gun violence and their families. Republicans trot out old, tired arguments, saying that we oppose the Second Amendment, that we oppose due process, that backgrounds checks are ineffective. Mr. Speaker, these assertions are simply not true. But rather than allow an open debate and a vote, Republicans continue to follow the playbook of the gun lobby. But, Mr. Speaker, we will not allow silence to fill that void of leadership. 
Until the House acts on meaningful gun violence prevention legislation, my colleagues and I will continue to speak for Americans who demand action. We will be silent no more. 
b1230 MICHELLE KELLYLOVE WAS NOT JUST A NUMBER (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, this is a photo of my former coworker, Michelle KellyLove. Michelle and I worked together at the same company in Los Angeles in the early nineties, and she was kind and funny and warmhearted, a person who was very generous, and a dear friend of mine. On February 27 of this year, Michelle was dropping off her son, Jordan, at his home in a quiet neighborhood in Carson, California. They were parked in her car in front of the house when they were attacked by a driveby shooter. Both Michelle and her son were struck multiple times and died at the scene. Michelle’s mother, the grandmother of Jordan, was in the back seat and survived. Michelle’s funeral was one of the saddest I have ever attended. She and her son were taken from us so randomly and so suddenly. You have heard a lot of numbers and statistics related to gun deaths, but Michelle was not just a number. She was friend and a mother and had a long life ahead of her. Her 27year old son was not just a number. We cannot stand by and do nothing as our friends and neighbors continue to die. We have lost too many lives to gun violence. The time for action is now. Please. 
GUN VIOLENCE LEGISLATION (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, today I also rise on behalf of the families who have lost loved ones to gun violence, including in my very own district in Isla Vista, California, on May 23, 2014. That horrific act killed 6 and injured 14—young people full of life and promise: Katherine Cooper, Veronica Weiss, Christopher Martinez, Cheng Yuan Hong, George Chen, and Weihan Wang. When these lives were tragically cut short, our community banded together to say ‘‘Not One More’’ life should be lost due to gun violence. But that message has fallen on deaf ears with the leadership of this House, resulting in countless Americans wondering each day if their community will be next. This is simply unacceptable. We cannot delay action any longer. Mr. Speaker, this House must vote on a bill to address the gun violence epidemic in our country. Americans deserve a bill that will truly make our country safer, and they deserve a bill that seeks to ensure ‘‘Not One More’’ can become a reality. f 
BIPARTISAN, COMMONSENSE LAWS TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE (Ms. PINGREE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago I joined with many of my colleagues here on the House floor to demand a debate on commonsense gun legislation to increase background checks and keep terrorists from buying guns. Despite the fact that the microphones and C–SPAN cameras were turned off, the discussion we held over the next 24 hours was seen and heard by millions of Americans. It was seen and heard because my colleagues and I took out our smartphones, and we took photos and streamed video, and we tweeted. We posted to Facebook and we broadcast on Periscope. We call this Chamber ‘‘the people’s House.’’ In the time that I have been serving here, there has never been a moment that has felt more like the people’s House than that 25 hours. Yet now we hear that some are calling for us to be punished for bringing that debate and discussion to the American people. It is ‘‘behavior unbecoming’’ of the House of Representatives, they say. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of what my colleagues and I did, and if that is what it takes to get us a vote on bipartisan, commonsense laws to prevent gun violence, I hope we will do it again. 
GUNS AND OUR PRIORITIES (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, there is something seriously wrong with the priorities in Congress. Time and time again, this body is choosing to put political posturing above the interests, safety, and wellbeing of the American people. Earlier today, I attended an Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing that was termed an emergency because the committee Republicans did not approve of a decision by career officials at the FBI and Justice Department to end the email case involving Secretary Clinton. In this hyperpartisan era, that counts as an emergency. But the continuing plague of gun violence, one that takes over 32,000 innocent lives a year, has been, once again, put on the back burner. There is no sense of urgency. No bill, no vote. Mr. Speaker, this is no way to take care of the American people’s interests. 
GUN SAFETY (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘Teen killed in shooting that led to crash near ER in Charlotte.’’ ‘‘Man shot and killed in uptown Charlotte.’’ ‘‘Man found shot to death in Thomasville July 4th.’’ ‘‘Man shot in Freeman Mills Shopping Center.’’ ‘‘Shooting outside Florida Street Grocery Store in Greensboro.’’ ‘‘WinstonSalem woman caught in crossfire.’’ The media and my Republican colleagues have focused attention on which words we have used instead of the need to define the terms. As a former educator, let me define the word ‘‘epidemic.’’ Webster defines it as something ‘‘affecting a disproportionately large number of individuals within a population, a community, or a region at the same time.’’ The headlines I cited earlier define the term ‘‘gun violence epidemic,’’ an epidemic faced in my home State of North Carolina and across this country, an epidemic so vast that it took the life of Kevin Rodas, a 7year old boy shot while playing in the front yard of his Charlotte home. Let’s cure these epidemics. Pass sensible, bipartisan gun safety legislation to prevent future acts of gun violence like Orlando or the one that took little Kevin’s life back in my district. f 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ) laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. 524, COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2016; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 809 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 809 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider the conference report to accompany the bill (S. 524) to authorize the Attorney General to 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BYRNE. I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 809 facilitates the process to allow us to go to conference with the Senate on the National Defense Authorization Act. The resolution also provides for consideration of a conference report related to our efforts to combat the opioid crisis that is wreaking havoc in communities all across the United States. I want to talk first about the need to get to conference with the Senate on the National Defense Authorization Act. For 54 straight years, the House and Senate have come together to fulfill our most important responsibility: to provide for the common defense. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk a lot about regular order. Well, there is no greater example of regular order than the National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation has gone from the subcommittee level to the full committee, to the full bodies of both Houses; and now we need to continue the process by allowing for this House to enter into negotiations with the Senate. Between the House and the Senate, hundreds of amendments have been adopted to this legislation. Members from both sides of the aisle have had an opportunity to have their input on this legislation, and the separate bills passed both by the House and the Senate have bipartisan support. Now, there are some differences between the House and the Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act, and that is why we have to have the conference committee process. This will allow us to iron out our differences. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I can personally attest to just how important it is we get a strong, reformbased NDAA signed into law this year. Our military is in the midst of a readiness crisis. Aircraft cannot fly due to maintenance issues. There are even reports of mechanics having to take parts off of planes inside museums in an effort to repair damaged aircraft. Think about that for a minute. The United States, home to the greatest fighting force on the face of the Earth, is having to use plane parts from museums in an effort to keep some of our aircraft operational. That is simply stunning. And readiness is so important these days given the serious threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism. Every morning, it seems we wake up to reports of another attack. Whether it is in Bangladesh, Baghdad, Istanbul, Kabul, Saudi Arabia, or right here in Orlando, or San Bernardino, these attacks just reinforce the fact that radical Islamic terrorism must be defeated. The NDAA is also important because it is a great opportunity to put reforms in place at the Pentagon. Whether it is reducing bureaucratic obstacles, improving military health care, or updating the command structure, the NDAA is the perfect tool to ensure efficiency and effectiveness from the Pentagon. So I hope my colleagues from both sides of the aisle will join me in voting to get us to conference so we can keep the streak alive of passing a strong NDAA each year. The other portion of this rule provides for consideration of the conference report dealing with the opioid crisis. I recently heard a story of a young man from southwest Alabama who suffered an injury playing sports. He was prescribed opioidbased pain medication by his doctor, but, unfortunately, he became addicted. Next thing he knew, his addiction had spiraled out of control and he found himself using heroin. Ultimately, he became seriously ill. Thankfully, this young man was able to enter a treatment program and receive help, but not everyone who suffers from opioid addiction is so fortunate. Studies show that approximately 46,000 Americans die because of a drug overdose each year. That number adds up to over 130 deaths a day. Tragically, young Americans are disproportionately impacted. One of the worst things about opioid abuse is that it can start so innocently. Whether it is a high school athlete who suffers an injury or an individual who undergoes a medical procedure as simple as dental work, no American is immune from this tragedy. That is why this legislation is so very important. It authorizes new programs and reforms others to ensure that those struggling with opioid addition can get the help that they need. The bill includes new grants to States to carry out comprehensive opioid abuse responses with education, treatment, and recovery efforts, and prescription drug monitoring programs. The bill also has multiple provisions dealing with prevention, including a new intergovernmental task force to identify, review, and, as appropriate, determine whether there are gaps or inconsistencies between best practices for chronic and acute pain management. Treatment and recovery are also a priority, with reforms to multiple existing grant programs and a new grant program to provide grants to community organizations to develop, expand, and enhance recovery services and build connections between recovery networks, including physicians, the criminal justice system, and employers. b1245 The bill also helps women, families, and veterans. This includes reauthorization of a grant program for residential treatment for pregnant and postpartum women who have an opioid abuse disorder and a new pilot program to enhance the flexibility of funds so States can more broadly support familybased services for pregnant and postpartum women and their children. Moreover, this bill contains other commonsense reforms such as clarifying that pharmacists coordinating with a doctor and patient may not fill the entire amount of a prescription for a Schedule II substance, such as opioids. Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the numerous and important pieces of this legislation. I am pleased to report that 200 different organizations from every corner of our country have already come out in support of this conference report. Now, this bill probably doesn’t do everything that every Member would like for it to do. In my time up here, I have yet to see a perfect bill. But this is a good bill, and I honestly doubt there is anything in this bill that my colleagues disagree with. I understand some of my colleagues have concerns over funding, but let me remind my colleagues about the important distinction between appropriations and authorizing. This bill authorizes programs to address the opioid crisis. The Appropriations Committee has made clear that they are going to do everything that they can to provide funding for these programs, and I take them at their word. But putting funding in an authorization bill is not the proper way to address this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I worry we are seeing a larger issue here that started with the Zika virus legislation a few weeks ago. My colleagues on the other side demand action on issues, the process plays out, the House and Senate work together on legislation, and then my colleagues on the other side announce their opposition to very similar bills to the ones they previously supported. Let’s not forget that the House passed our opioid legislation by a vote of 400–5, and the Senate passed their bill by a vote of 94–1. Neither of those bills included funding. So it is stunning that now many of my colleagues on the other side say that they are going to oppose this bill. Mr. Speaker, I worry that this is about politics instead of policy. I fear that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want an issue to debate on the campaign trail instead of actual solutions to the problems facing our country. I sincerely hope that that is not the case because the American people deserve better than that. They can turn on their TVs every night and get enough political theater. But here in this body we should rise above that temptation and actually work on solutions. The minority will not get everything they want. That is the nature of compromise, and that is the realty of being in the minority. But this has been a truly bipartisan process, and I hope it will not fall victim to political grandstanding. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 809 and the underlying legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule today providing for consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017, a bill that the President has said he would veto, and the conference report to accompany S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. Many of us support the underlying bill, but, unfortunately, it doesn’t allow for—despite nine times having funding being waived—any funding to deal with defeating the cycle of addiction or the health issues around opioid abuse. So while it is an innocuous bill and might help a little bit, it is in no way commensurate with the challenge that families across our country face in dealing with opioid addiction. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would require the House to consider the bipartisan no fly, no buy legislation which would bar the sale of firearms and explosives to those on the FBI’s terrorist watch list. My amendment would not prevent the House from considering either of the underlying measures of this rule. It would simply give the House an opportunity to finally vote on keeping terrorists from assembling arsenals of weapons legally in our country. Mr. Speaker, we can’t wait any longer for Congress to take meaningful action. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Without question, the NDAA is a very important and serious bill. However, the bill before us today is one that the President has said he would veto. I have argued on this floor in an amendment that I supported a 1 percent cut to the authorization levels. By spending more on the military than we can afford as a country and plunging ourselves deeper into debt, we make ourselves less secure, not more secure. By making ourselves economically beholden to countries like China and Saudi Arabia, we are less secure rather than more secure. Frankly, this bill is more of the same, and if it passes and were to become law—which it won’t because the President would veto it—it would also make it less secure. But this rule and this day it is notable for what we are not doing rather than what we are doing. We are not under this rule considering two simple, plain, commonsense pieces of legislation that everybody knows will help protect American lives and prevent terrorist attacks in our Nation. One is simply to require a background check when a person obtains a gun. Another would prevent terrorists from assembling arsenals of weapons. In my home State of Colorado, we already have universal background checks, and they have led to law enforcement arresting 114 fugitives since the beginning of the year. It is our duty to simply vote on these bills that strengthen and enhance our Second Amendment rights by ensuring that lawabiding gun owners will continue to be able to purchase guns and keeping guns out of the hands of violent criminals and those who don’t have the legal right to own them. Both of these bills do this, and each has over 100 cosponsors, including Members on both sides of the aisle. As we stand here today, we are still reeling from the deadliest mass shooting in our country’s history nearly 1 month ago. Pulse nightclub in Orlando was a targeted act of terror against the gay community, our allies, and the entire Nation. In my home State of Colorado, we have been hard hit with mass shootings: Columbine, Aurora, and the Planned Parenthood center in Colorado Springs to name a few. It is time for action, and the simple, commonsense measures before us offer a good first step to ensure that we get that done. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Xavier Arnold, a victim of gun violence who never ever received a moment of silence on the House floor. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield to the gentleman from California—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend for one moment. The Chair would advise that all time has been yielded for the purpose of debate only. Does the gentleman from Alabama yield for the purpose of this unanimous consent request? Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my earlier announcement that all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only, and I will not yield for any other purpose. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama does not yield; therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Kelly Russler; Jayden, her son, and Laing, her son; victims of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman from Alabama has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. She is a leader on the issue of reducing gun violence. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background check legislation to honor the memory of Serge Pierre Dumas, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman from Alabama has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. I ask the gentleman from Alabama: How many of us have to come down requesting this until you grant it? Well, your silence speaks words. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. HAHN) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation in honor of the memory of my friend, Michele Love, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman from Alabama has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. She is a leader on the issue of reducing gun violence. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation in honor of Elizabeth Janie Woods, a victim of gun violence who never received a single moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman from Alabama has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Trooper Chad P. Dermyer, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman from Alabama has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Jamie Wilson, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman from Alabama has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. AL GREEN ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Mr. Rayland ‘‘Ray Ray’’ Maryland, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to inquire of the gentleman from Alabama how many people we need to have more come down here until our request is granted? 
Mr. BYRNE. May I ask the Chair if I am on the time of the gentleman from Colorado in answering his question? Mr. POLIS. You are. It is my time. I am yielding for an answer. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is speaking on his time. Mr. POLIS. Reclaiming my time, the parliamentary inquiry in his asking about the time should not be detracted from my time, so that, as well as this, need to be subtracted. Now, we go back to my time, and I yield to the gentleman to ask him how many people we need to come down here so we can have our vote? Mr. BYRNE. We are here today to consider—— Mr. POLIS. Reclaiming my time, that is not an answer. It is a simple question with a number. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. MEEKS ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Davon Jones, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Dajae Coleman from my district, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. EDWARDS ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Keiwuan Murray, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Dana Rhoden, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Gino Nicholas, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I just received devastating news in a story that was just broken by Politico: House Republicans indefinitely delay gun control votes. They have indefinitely postponed a vote on the antiterrorism package leaving Congress with no legislative response to last month’s massacre in Orlando. b1300 I would hope that this new information will lead the gentleman from Alabama to consider this very important request from my colleague, Mr. HUFFMAN . Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Tanya Skeen, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, given the new information that I entered, with regard to what has just broke a the Politico article, I think it would be important to hear from Mr. BYRNE again about whether he would entertain a unanimous consent request at this time, understanding his previous answer was no. So I would like, Mr. Speaker, if you will, you to pose that question to him for consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman from Colorado yielding to the gentleman from Alabama? Mr. POLIS. I am not yielding. I am asking the Chair to confirm that, in fact, his stated preference is still valid, and if he would ask the gentleman from Alabama if that is still the case. The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is still the Chair’s understanding that the gentleman from Alabama will not yield for such a request. Therefore, the previous unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LARSON ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of the memory of Delhaun Jackson, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the floor. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK ) for a unanimous consent request. Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Damond Dawson, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Hanna Rhoden and Christopher Roden, Sr., victims of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the gentleman from Alabama how many people we need to have come down until the gentleman from Alabama would be willing to simply entertain a unanimous consent request to have the vote? I understand that the gentleman from Alabama is opposed to the underlying measures. If a majority of the House is, so be it. But at least I would like to know how many requests we need to make until we can simply have this vote. I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Alabama for an answer. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair continues to understand that the gentleman from Alabama has not yielded for the purpose of these unanimous consent requests. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield the gentleman from Alabama from my time to ask how many more unanimous consent requests we need to have until we can have this vote.

I do so, Mr. Speaker, in honor of Shelly Williams, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire again of the gentleman from Alabama how many more requests we need to make until this very simple request is granted to allow us a vote on these bills. I am happy to yield for an answer as to how many more people we need to request a vote on these bills. 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, we are here today on House Resolution 809—— Mr. POLIS. Reclaiming my time, I am in control of the time. I yielded for an answer. The gentleman from Alabama didn’t give it. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ) for the purpose of a very important unanimous consent request that would save lives and prevent terrorism. Ms. DELAURO.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, now that, in addition to so many rankandfile Members having made this request, the Democratic leader and the Democratic whip have joined in this request personally and have come down here, I would like to ask the gentleman from Alabama if he would be willing to consider the unanimous consent request at this point. I am happy to yield for an answer. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 809 is on the National Defense Authorization Act—— Mr. POLIS. Reclaiming my time, again, I think no matter how the gentleman from Alabama says it, the simple translation of that is: no, we won’t consider that request. So at this point, we have a very important request that would save lives and help prevent terrorist attacks in our country. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) for a unanimous consent request. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Devin Hamb, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear that the various speakers have not embellished to this point; is that correct? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has not deducted time to this point. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Laquan McDonald, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of the memory of Mike Dawid, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. DAVIS) for the purpose of a very important and timely unanimous consent request. Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Cora Wilson, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, that strikes close to home, I would say to Mrs. DAVIS. That is the name of my daughter as well, Cora; so that is particularly emotional to me as a father. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Alicia Norman, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor.

H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of the memory of Reid Williams, a victim of gun violence who never received his moment of silence on the House floor.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of Zanyrah Taylor, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I inquire of the gentleman from Alabama how many more motions for unanimous consent we need to make until it is granted and we, simply, allow an upor down vote on this issue? Again, the silence speaks volumes not only from the gentleman from Alabama but from the Republican majority that continues to prevent a vote on these commonsense measures to reduce deaths and violence and terrorism. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SERRANO ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Malcolm Winffel, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. BECERRA ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. He is the chair of the Democratic Caucus. Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent—because it is more than just time for a moment of silence—that we bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Shannon Johnson, a victim of gun violence, who died during the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, who never received a moment of silence on this House floor, to dignify the passing and the need to do something for him and his family. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentleman from Colorado will be charged. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. CAPPS ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, which is the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation. I do so to honor the memory of Welland ‘‘Buddy’’ Short, a victim of gun violence who, himself, never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ) for the purpose of a very important unanimous consent request. Mr. SHERMAN.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Justin Michael Murray, from my district—a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS.

Davis, who was assassinated at the New York City Council on July 23, 2003, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor his memory. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request that would save lives and prevent terrorist attacks in our country. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Jerome Wright, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. EDWARDS ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Jadarrion Spinks, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, given that not only have we had so many Members from across the country make this unanimous consent request but that they have been joined by every member of the Democratic leadership, I inquire of the gentleman from Alabama if he would be willing to entertain the next unanimous consent request that will be made shortly by the gentlewoman from California. I yield to the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, we are here to speak on House Resolution 809, the National Defense Authorization Act. Mr. POLIS. In reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LORETTA  SANCHEZ ), who has a very important unanimous consent request that would save lives and prevent terrorist attacks. Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I thank my colleague from Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Kiara Kinard, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. VAN HOLLEN ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of the memory of Mercy Cordova, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence here on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I point out, on my own time, that granting this request does not take away from considering the other two underlying bills. They, too, will be considered, but it simply means that these additional two bills to reduce gun violence, preventing terrorists from assembling arsenals legally in our own country, and making sure that convicted felons can’t legally acquire firearms, are common sense. I think they 
would pass this House fairly overwhelmingly. We are simply saying, in addition to the bills that are already being considered—which some of us may personally be opposed to in the case of NDAA, but we are not standing in the way of those. We are simply allowing for the consideration of these additional bills. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of a unanimous consent request only, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY). Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of Gary Rhoden, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) for a unanimous consent request that would prevent terrorists from assembling arsenals that they would use to cause harm to our fellow Americans. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of the memory of Jones Pidcock, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I was truly hoping that the motion by Ms. TITUS would be accepted because, frankly, Ms. TITUS’ unanimous consent request would have saved lives, prevented convicted felons from acquiring firearms and would have prevented people on the terrorist watch list from silently assembling arsenals for them to commit terrorist acts in our country. While I am disappointed that Ms. TITUS’ unanimous consent request was rejected out of hand, I yield to—and I am hopeful that the gentleman from Alabama will accept—the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON ) for the purpose of a very important unanimous consent request. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Christopher Houston, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, a point of parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Alabama yield for a parliamentary inquiry? Mr. BYRNE. I do not. Mr. Speaker, I note far the record—— Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, a point of parliamentary inquiry. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask the Chair to bring the House to order. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, a point of parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized on his own time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I note for the record that the Member who just spoke has made the same unanimous consent request three times. I would also note that other Members have made the same unanimous consent requests multiple times, and the Chair has indicated that he cannot entertain that request. Mr. Speaker, for the record, at some point, this ceases to be an effort to debate the issue before the House and, rather, becomes an effort to obstruct the House from completing its work. I reserve the balance of my time. PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY  
Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, a point of parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, how is the gentleman from Alabama able to seize my time before I have even made my opening statement and simply speak on his own time while I control the time? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair was alternating recognition between the minority manager and the majority manager. The gentleman from Alabama was recognized using his own time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, we have a gentleman with us here today from the great State of Missouri, who has a very important unanimous consent request that would save lives and prevent terrorists from doing harm to our fellow countrymen. I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Michael Brown, one of my constituents and a victim of gun violence at the hands of a trigger happy policeman. Michael Brown never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentleman from Missouri will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. b1330 Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out on my own time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized. Mr. POLIS. The gentleman from Alabama mentioned the word ‘‘obstruction.’’ And, Mr. Speaker, I would like you to consider—and, Mr. Speaker, I would like the American people to consider—who and which party is obstructing here when there is a very simple request for a vote that so many Members of this body feel fervently about. Those who stand in the way of that vote are those who are obstructing, not those who simply seek a vote to prevent terrorists from acquiring explosives and firearms. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROYBAL  ALLARD ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Jordan Croft, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MATSUI ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of the memory of Lana Carlson, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the gentleman from Alabama how long he plans to continue obstructing this body and preventing this body from going about its business to vote on these underlying bills by objecting to these very simple, commonsense, unanimous consent requests to prevent terrorists from acquiring explosives and firearms. Again, the silence speaks volumes. It sounds like the Republicans and the gentleman from Alabama plan on continuing to obstruct this body from going about their business. However, luckily, thanks to the gentlewoman from New Jersey, there is another chance for this body to accept a very important unanimous consent request. I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Tre Lane, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on this floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ) for the purpose of a very important unanimous consent request to prevent terrorists from silently acquiring arsenals that they would kill our fellow Americans with. 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation. Here is Zina Daniel, who was murdered when her exhusband bought a weapon from the Internet. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentlewoman will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, we are joined by the ranking member of the Rules Committee, and I hope that my colleague from Alabama will be willing to grant her very important request that she is about to make that will prevent convicted felons from acquiring guns legally and also help keep explosives and weapons out of the hands of terrorists. I am proud to yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGH TER) for a unanimous consent request. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Valerie Short, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON ) for the purpose of a critical and timely unanimous consent request. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, a bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of Kendrick Forrest, a victim of gun violence from my district who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, in the face of Republican obstructionism on this important issue, I am joined by a colleague from the great State of California. I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request in an attempt to break through this gridlock. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Jerry Nguyen, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, would that we run out of victims. Mr. Speaker, would that we run out of victims, but, tragically, that is not the case. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Davon Barrett, a victim of gun violence who never received his moment of silence here on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS.

They are both victims of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR ) who has a very important and timely unanimous consent request to prevent terrorists from acquiring arsenals to attack our fellow Americans. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of Kenneth Cornelious Loggins, a victim of gun violence. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BROWNLEY ) who has a very important and timely unanimous consent request that would save lives. Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Joanne Woods, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of action on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ) how many more Members need to make this very simple request until it is a simple courtesy they agree to simply hold these votes. I would be happy to yield for an answer. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado yields to the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. POLIS. Reclaiming my time, I hear nothing but silence. Mr. BYRNE. Well, I thought he yielded to me for—— Mr. POLIS. Not to yield for an answer—absolutely. How many more—— Mr. BYRNE. Do you yield or not? Mr. POLIS. I did. You were standing—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized. Mr. BYRNE. You didn’t allow me to say a word. Mr. POLIS. How many more requests—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized. Mr. POLIS. Do we need to make? Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, we are here to talk about House Resolution 809 that deals with the National Defense Authorization Act—— Mr. POLIS. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker. Mr. BYRNE. And an opioid bill and not anything else. And I—— Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is out of order. Mr. BYRNE. I can yield—— Mr. POLIS. The gentleman is out of order. I reclaim my time, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized. Mr. POLIS. Yes. And yet the gentleman from Alabama continues to obstruct the consideration of those very underlying measures by not granting this simple request, this very simple request to consider these two bills. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank my colleague.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. CAPPS ) for a unanimous consent request. Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to please bring up H.R. 1217. It is a bipartisan bill, the expanded background checks legislation, and I am doing this today in honor of this beautiful young mother of 2 from Chicago, a victim of gun violence. She never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentlewoman from California will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request only. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, hoping you will change your misinformed judgment, again, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Enedia Branch, a victim of gun violence who never received one moment of silence on this House floor.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ) for the purpose of a very important unanimous consent request. Mr. LANGEVIN.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentleman from Rhode Island will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I wish that we had the time to adequately remember all of these victims like Doris Dooley and so many others, but given the limited time we have, I think our priority at this point is breaking through the Republican obstruction and achieving a simple upordown vote on these commonsense, bipartisan bills. To that end, I yield to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. EDWARDS ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Betty Mungin; her daughter, Alexis Mungin; her daughter, 8 yearold Armani Mungin, victims of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for a very important unanimous consent request that will save lives. Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Javier JorgeReyes, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of action on this House floor. In his memory, we beg the Republican leadership, please, let us have a vote on a bill that has been awaiting passage for years. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentlewoman from Ohio will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, we have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Mr. KILDEE , and I am glad to say that he is not only here, but he has an excellent idea to break through this Republican obstruction and save lives. I am honored to yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ) for a very important unanimous consent request. Mr. KILDEE. I thank my friend for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the gentleman from Alabama how many more unanimous consent requests we need to make until the Republicans stop this obstruction and allow the bill to come forward. I am happy to yield for an answer. Mr. BYRNE. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Well, Mr. Speaker, you know, I think it is clear that we will not allow the Republicans to continue to obstruct these commonsense, bipartisan bills to prevent terrorists from assembling arsenals to kill our fellow Americans and to prevent convicted felons from legally acquiring firearms. We are joined by a leader from New York, and I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. CLARKE ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan—that means Democrats and Republicans—expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Jonathon Edwards, 22 years old, from Georgia. He was a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of action here in the House of Representatives. He is deserving of that action, Mr. Speaker. Twentytwo years. No action. Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to act. The American people need for us to act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentlewoman from New York will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for a very important unanimous consent request that will save lives. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, which would fall under the Committee on the Judiciary on which I serve as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, to honor the memory of Ronald McPhatter, a child of some mother and some father, and honor the memory of Ronald McPhatter, a victim of gun violence, who never received a moment of silence or action on this House floor. Ronald McPhatter needs justice. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentlewoman from Texas will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY ) for the purpose of a very important unanimous consent request that would save lives. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to the floor to honor the memory of David Washington. David Washington is a victim of gun violence. He can’t speak for himself anymore, and he never received a moment of silence or a moment of action on this House floor, but he deserves one. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentleman from New York will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WILSON ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request only that would save lives. Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Trayvon Martin from my district, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of 
silence on this House floor. And to all the mothers of murdered children in MiamiDade County and Broward County, I extend to them a moment of silence now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentlewoman from Florida will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for the purpose of a very important and timely unanimous consent request. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of the memory of Leatrick Benjamin, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor, let alone a moment of action. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ) for the purpose of a very important unanimous consent request. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of 14yearold Richard Newton from my district, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on this House floor, let alone a moment of action. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TORRES ), who has a very important and timely unanimous consent request. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Pomona Police Officer Shaun Diamond, murdered at the hands of a Mongol gang member. The silence has to stop. We need action. To honor his memory, I would like the House to take up this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentlewoman from California will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, and this is to honor the memory of Carl Batie, a former Mercer County corrections officer who was an innocent bystander killed in a hail of gunfire in a gangrelated fight in the city of Trenton in my district. I do this to honor Mr. Batie, who was that victim, and I do this because he never received a moment of silence and he has never received a moment of action on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentlewoman from New Jersey will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. b1400 Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the definition of obstruction in the dictionary is ‘‘a thing that impedes or prevents passage or progress; an obstacle or blockage.’’ The only obstruction here is the failure of the Republicans to simply remove that blockage or that thing that prevents passage of this commonsense measure to keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons and prevent terrorists from quietly assembling arsenals to conduct their terrorist acts. I hope that, now that my colleague from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) has joined us and he will be making a very important unanimous consent request in just moments, that will finally allow this body an opportunity to break through this obstruction, move to consideration of both bills under this rule, and move to consideration of the bipartisan bill that will prevent convicted felons from acquiring weapons. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of this brave soldier, Captain Antonio Davon Brown. I also want to honor the memory of people in my district who were victims of gun violence: Brandon Lawrence, New Rochelle, New York; Charles Smith, Mount Vernon, New York; Wilbert Francis, Mount Vernon, New York; Kevin Shaw, Mount Vernon, New York; Allashun Clay, Mount Vernon, New York. We want to honor their memories. They are all victims of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. We ought to be passing sensible gun control legislation in a bipartisan fashion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentleman from New York will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. DELBENE) for the purpose of a very important unanimous consent request. Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Amanda Alvear, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of action on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. MCDERMOTT ) for the purpose of an important and timely unanimous consent request. Mr. MCDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, bipartisan expanded background checks legislation. It is really to honor the memory of Paul Terrell Henry. He was a victim of gun violence in Orlando, who never received a moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BROWNLEY ), who has a request that will break through this Republican obstruction and save lives, for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Landon Dooley, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of action on this House floor. Enough is enough. Put this commonsense legislation forward today. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. RIBBLE ). As previously announced the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. 
Mr. POLIS. Point of parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. POLIS. It is a new Speaker pro tempore, and I was wondering if the new Speaker pro tempore would be willing to pose a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from Alabama. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has been informed that the gentleman from Alabama will not yield for the purpose of the gentleman’s request. Mr. POLIS. Very well. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGH TER) who has a very important unanimous consent request. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Elbert L. Merrick, III, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of action on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the gentleman from Alabama how many more unanimous consent requests we need to make until he agrees to allow for consideration of this bill. I am happy to yield for an answer. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. POLIS. Sadly, the gentleman from Alabama is unable to reserve or stop criminals from legally acquiring weapons or terrorists from silently assembling arsenals to conduct terrorist acts in our country. The only way the gentleman from Alabama can prevent those acts is to prevent the obstruction of this body by granting this very simple unanimous consent request that is about to be made by the gentleman from Florida. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Stanley Almodovar, III, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK ) for the purpose of a very important and timely unanimous consent request. Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation to honor the memory of Lori Dooley and Brooke Dooley, a mother and daughter, victims of gun violence who never received legislative action on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) for the purpose of an important unanimous consent request to save lives. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Eugene Liscomb, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence and never received a moment of action on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SERRANO ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Eric Ivan Ortiz Rivera, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence or who never received any action on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. TSONGAS ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Luis Vielma, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Brenda Lee Marquez McCool, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of action on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the gentleman from Alabama how many more requests we need to make until the Republicans stop their obstructionism and allow a simple vote on the bill. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER ) for the purpose of a very important unanimous consent request that would save lives. Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank my friend from Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Daniel Mauser. He is a young man who was a victim of gun violence at Columbine High School and was the son of a friend of mine, Tom Mauser. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, in a just breaking Politico article, it says that House leader infighting has forced GOP leaders to indefinitely postpone a vote on an antiterrorism package. You know, I don’t know who is going to tell the terrorists that we are postponing a vote on an antiterrorism package. I would hope that the Republicans would join us Democrats in trying to prevent terrorists from quietly assembling arsenals of explosives and guns and weapons to conduct coordinated attacks on the people of our country—that is what we are hoping to do—and break through this Republican obstructionism on this issue. Hopefully, there will be a new, breaking story based on the acceptance of a unanimous consent request that is forthcoming from my colleague from Ohio. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan KingThompson expanded backgrounds checks legislation, to honor the memory of Juan Ramon Guerrero, a victim of gun violence who never received either a moment of silence or a moment of action on this House floor. We ask Speaker RYAN to allow the vote. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, in honor of the memory of Darryl R. Burt, II, yet another Black man who lost his life to senseless violence. He never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentlewoman from California will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. 
Mr. POLIS. Point of parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. POLIS. The Chair has stated the last several times that the unanimous consent requests cannot be received. Is it that it cannot be accepted or that it is willfully not accepted by the gentleman from Alabama? The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time has been yielded for the purpose of debate. Mr. POLIS. Further parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. POLIS. When a unanimous consent request is made, is it not at the discretion of the gentleman controlling the time, the gentleman from Alabama, to agree to that request? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama has yielded time for debate only. Mr. POLIS. Further parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. POLIS. Can the gentleman from Alabama accept a unanimous consent request to yield for the purpose of a bill being brought forth? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama has not yielded for that purpose. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, point of parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. POLIS. Does the gentleman from Alabama have the ability to yield for that purpose? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama has control of the time on his side. Mr. POLIS. Reclaiming my time, again, the gentleman from Alabama can agree to these unanimous consent requests. The way that the answer has been framed, he has not agreed to them. The gentleman from Alabama and the Republicans are obstructing this body and preventing us from going about our business and getting to these bills, but it is certainly well within the authority under this rule for a unanimous consent request to be accepted. With that, I am actually glad to say we have a unanimous consent. I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. CAPPS ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. b1415 Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation called the expanded background checks bill, and I do so today in honor of a particular person who was a victim in the Orlando massacre. Her name is Mercedez Marisol Flores, a young woman who has never received her own moment of silence on this House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The time of the gentlewoman from California will be deducted from the gentleman from Colorado’s time. Mr. POLIS. Well, Mr. Speaker, they could be entertained, if the gentleman from Alabama would simply agree to them. We actually have a forthcoming unanimous consent request. I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that you are willing to pose it to the gentleman from Alabama to see if he would, in fact, agree to what I think is a very reasonable request, to bring forward a bipartisan bill. I am glad to yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ) for the purpose of just such a unanimous consent request. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank my colleague for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Edward Sotomayor, Jr., a victim of gun violence in Orlando at the Pulse Nightclub who never, ever has received a moment of action on this floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, would the Chair be willing to pose the question as to whether that unanimous consent request is accepted to the gentleman controlling the time? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman from Alabama will not yield for any such request. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, again, I know that the previous Speaker pro tempore had posed that question some time ago; but I was hoping, by this point, the gentleman from Alabama would have been moved to change his position. I am not going to ask every single time, but I would appreciate if the Chair would pose that question to the gentleman from Alabama about whether he would be willing to accept the most recent unanimous consent request of the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ) to save lives. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado may yield to the gentleman from Alabama for a response. Mr. POLIS. I would be happy to yield if the gentleman from Alabama would be willing to accept the unanimous consent request from Mrs. BONNIE WATSONCOLEMAN . Mr. BYRNE. All time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. I will take that as no. And, sadly, we are not about to run out of victims, Mr. Speaker. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the Democratic leader. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 1 minute. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background check legislation, to honor, once again, the memory of Carolyn Ann Sanders, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 1217, the bipartisan expanded background checks legislation, to honor the memory of Eddie Jamoldroy Justice, a victim of gun violence who never received a moment of silence on the House floor. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, so many of us have made unanimous consent requests. I have asked the gentleman from Alabama how many times we have to make this motion until the Republicans end their obstructionism. I have not received an adequate answer. I was hopeful that the gentleman from Alabama would have accepted this unanimous consent request by now. I was hopeful that the Chair would have posed a question to him multiple times, rather than accept his very first answer, now that the Democratic leaders and rankandfile Members have all come forward in support of bringing forward this bill and breaking through the Republican obstructionism. I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMP SON). Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we have been trying all day to convince the Republican leadership to bring up H.R. 1217. The reason being is that, for the last 3
1⁄2years, we have been trying to get a vote on this bipartisan, proSecond Amendment bill. And in the course of those 3
1⁄2 years, 34,000 people have been killed in our country by someone using a gun; 34,000. That is someone’s child, someone’s brother, someone’s loved one, someone’s wife, someone’s husband, someone’s partner; and it is absolutely shameful. Now we heard yesterday on the steps of the Capitol a terrifying story from a woman whose 10yearold daughter was murdered by someone with a gun, someone who couldn’t legally buy a gun because he couldn’t pass a background check. He was a felon. But he got around that law because he went online. He found the same gun that you could buy in a gun store online but without the requirement to pass a background check. He bought that gun. He shot that brave woman, and he murdered her daughter. We can take a step today to do something about that. We can bring up the background check bill. It is bipartisan, proSecond Amendment. It has 186 coauthors in this House. We can bring it up for a vote, and we can pass it. That will provide the first line of defense against people who shouldn’t be able to buy guns from buying guns. Who are these people? Criminals, domestic abusers, terrorists, those who are dangerously mentally ill. They should not be able to get their hands on a gun. Now, can we stop it in every instance? No. But we know that background checks work. We know that we can make a real difference. Every day, every day in the United States of America, 170 felons are stopped from buying guns because of the background check program. Every day in the United States of America, 50 domestic abusers are stopped from buying a gun because of the background check system. It works. We know it works. Why won’t we bring that bill up for a vote? That woman stood on the steps of the Capitol yesterday. That was a courageous stand she took. She lost her daughter. She watched her daughter be murdered right in front of her eyes. She, herself, was shot. But she is out advocating for sensible, proSecond Amendment, reasonable gun laws that will protect people. That is brave. What is brave about avoiding a vote on this bill, a bipartisan bill, a bill that 
supports the Second Amendment, a bill that has both Democrats and Republicans as coauthors: 186 coauthors, a background check bill, perfectly constitutional, perfectly reasonable, supported by gun owners, both Democrats and Republicans, supported by 90 percent of the American people. Ninety percent of the people that we collectively represent are asking us: Do something about this tragedy that is taking place over 30 times a day in the streets of America. Ninety percent. That is unbelievable support. And what has the Republican leadership done? Nothing. Thirtyfour thousand deaths in the last 3
1⁄2years that we have been trying to take up this bill; 1,182 mass shootings since we have tried to take up this bill; 30 moments of silence on the floor of this House; zero, zero votes to protect the people that we represent; zero votes to do anything regarding responsible, Second Amendment gun laws that will protect the people that we represent. Mr. Speaker, we are not asking for a lot. We are asking for a vote. We know that background checks work. Your side knows it, and our side know it. One of the previous speakers on the underlying bill today said: It is time to put politics aside and look at the policy. What in the world is going on with background checks? The policy is solid. They work. One hundred and seventy felons a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks. Fifty domestic abusers a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks. It sounds like pretty solid policy to me, Mr. Speaker. It must be the politics on the other side that are getting in the way. And the American people do not want that to continue. Ninety percent of the people who we represent are with us. They say that criminals, terrorists, domestic abusers, and the dangerously mentally ill should not be able to get guns and that the men and women who they send to the Congress of the United States of America should take responsible action to stop that from happening. Please, give us a vote on the background check bill. Help keep our constituents safe. Mr. POLIS. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. We are here on House Resolution 809. House Resolution 809 deals with two underlying bills. The first one is a conference report related to efforts to combat the opioid crisis that is wreaking havoc in communities across the United States. 46,000 people die—— Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a point of parliamentary procedure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Alabama yield for a parliamentary inquiry? Mr. BYRNE. I do not. Mr. THOMPSON of California. I am not asking the gentleman to yield. Mr. Speaker, I am asking you for a point of parliamentary procedure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is under recognition. The gentleman from California may not make a parliamentary inquiry unless yielded to for that purpose. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized. Mr. BYRNE. As I was saying, 46,000 people die every year of drug overdose. That is one of the things that is covered in the bills that are underlying in this resolution, and we just had over 2 hours of obstruction to try to keep us from considering that bill. The resolution also contains the effort to get us to a conference on the National Defense Authorization Act, which is the policy that defends the United States of America. If we want to keep terrorists from murdering people in the United States, we need to defeat them over there so that they don’t come over here. I would ask everybody in this House to get back focused on what this resolution is about: trying to save people who are tragically dying from drug overdose and protecting the people of the United States of America, the number one thing that we in this Congress are here to do. So I am glad that we are back to that because that is important business for this House. Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 809 and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. B YRNE . Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the further consideration of H.R. 5485, and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BYRNE ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 794 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 5485. Will the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. RIBBLE ) kindly take the chair. b1439 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 5485) making appropriations for financial services and general government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with Mr. RIBBLE (Acting Chair) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Thursday, July 7, 2016, a request for a recorded vote on amendment No. 25, printed in House Report 114–639, offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ) had been postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 26 OFFERED BY MR . DUFFY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 26 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
bureaucrats who make rules that have huge impacts on our families, on our businesses, and on our economy. I don’t know about you, but people come to me and say: There is a horrible rule. Could you help me out, my Member of Congress? What I do is I write a letter. We have disenfranchised the American people because we don’t make the laws anymore. We have outsourced that to the regulators. Let’s take that power back. When we empower the Congress, we empower the American people to have a say in their government on the rules that have a huge impact on their lives. Let’s have the backbone to take tough votes, to say ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ to these kind of rules. But let’s not outsource it to an agency that has no relationship with the American people and no accountability to the American people. This is saying ‘‘no.’’ Let’s take a stop and let’s reempower the Congress to have a say, which, again, empowers the American people. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, it is amazing. I think it could be December 31 of this year and we would still be trying to find a way to make the President look bad. That is what this is about. It is about this President having an administration. If it was up to some on the other side, there would be no Federal agencies, there would be no Federal employees, they might invent a new computer that would run the whole government, and the rest of us would just sit around. But be careful, because then somebody would suggest that there should not be a Congress. This should be left alone. We have agencies. We have secretaries. These agencies carry out. And when they don’t carry out to our understanding, believe me, just look at the appropriations bills. There are riders upon riders upon riders to try to undo what is being done, which, in many cases, is excellent work. This is just more of the same. It may come as a shock to you, but the President is still around for 6 more months and we are around for 6 more months and those administrators are around for 6 more months, so we better learn to get along for those 6 months. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ). The amendment was agreed to. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 794, I offer amendments en bloc. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendments en bloc.

AMENDMENT NO . 69 OFFERED BY MR . GRAYSON  
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 794, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CRENSHAW ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. SERRANO ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Chairman, the majority and the minority have agreed to these amendments en bloc. They are noncontroversial amendments that affect a variety of topics, such as whistleblower protection, property disposal, and reducing drug trafficking. Additionally, the sponsors of the amendments have agreed to the consideration of these amendments en bloc. I urge adoption of the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, this is going to be a historic moment, so let’s pay attention. I rise in support of the en bloc amendments. I appreciate the chairman’s inclusion of amendments for Democratic Members. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the en bloc amendment. I think it is a fine example of what we can do every so often. 
I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ). Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the ranking member. I rise to support a bipartisan amendment that I have offered with my colleague, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ), which helps communities combat the opioid and heroin epidemic by increasing funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program by $2 million. Across the country, HIDTA officials are doing important work to curb drug trafficking and bring law enforcement and community stakeholders together to stem the tide of drugs like heroin and fentanyl. Providing these additional resources will allow for even more local partnerships to fight drug trafficking. I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. I rise to offer my amendment to the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act to improve the FTC enforcement of the Do Not Call Registry list, and to improve public education about FTC–supported solutions that can block these malicious and annoying robocalls. Mr. Chair, all of us have suffered the repeated ringing from calls from unknown numbers from robocalls. It only takes one day sitting at home to realize how invasive robocalls have become. This is what our elderly and retired citizens have to deal with every single day. Robocall scammers steal over $350 million every year from those who fall prey to incessant calls. Without proper enforcement and support from the FTC, these calls will continue and all of our constituents will continue to suffer. This amendment I offer today would increase funding for the FTC for the purpose of additional enforcement of the Do Not Call Registry and for educating for consumers about their options. The relatively small increase in this amendment would result in 6.5 percent more funds for enforcement. Since 2004, the FTC has brought in $41 million in penalties. That’s a paltry $3.4 million each year. Considering scammers owe the FTC an estimated $1.2 billion in penalties, there’s a lot more that can be done. For the past several years, the FTC has held contests to support the development of robocall blocking apps such as Nomorobo and Robokiller. However, many people don’t know that they are free and are effective solutions for some consumers. By allowing the FTC to conduct more education and outreach, this amendment would further leverage existing FTC investment in this area. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. This amendment would provide a significant increase to the FTC’s ability to crack down on illegal robocalls and provide our constituents some peace for the constant robocall ringing. With that, I urge my colleagues to vote yes. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment which would transfer $7 million to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, also known as HIDTA. HIDTA coordinates federal, state, and local drug task forces to disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking operations. So many individuals—and by extension, their families and friends—are suffering the effects of drug abuse. The heroin and opioid epidemic is affecting all of northern Virginia. But currently, only part of my district is HIDTAdesignated. Two counties—Clarke and Frederick—have not yet received a HIDTA designation. But I will not rest until my constituents in the Shenandoah Valley are afforded the same resources to combat this scourge. The funding increase proposed by my amendment will ultimately save lives. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chair, those of us in this institution talk a lot about how America is a nation of laws. But unfortunately, a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that, while we are a nation of laws, we are not a nation of rules. At least not if you are a Federal worker. My amendment would prohibit the use of funds made available in the underlying bill with respect to Rainey v. Merit System Protection Board. Allow me to explain the case and why it’s relevant to the bill before us today. Dr. Timothy Rainey is a State Department employee who, while serving as a contracting officer in 2013, was ordered by his supervisor to violate the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Dr. Rainey refused, and in doing so he was removed from his duties. When Dr. Rainey invoked the ‘‘right–to–disobey’’ provision of the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Merit Systems Protection Board ruled that the law only protects him from refusing to violate Federal laws, but not rules or regulations. On June 7th, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld this ruling. So what does this mean, Mr. Speaker? I chair the Financial Services Oversight Subcommittee where we frequently get valuable tips from Federal whistleblowers about questionable and illegal activities at Federal agencies. This ruling will have the effect of taking away their protections to stand up to bad actors in the Federal workforce. Let’s not forget that our rules and regulations are supposed to be derived from law. In effect, this ruling will give permission to political appointees and other supervisors in positions of authority to force Federal works to violate the rules and regulations that Congress, through law, directs the agencies to implement. At the Treasury Department, one of the many agencies funded by this bill, this would mean that Federal workers could be forced to violate sanctions against Russia for its violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Many of those sanctions are enforced through the Code of Federal Regulations pursuant to laws enacted by Congress. Ultimately, Congress will need to fix the Whistleblower Protection Act. I intend to work in a bipartisan fashion and with the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to fix the Whistleblower Protection Act to address this ruling. In the meantime, I ask adoption of my amendment to put the House on record that Federal workers should follows laws and rules and regulations. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank Chairman CRENSHAW and Ranking Member SERRANO for including my amendment into the en bloc amendment to H.R. 5485, the FY2017 Financial Services Appropriations Act. I offered this amendment to increase the funding provided to the Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) by $3,300,000. By sharing financial intelligence with law enforcement, private industry, and its foreign counterparts, FinCEN supports financial crime investigations throughout the world. Terrorists’ proven ability to move money through innovative means necessitates continued progress in this critical counterterrorism area. The $3,300,000 is needed to enhance FinCEN’s supervisory strategy of Money Services Businesses and to meet the growing demand for FinCEN’s expanded national security response efforts. The amendment would offset this necessary increase through corresponding decreases in the funding provided for the ‘‘Rental of Space’’ account within the General Services Administration. Through my work as Ranking Member of the Financial Services Committee’s Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing and the CoChair of the bipartisan Task Force on AntiTerrorism & Proliferation Financing, I witnessed the vital work that FinCEN engages in to safeguard our financial system from evolving money laundering and national security threats. By analyzing financial intelligence and sharing it with law enforcement, private industry, and its foreign counterparts, FinCEN supports financial crime investigations throughout the world. At this time, FinCEN needs additional funding to enhance its supervisory strategy of Money Services Businesses (MSBs) and to establish a specialized response team to focus on high priority threats. This is important because banks are increasingly derisking by exiting the MSB market due to the high risks associated with MSB customers. For example, this is making it nearly impossible for families, charities, and businesses to send remittances to people in Somalia. A specialized response team will encourage banks to more consistently service the financial needs of the MSB market that is seen as higher risk. In addition, FinCEN could use these additional funds to meet the growing demand for its expanded national security response efforts. FinCEN continues to support the broader Department of Treasury efforts by identifying sources of revenue for organizations such as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and their attempts to access the international financial system. However, without adequate funding FinCEN will be unable to meet the demand for expanded intelligence reporting and increased investigations into terrorism finance. As evidenced by recent support to the Paris and Belgium terrorists attack investigations, FinCEN’s expertise assisted in quickly identifying links between the two attacks. FinCEN 
published 51 reports related to the Paris attacks and 2 reports related to the Brussels attack Many of these reports were generated through engagement with financial institutions by FinCEN, which resulted in increased reports from U.S. financial institutions. Moreover, FinCEN’s financial intelligence has played an important role in identifying potential foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs). With today’s increasingly complex and rapidly evolving terrorist networks, we cannot risk our national security by not adequately funding this important Department. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CRENSHAW ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 28 OFFERED BY MR . GARRETT  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 28 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 794, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. GARRETT ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today on an amendment that would prohibit special interests from having their agendas advanced by Washington bureaucrats, and to refocus the Securities and Exchange Commission on its important threefold policy mission: to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and to facilitate capital formation. Strong and efficient communication between the boards and management of public companies and their shareholders is foundational to healthy capital markets and to maintaining the ability of companies to innovate and to create jobs for everyone. Fortunately, recent studies have shown that communication between the investors and the companies has actually improved over recent years, and shareholders are now increasingly able to effectuate change without all of the drastic measures, such as launching a proxy fight. In fact, according to a 2015 report from Ernst & Young, the number of companies disclosing engagement on government topics rose from a mere 6 percent of the S&P 500 companies all the way up to 50 percent in 2015. In many ways, this is a private market at work as investors demand that boards and management be more responsive to their request for how to improve the company and their longterm performance. A number of regulatory hurdles still need to be overcome to improve the U.S. proxy system, which remains one of the primary ways in which public companies communicate between the two. Back in 2010, the SEC put forth a number of ideas, the socalled ‘‘Proxy Plumbing’’ concept release, which explored various ways to improve the transparency, if you will, of corporate government systems here in the United States. Importantly, the Proxy Plumbing concept release also discussed at length the importance of getting retail investors more involved in the process. For a variety of reasons, retail investors have for years been disenfranchised by the current proxy system, and they rarely exercise the rights of shareholders to engage in improving the way that the companies work. Unfortunately, for nearly 6 years, the SEC has, and maybe not surprisingly, allowed this Proxy Plumbing concept release to languish and has chosen not to act on it, even on some of the most basic and noncontroversial parts of it. But then last year, out of the blue, SEC Chair Mary Jo White had directed the SEC staff to develop a rulemaking for what is known as ‘‘universal proxy ballots.’’ You ask: What are universal proxy ballots? Good question. Put simply, while they sound quite benign, actually, universal proxy ballots are a means for special interest groups to easily then nominate their preferred candidates to a company’s board, and that would fundamentally change things. It would fundamentally change the way in which public company directors are elected here in the U.S. This is an initiative that has been pushed for years by insiders and special interests. It has also been pushed by a number of activist pension funds, many of which have been horribly managed themselves and now find themselves with unfunded liabilities that threaten the retirement security of the public sector workers over which they were responsible. The adoption of the universal proxy rule would only increase the likelihood of high profile proxy fights at public companies, which would then serve to distract the employees and management of these companies from carrying out their core mission. More importantly, it would make the vast majority of public company shareholders, including the smaller retail investor, pay the price for the costs associated with these big fights. Finally, it is unfair to those investors who do not wish to carry the water for these special interests. Aside from these specific policy concerns, there are also issues of how the SEC has been prioritizing its finite resources. The SEC recently missed the rulemaking deadline for yet again another congressional mandate to simplify and modernize our current corporate disclosure regime. This is an initiative that has bipartisan support and would help boost confidence by making quarterly and annual reports more effective for the small investor by reducing some of the unnecessary and the not material disclosures within them. Unfortunately, once again, the SEC chose to ignore what Congress mandated and, instead, prioritized rulemakings over such things as that universal proxy I mentioned, which, again, would benefit simply a minority of insider special interests over the vast majority of public company shareholders. This rulemaking should be nowhere on the SEC’s agenda. My amendment would simply disallow the SEC from using its finite resources. I urge all of my colleagues’ support. Mr. CRENSHAW. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GARRETT. I yield to the gentleman from Florida. Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for bringing the amendment before us. This is a very good amendment. It keeps the SEC on track, it gets them focused on their core dual mission—investor protection and capital formation. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman said it more succinctly than I did in the last 4 minutes, and I thank him. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from New Jersey has expired. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, it is amazing to hear the other side protecting the right of the SEC to do its work when the budget and the bill show just the opposite. This amendment is yet another attack on the independence and efficacy of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It also represents an attack on shareholders. When special interests cannot win ballot questions put to their shareholders, they seek protection from Congress to change the rules of the game. Specifically, this amendment would prohibit the SEC from proposing, implementing, or enforcing any regulatory action on the issue of universal proxy ballots. These universal proxy ballots would let shareholders vote for whomever they wish to represent them on the corporate boards. This is a vital consideration in proxy contests since 
board seats and, in some cases, board control are at stake. It would also make for a fairer, less cumbersome voting process. Right now, there is a twotiered system governing shareholder elections. Shareholders in attendance at meetings, particularly in proxy contests, have the ability to receive a legal ballot that allows them to pick and choose among all of the candidates who are duly nominated. b1500 Shareholders who are not in attendance do not have that ability and, typically, can only choose from among nominees who appear on management’s or a dissident’s ballot, but not both. This limits shareholders’ choice. Many advocates and investors, including the Council of Institutional Investors, have written to the SEC and have asked them to address this issue. Indeed, the CII filed a rulemaking petition to this effect. Likewise, the SEC Investor Advisory Committee, which is the group of outside experts tasked with the responsibility under Dodd Frank to advise the SEC on issues of investor protection, called upon the SEC to take action on this issue. Corporate governance is only effective when boards are elected in a free and fair manner. The SEC should take steps to eliminate disenfranchisement in proxy contests in cases where shareholders have no ability to ‘‘split their ticket’’ and vote for a combination of shareholder and management nominees. This amendment would curtail the SEC’s existing authority in this regard, to the detriment of shareholders and corporate accountability. I urge opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. GARRETT ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 29 OFFERED BY MR . GARRETT  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 29 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
spark the worst financial crisis in the U.S. since the Great Depression. By May 2009, various programs of support from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury amounted to more than $180 billion in bailouts to the company. Other nonbank broker dealers, like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, were at the center of the creation of toxic assets, which were central to the crisis and necessitated the need for a Wall Street bailout. The Garrett amendment would stop our banking regulators from subjecting the next Lehman Brothers from heightened regulation. Hedge funds were also key intermediaries in the distribution and structuring of toxic assets. Again, the Garrett amendment would stop our banking regulators from providing the heightened regulation of their operations. The Garrett amendment is an attempt to roll back the critical rules of the road we have passed in the wake of the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression. Large financial institutions are fighting the SIFI designation because they know that being identified as one means being subjected to regulation that is above and beyond current requirements, including ‘‘living wills,’’ which will help regulators plan how to wind down the firms in an orderly fashion in the event they become insolvent. The heightened regulation also includes the ability for regulators to ‘‘stress test’’ the entity to see if it can withstand financial distress, demand more capital, or to demand more stringent reporting. Former FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, a Republican appointee, noted in congressional testimony after the passage of DoddFrank: ‘‘Many institutions are vigorously lobbying against such a designation,’’ and ‘‘being designated a SIFI will in no way confer a competitive advantage by anointing an institution as ‘too big to fail.’’’ The capacity to designate nonbanks as SIFIs is critical to the U.S. financial system for appropriate regulatory oversight. The designation process already has in place multiple procedural safeguards and opportunities for appeal via a lengthy process. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Garrett amendment as it does much more harm than we would think. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 1
AMENDMENT NO . 30 OFFERED BY MR . GOSAR  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 30 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 794, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer a commonsense amendment with the intent of prohibiting the use of funds in this act to pay a performance award to any senior executive employee within the IRS. Under the direction of Commissioner John Koskinen, IRS officials have led a coordinated effort to hide the truth about this IRS’ targeting of innocent Americans based on their political beliefs. Rather than cleaning up this rogue agency, Koskinen has doubled down on the agency’s lawlessness and political culture. On Koskinen’s watch, the IRS intentionally destroyed nearly 24,000 emails from Lois Lerner and failed to comply with a congressional subpoena. To make matters worse, Commissioner Koskinen made a series of false and misleading statements under oath to Congress at multiple committee hearings on this matter. Koskinen said in March of 2014 that the IRS had turned over all of Lerner’s emails and all requested information; yet the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration uncovered more than 1,000 emails that the IRS tried to hide. b1515 The recent transgressions perpetrated by this agency are not only disgraceful, they border on corrupt. The trust Americans once had has been utterly destroyed. In July 2013, Danny Werfel, Acting Commissioner of the IRS, sought to eliminate bonuses for union employees and senior executives within the agency, sending an email to employees which stated: ‘‘I do not believe there should be performance awards this year for IRS employees, managers, or executives.’’ Unfortunately, Koskinen chose to ignore Werfel’s attempts to restore trust within the agency. In February of 2014, Koskinen announced his decision to pay out bonuses to senior IRS bureaucrats in order to improve ‘‘employee morale.’’ In April 2014, the Treasury inspector general reported that more than 1,100 IRS employees with delinquent tax returns received bonuses of more than a million dollars. That same investigation found: ‘‘2,800 IRS employees facing disciplinary actions received more than $2.8 million in monetary bonuses.’’ The Office of Personnel Management reported that in fiscal year 2014 alone, 61.5 percent of all senior executives within the Treasury Department received performance awards. Lawlessness within this agency should not be rewarded. This amendment seeks to effectuate a policy of accountability and change the corrupt culture of this agency by prohibiting bonuses and performance awards for Senior Executives Service employees within the IRS. It is unconscionable that Lois Lerner and other dishonest senior officials 
within the IRS have received more than $100,000 in bonuses in recent years. Committing perjury, purposely disposing of hard drives and more than 2,400 emails in order to stymie an investigation, and providing an extremely poor level of service to taxpayers doesn’t warrant a bonus of even a penny, in my mind. Fiftyseven Democrats joined every single Republican in seeking to prevent senior bureaucrats within the IRS from collecting these lavish bonuses in the fiscal year 2015 by voting in favor of my amendment that passed the House with strong bipartisan support. The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste supports this amendment and FreedomWorks is key voting in favor of this amendment. Once the IRS can prove that it will hold rogue employees accountable for their ineptitude, I will cease my efforts to prohibit these awards. Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their continued work on the committee. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I am going to start backwards here. We are not going to call for a vote on this, and the reason for it is, when people read your amendment, they are going to realize someone didn’t write it correctly. It doesn’t speak to the IRS. It actually allows for this cut to be across the board on the whole bill, which should make our chairman not very happy, and I am interested in my chairman’s happiness. I rise to oppose the amendment. This amendment would prevent agencies under this bill from giving employees in the Senior Executive Service bonuses. This seems to be aimed at the IRS since the summary on the Rules Committee Web site emphasizes the IRS, but it would have the same effect across the board. No one is saying that poor performance should be rewarded, but this takes one class of employees and punishes all of them regardless of their individual merits. It will cause us to lose good employees, which is not what we need. I realize Members on the other side of the aisle are eager to get their kicks in against the IRS—they even put them in bills when they are not the only ones in the bill—but I argue that this amendment would have unintended consequences. Rather than somehow making the IRS or any other agency better, this is likely to make it worse. This amendment is going to simply ensure that we have less accomplished employees at the IRS and at other government agencies. It would have a negative effect on recruitment and retention of highly talented senior executives necessary to ensure tax administration and other agency duties. It may also conflict with statutory requirements for SES bonuses that are designed to award strong performance. I oppose the amendment. It is not well targeted or well thought out. I think we also should know that this is the one agency that has been reduced in its employee number by the largest in the last few years, so I really don’t understand what this is trying to accomplish. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, let me now ask the gentleman from New York a question. I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SERRANO ) to respond. If you disagree with my amendment and feel that it will have unintended consequences, name the agencies in the bill that you think should be allowed to dole out lavish bonuses to their senior executives. Mr. SERRANO. I think that if an— Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I am asking the gentleman: Name me an agency here that should not be doling out— Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, with all due respect, and I am not answering the gentleman’s question, my role is not to tell you what you should have put in the bill. Mr. GOSAR. Reclaiming my time, if the gentleman from New York can’t give an answer— Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I am telling the gentleman from Arizona what he didn’t write. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, I think most hardworking Americans would agree that the senior bureaucrats with the Customer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, and the Federal Communications Commission should not be receiving lavish bonuses when we are $19 trillion in the hole. As I mentioned at the outset, the intent of this amendment is to prohibit the use of funds in this act to pay a performance award to any senior executive employee within the IRS. When the staff realized the actual language in the amendment could be more far reaching than intended, we attempted to work with the committee to correct this occurrence. One thing that this House agrees on is that senior executives within IRS should not be collecting bonuses, and this amendment prohibits exactly that occurrence. I urge adoption of this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I will be brief. I don’t want to read into the gentleman from Arizona’s statement, sir, that you were trying to get the chairman not to notice that you were writing the amendment that he dislikes the most across the board—that we both dislike the most. I just think, you know, what you are talking about is something that, in many cases, has to be looked at. Also, in order to keep good employees, you have to find ways to reward them. This agency, through the hits it takes, has lost—the one you intend, according to your comments, the IRS— has lost 18,000 employees in a couple of years since 2010, I believe, 18,000 employees. Now we go further here. Secondly, I am glad to see that you spoke about other agencies, which means you must have read the amendment a little closer. But I still think it is not a good amendment. I still think it should be defeated. I yield back the balance of my time. ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR  
The Acting CHAIR. The Members on both sides are reminded to direct their remarks directly to the Chair and not to each other. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 31 OFFERED BY MR . GOSAR  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 31 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 794, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment. The GosarBridenstine DuncanGohmertHuelskampJones BarlettaBratBrooksBlack amendment prohibits funds within this act from being used in contravention of Federal immigration law for sanctuary city policies. The concept of sanctuary city policies is in direct opposition to the rule of law and our Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 4 gives Congress clear jurisdiction on immigration matters. A nation of laws must enforce established law, not seek ways to skirt around it. Sanctuary cities defy Federal immigration statutes by harboring untold numbers of illegal immigrants and providing safe havens for criminals, many of whom are violent offenders. Our amendment prohibits the use of funds which are appropriated by this act from being used in contravention of 
AMENDMENT NO . 32 OFFERED BY MR . GUINTA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 32 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 794, the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. GUINTA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Hampshire. Mr. GUINTA. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, in March of 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued flawed and inaccurate guidance that would threaten to eliminate auto dealers’ flexibility to discount the interest rate offered to consumers financing vehicle purchases. Whether a person seeks to buy an automobile, an RV, or a motorcycle, consumers rely heavily on their neighborhood auto dealer to provide them the best possible rate. However, this faulty and unstudied guidance could increase the cost for consumers, ultimately making it more difficult to obtain an automobile. Roughly 6 months ago, my good friend across the aisle, Mr. PERLMUTTER , and I, introduced H.R. 1737, which passed the House with an overwhelming bipartisan and vetoproof vote, 332–96. My bill, along with 13 bipartisan letters sent by Congress over 
the last 3 years, gave the CFPB a chance to fix the faulty guidance and reissue it, but, unfortunately, they still insist on an anticonsumer policy and chose to keep their faulty bulletin in place. In fact, the CFPB has refused to change course even with a solution modeled on the Department of Justice consent order that is supported by auto dealers and lenders and do not resort to eliminating dealer discounts. Congress has given the CFPB an opportunity to correct and reissue their guidance, and that would take into account consumers and bring clarity to the market. Mr. Chairman, my amendment will leave no doubt that either the CFPB will fix this problem they created or Congress will, and if we do it, we will do it in a bipartisan way. I would like to thank Chairman CRENSHAW and Chairman H ENSARLING  of the Committee on Financial Services for their support. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CRENSHAW ). Mr. CRENSHAW. I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for bringing this before the body. Here is another example of the CFPB overregulating, trying to find a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. I support this amendment, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SERRANO. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the CFPB from implementing, administering, or enforcing any guidance related to indirect auto lending. This is meant as a shot across the bow to the CFPB, telling them not to bring fair lending cases against indirect automobile finance companies. But on a practical level, the amendment will only invite confusion into the industry. After all, this amendment does nothing to address lenders’ obligations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Instead, the amendment only strikes guidance the CFPB has provided to those lenders, providing clarity on how they can meet their obligations under the law. Discrimination in any finance market is unacceptable, and we know that discrimination is still alive and well in the indirect auto lending marketplace. In the three settlements to date against Ally Financial, Fifth Third Bank, Honda and Toyota Motor Credit, the CFPB secured nearly $162 million in borrower relief and penalties, finding that minority borrowers paid more than $200 over the life of a car loan than White borrowers, even when controlling for borrowers’ creditworthiness. Discretionary markups are the source of discrimination in auto lending, and the guidance that this amendment nullifies helps lenders monitor and respond to potentially discriminatory auto lending practices. It is something that we should not be allowing, and this amendment tries to undo a lot of work that we are doing and a lot of work that should be done in the future. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman that there is no place for discrimination. Based on information from the CFPB, CBO expects that the agency would not prepare a replacement bulletin if H.R. 1737 were enacted. That is because the bill would not affect the underlying statute or regulations to implement it. The Bureau can continue to enforce the Equal Credit Opportunity Act without the bulletin. I also remind the gentleman that the minority report also stated that this would not negatively impact the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ). Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I thank Mr. SERRANO for yielding. You just described this as a shot across the bow to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and you are absolutely right. They are attempting to tell them not to bring fair lending cases against indirect automobile finance companies. This amendment is about protecting wrongdoers who gouge racial and ethnic minorities with high markups on car loans even when their income, their credit scores, and their financial backgrounds are the same as Whites. The amendment is about protecting companies like Ally Financial, Fifth Third Bank, Honda and Toyota Motor Credit, all of whom have had to enter into settlements with the Bureau over their indirect auto loan practices. All told, the CFPB, again, has secured nearly $162 million in borrower relief and penalties to help these borrowers. In their investigations, the Bureau found that minority borrowers paid more than $200 over the life of a car loan than White borrowers, even when controlling for borrowers’ creditworthiness. Studies have shown that minority borrowers are less likely to be aware of interest rate markups. According to the Center for Responsible Lending, 68 percent of all borrowers were unaware that dealers have the ability to mark up an interest rate above what a lender offers based on their creditworthiness and the car being sold, but nearly 75 percent of African American and Hispanic borrowers are unaware that the practice of dealer markups even exists. The guidance that this amendment seeks to nullify clearly outlines steps that lenders can take to protect borrowers from potentially discriminatory lending practices that often occur without the borrower even being aware of it occurring. So we know what the intent of this amendment is, but on a practical level, the amendment will only invite confusion into the industry. After all, this amendment does nothing to address lenders’ obligations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Instead, the amendment only strikes guidance the CFPB has provided to those lenders providing clarity on how they can meet their obligations under the law. The issue has come up before in this Congress, but no matter where you stood on H.R. 1737, a bill we considered last year, you should be against this amendment. To the Members on the opposite side of the aisle, you are supposed to have a poverty agenda, and you claim that you are taking on a new direction, that you want to have reduced poverty and deal with the problems of minorities and people in rural communities, et cetera. This is what keeps poverty in these communities. We have these blue suede, slick dealers of all kinds— whether they are automobile lenders or payday loans or auto loans, all of this stuff—coming into these communities, taking advantage of the most vulnerable people who want to get out of poverty. You say you want to help, but then you come in and you attack the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You want to do everything to undermine their authority. 
The Acting CHAIR. Members on both sides are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair and not each other. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, the Bureau’s guidance was issued without public notice or comment and without any study of its impact on consumers or small businesses. I want to thank the ranking member for authoring the minority report that states: ‘‘H.R. 1737 does not alter regulated entities’ obligations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the CFPB’s examination or enforcement activity pursuant to ECOA.’’ This is nothing more than a continuation of H.R. 1737. I also want to repeat my thanks to my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mr. PERLMUTTER , for helping me with a successful 332–96 vote in favor of that bill. This amendment is almost identical to it, and I would appreciate the ongoing support on behalf of consumers not just in New Hampshire, but all across the country. Mr. Chairman, I would again thank the chair, Mr. CRENSHAW , as well as Mr. HENSARLING , those Members who voted in favor, 332–96, on H.R. 1737. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. GUINTA ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Hampshire will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 33 OFFERED BY MR . HUDSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 33 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 794, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support my amendment that prohibits future regulations from the Obama administration. This is a commonsense step to rein in our regulatory system and make it work for the American people and not the other way around. Since my first days in office, one message I continue to hear is people are tired of an unaccountable government that oversteps its bounds. In April, I was successful in pushing the EPA to withdraw a harmful regulation that would have devastated the motorsports industry. I recently had the opportunity to visit a national leader in custom autoracing parts in my hometown of Concord, North Carolina. I spoke with one worker who told me that if this one regulation would have gone through, he would have lost his entire livelihood. That, Mr. Chairman, is unacceptable. The problem is, agencies have moved beyond their constitutional authority, and Washington bureaucrats are accountable to no one. They show little regard for the real world damage of their new rules on working families, on people looking for jobs, on our economy in general. From regulatory gut punches like ObamaCare and everexpanding EPA rules, stacking one on top of the other often before the previous rule is even enacted, regulations under this President have woven a web so complex and large, it risks ensnaring every American. This means fewer job opportunities, it means lower wages, and more families struggling. At its core, overregulation is a form of stealth taxation. Working families, working people are paying the price for every new rule that comes out of Washington. Now, I recognize some regulations are necessary, but we need a regulatory system that is transparent, one that balances the needs of our environment and public safety with economic strength and jobs, one that benefits hardworking Americans, not big government, big labor, and big business. It is time for us to chart a new pro growth course away from this administration’s burdensome regulations so that Americans can get back to work, and this amendment is one solution. b1545 It will prevent the President from unleashing a new hailstorm of regulations in an attempt to cement his legacy in the last months of his administration. I encourage my colleagues to support it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting that there is a new bipartisanship here. I notice that this bill takes effect from now until January 21. So that means we will wait for Mrs. Clinton to become President before any new regulation would take effect. Secondly, the other side is always complaining about regulations. But every so often, we should step back and, instead of knocking our country so much, kind of pay attention to what some of those regulations have done. Sure, we have regulations. We have regulations about conditions in coal mines. Is that bad? We have regulations about the water we drink. Is that bad? We have regulations about the air we breathe. Those regulations make us different from other countries where there is no respect for the population and no protection. There is a regulation that says you have to go to school up to a certain age. That is great. There is a regulation that says no children can be working in factories or in the garment industry in New York. That is wonderful. So I am not afraid of regulations. Overregulating, okay, we can discuss that. But that side wants no regulation. It wants a computer to run the country. I keep claiming I want to see who is going to invent that computer. Here we go again, just talking about overregulating. There are questions. This provision, for instance, would also be in direct conflict with other statutory requirements. For example, EPA is required to finalize annual renewal fuel standards regulations by November 30 of each year. I am sure there are others. This is widely overbroad and can prevent significant regulatory actions in emergency situations, like disaster relief, where required by a court order, or when required by statute. For another example, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau, or TTB, in Treasury would not be able to publish implementing regulations relating to taxation of cider and removal of bond requirements for small beverage alcohol producers, and numerous other rules, such as a final rule reducing formula burdens on industry for specially denatured spirits and completely denatured alcohol, and the modernization of beverage alcohol. It is easy to say: no more regulations from October 1 to January 21. Let the next President deal with it. You are rolling the dice, assuming you think you know who is going to be President. But that is okay, I can roll along with you. The problem is that this is not the way to go. The dislike of the Obama administration by the other side is so evident, especially in amendments like this, where it is directed. At least, to your credit, you had the honesty in you to say the Obama administration. You called it by name, and I respect for you that. Other than that, I don’t have a lot of respect for your amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from North Carolina has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. HUDSON. I thank my colleague for his comments. I do agree that we don’t need to eliminate all regulations. That is certainly not what we are saying here. We are saying that, from October 1 until January 21, we don’t need new regulations. With all due respect, I think we have had plenty. The amount of regulations that have come out of the Obama administration has been astounding. If you compare the amount of regulations to all other administrations combined, it is astounding, and they affect every aspect of people’s lives. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman mentioned regulations in the past have been good. For example, regulating coal mines. I am sure that there were good regulations on coal mines, but we are at the point now where this administration is going to make coal mines illegal. The gentleman also mentioned, Mr. Chairman, regulating water and air. We certainly all agree that we want clean air and clean water. But this administration issues a clean air regulation, or a new rule, and even before it goes into effect, they issue the next one to reduce the levels even lower—to levels that even experts agree aren’t necessary. In fact, members of the other party, in our hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee, testified to the fact that the air today is so much cleaner 
than it was before. And science proves that. In North Carolina, we have got a 20 percent reduction in the coarse particulate matter in our air. We have made great progress, but to say we are going to continue to lower that level even before the science is to determine what the effect of the last regulation was is simply going too far. What that means is, in places like Montgomery County, North Carolina, where we desperately need jobs, you can’t have a new job. You can’t have a new road. You can’t have a new water sewer line. You have can’t add any new manufacturing jobs. That is ridiculous. This administration has had 7
1⁄2 years, and they have used that time wisely if their goal was to overregulate the American people. All I am saying is, in the last few months of this administration, let’s put the brakes on. As my colleague mentioned, we don’t know who the next President is going to be. It may be someone from the other party. But that new President will have won a mandate, and that new President can then address the regulatory scheme. I look forward to having that debate. But as far as this administration, the votes are in. We have gotten our results. This administration has gone way too far with regulation. So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to put on the brakes and say: 7
1⁄2years; enough is enough. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, you know, it is amazing. Many of us—and I am not suggesting you—get elected to Congress, and we are in awe of the fact that we come from where we come when we get to Congress. I am in that category. I am very blessed. There are others who come to Congress, and it seems that they come to Congress to undo Congress and undo the government. We are the greatest nation on Earth. How did we get that? Obviously, the fighting and the working spirit of the American people. But it was also the protections placed on the American people; the fact that children were told you have to go to school, the fact that we try to get the best water. We spoke before about an immigration issue. I don’t call it a problem. Why does it exist? Because people still know that we are the greatest country on Earth, and they want to come here. So a lot of what you see as government intrusion, a lot of what you see as government being a pain could actually be some of the reasons that we became the great country we are. We just didn’t let people go on their own and hurt each other, and so on. We had people elected by the people to say: Hey, hold on. Why don’t we do this? Why don’t we do that? Why don’t we curtail this? Why don’t we grow that? And we continue to do that. So we disagree. I think we are great because we have certain rules to follow. And we follow them well. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 34 OFFERED BY MR . HUIZENGA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 34 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 794, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Section 1502 of the DoddFrank Act requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue a rule mandating that public companies disclose whether the minerals they use benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo, also known as the DRC, and its nine neighboring countries. ‘‘Conflict materials’’ refer to tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, which have been used in a huge variety of products, from cell phones, cosmetics, jewelry, chemicals, footwear, and including auto parts made right in west Michigan. Simply put, section 1502 produced a rule that has failed everyone, and my amendment would, therefore, suspend its implementation for 1 year. The people of central Africa don’t want it. President Obama’s own SEC chair doesn’t want it. Parts of the rule have been judged by the courts to violate First Amendment rights, and businesses throughout America are burdened with a reporting task that even the Department of Commerce has admitted is impossible. Recently, the European Union—apparently sobered by other own experience in the U.S.—rejected this approach to conflict minerals. It is easy to see why they did so. As we debate this amendment, let’s be clear on what this isn’t about. It is not about who cares more about the plight of the Congolese more, a population that continues to suffer violence at the hands of rebel groups. The question is whether a window dressing disclosure rule at the SEC is the way to address this problem. If we truly care about peace in central Africa, then good intentions aren’t enough. We have to demand results, Mr. Chairman. Sadly, we have gotten the wrong kind of results from section 1502. Recently, I spoke with some missionaries from my own denomination who confirmed this. However, let’s start by highlighting the voices of those who too often go unheard in this debate— the voices of the Africans themselves. I include in the RECORD an open letter from 70 Congolese leaders and other regional experts who wrote: ‘‘But in demanding that companies prove the origin of minerals sourced in the eastern DRC or neighbouring countries before systems able to provide such proof have been put in place, conflict mineral activists and resultant legislation—in particular Section 1502 of the DoddFrank Act—inadvertently incentivize buyers on the international market to pull out of the region altogether and source their minerals elsewhere. ‘‘As a result, the conflict minerals movement has yet to lead to meaningful improvement on the ground, and has a number of unintended and damaging consequences.’’ According to a Washington Post article titled ‘‘How a wellintentioned U.S. law left Congolese miners jobless,’’ section 1502 ‘‘set off a chain of events that has propelled millions of miners and their families deeper into poverty,’’ with many miners forced to find other ways to survive, including by joining armed groups. This article goes on to share the story of a Congolese teenager who actually joined a militia because mining could no longer put food on his table. ‘‘If we were earning money more from mining, I would not have entered the militia,’’ he said. I ask my colleagues to remember the Congolese, who aren’t alone in their suffering. The SEC rule applies to nine other African nations as if they were all a single country. Section 1502 treats over 230 million people living in 10 distinct nations as one undifferentiated group. Little wonder that Africans themselves take issue with Washington’s onesizefitsall mentality. In testimony to the Financial Services Committee last November, Rwanda’s Minister of State for Mining, Evode Imena, noted that—despite Rwanda’s actions to strengthen due diligence in its mining sector, and despite the fact that Rwanda has no armed groups in the first place—‘‘the region is now suffering from an ‘Africafree’ and not a ‘conflictfree’ minerals situation. Section 1502 has caused a de facto boycott by companies in the U.S. and much of Europe on most of our valuable resources.’’ This disaster ‘‘has largely 
impacted the livelihood of thousands of miners and their families . . .’’ The words of Africans harmed by this rule should be enough for us to suspend it. But if we need more evidence of section 1502’s failures, let’s take a look at hard numbers. A GAO study found last year that not a single company sampled could determine whether its minerals supported armed groups. Professor Jeff Schwartz of the University of Utah Law School has come to a similar conclusion, after reviewing 1,300 filings under section 1502. Additionally, I wrote to SEC Chair White asking for a detailed description of the funds and hours expended to date on the SEC conflict minerals disclosure rule. In the SEC response letter, she stated that from July 2010 to March 16, 2015, the SEC spent over 21,000 hours and approximately $2.7 million on this particular provision which the SEC has little to no experience with. Given the lack of benefits from this rule, it is no wonder SEC Chair Mary Jo White has said: ‘‘Seeking to improve safety in mines for workers or to end horrible human rights atrocities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are compelling objectives, which, as a citizen, I wholeheartedly share. But, as the Chair of the SEC, I must question, as a policy matter, using the federal securities laws and the SEC’s powers of mandatory disclosure to accomplish these goals.’’ I agree with the SEC, and I appreciate support for this amendment. 
ANOPENLETTER  Dear governments, companies, nongovernmental organisations, and other stakeholders implicated in efforts of various kinds related to the issue of ‘conflict minerals’: In early 2014, two international industry giants—Intel and Apple—issued refined corporate social responsibility policies for minerals sourced in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The announcements followed an unprecedented wave of guidelines, lawmaking, and initiatives over the past few years to ‘clean up’ the eastern DRC’s mining sector, and were met with widespread praise. Perhaps the most widely publicised of these efforts is US legislation known as Section 1502 of the DoddFrank Act, which asks all companies registered on the US stock market to reveal their supply chains to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when sourcing minerals from the eastern DRC or neighbouring countries. Canada is in the advanced stages of developing similar legislation, and many other countries are looking closely at the issue. The European Union has introduced a voluntary conflict minerals regulation scheme for all member states, and the United Nations (UN) and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have developed guidelines on sourcing natural resources in high risk areas such as the eastern DRC. These efforts primarily target artisanal (or ‘informal’) mining in the eastern DRC, due to widespread international recognition that socalled conflict minerals (most notably tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) produced by artisanal mining in this part of the world have helped conflict actors generate revenue to finance their operations in the DRC over the past two decades. THE SITUATION  Despite successes of activists in shaping policy, the conflict minerals campaign fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between minerals and conflict in the eastern DRC. First, while the minerals help perpetuate the conflict, they are not its cause. National and regional political struggles over power and influence as well as issues such as access to land and questions of citizenship and identity are just some of the more structural drivers of conflict. The ability to exploit and profit from minerals is often a means to finance military operations to address these issues, rather than an end in itself. Internal UN assessments, for instance, show that only 8% of the DRC’s conflicts are linked to minerals, and specific motivations vary greatly across the vast array of different armed groups. Second, armed groups are not dependent on mineral revenue for their existence. The eastern DRC is a fully militarised economy, in which minerals are just one resource among many that armed groups—and the national army FARDC—can levy financing from. The M23, until recently the most powerful nonstate armed group in DRC, never sought physical control over mining activity. Moreover, few local stakeholders have been included in ongoing international policy making, and as a result realities on the ground have not always been taken into account. Setting up the required systems and procedures to regularly access and audit thousands of artisanal mining sites in isolated and hardtoreach locations spread across an area almost twice the size of France would be a challenge for any government. In the eastern DRC, where road infrastructure is poor to nonexistent and state capacity desperately low, the enormity of the task is hard to overstate. But in demanding that companies prove the origin of minerals sourced in the eastern DRC or neighbouring countries before systems able to provide such proof have been put in place, conflict minerals activists and resultant legislation—in particular Section 1502 of the DoddFrank Act—inadvertently incentivize buyers on the international market to pull out of the region altogether and source their minerals elsewhere. 
THE RESULT  As a result, the conflict minerals movement has yet to lead to meaningful improvement on the ground, and has had a number of unintended and damaging consequences. Nearly four years after the passing of the DoddFrank Act, only a small fraction of the hundreds of mining sites in the eastern DRC have been reached by traceability or certification efforts. The rest remain beyond the pale, forced into either illegality or collapse as certain international buyers have responded to the legislation by going ‘Congo free’. This in turn has driven many miners into the margins of legality (for instance, feeding into smuggling rackets), where armed actors return through the loopholes of transnational regulation. Others have simply lost their jobs, and in areas where mining has ceased, local economies have suffered. To put this in context, an estimated eight to ten million people across the country are dependent on artisanal mining for their livelihood. Some former miners have returned to subsistence agriculture, but persisting insecurity levels leave them in abject poverty facing dire living conditions, in fear of missing harvests due to displacement. Others have been prompted to join militias as a means to quick cash in the absence of other opportunities; a particularly perverse impact, when one considers the intentions of the movement. Alongside the impact on mining communities and local economies, several armed groups have responded by turning to different businesses such as trading in charcoal, marijuana, palm oil, soap, or consumer goods. Those remaining in the mining sector have largely traded mineral exploitation on site for mineral taxation a few steps down the supply chain, operating numerous roadblocks that can bring in millions of dollars a year. Others are reported to have sent in family members or civilian allies to run business for them on site, while they remain safely at a distance. For the few mining sites fortunate enough to be reached by Joint Assessment Teams responsible for determining their ‘conflictfree’ status, these teams have been unable to provide the regular, threemonth validation visits envisaged in legislation. There is an additional delay of several months following these visits before the Congolese Ministry of Mines reviews and approves the assessment at the national level. Given the speed at which situations can change in volatile environments, infrequent assessments and lengthy delays raise concerns over the accuracy of certification and the credibility of the system. More worrying still, multinational corporations such as Apple and Intel are auditing smelters to determine the conflictfree status of the minerals they source, and not the mines themselves. As smelters are located outside of the DRC and audits are not always conducted by third parties, these processes raise further concerns over whether conflictfree certifications reflect production realities. By far the most advanced site in terms of producing ‘conflictfree’ minerals for sale to the international market is Kalimbi, a tin mining area home to externallyfinanced initiatives running an industryled bagging andtagging scheme called iTSCi. Yet even here, despite the establishment of a ‘closed pipeline’ from mine to exportation, the mine still suffers from the sporadic influence of armed actors, and miners are made to bear the additional costs of ‘conflictfree’ schemes. This raises further concerns over the credibility of the system in place, and its suitability for the scaleup and expansion to other, more remote mine sites currently underway. Coupled with slow progress in implementation, the trend towards the monopolisation of ‘conflictfree’ supply chain initiatives, in particular traceability by iTSCi, is economically damaging to local populations since it currently excludes and isolates the overwhelming majority of mining communities from legal access to international markets. 
THE ALTERNATIVE  There is broad consensus for the need to clean up the eastern Congo’s minerals sector, yet much disagreement about the international community’s current model for achieving this goal. As such, efforts to improve transparency in the eastern DRC’s mineral supply chains should continue. Yet a more nuanced and holistic approach that takes into account the realities of the eastern DRC’s mining sector and the complexity of the conflict is needed. To this end, we make the following five recommendations: Improve consultation with government and communities: Congolese government and civil society were poorly consulted on Section 1502 of the DoddFrank Act prior to its passing, and as a result many were unaware of its implications. The few who were consulted were unanimously proDoddFrank, creating additional conflicts on local levels where endorsement and dissent compete. More Congolese voices must be listened to, and the local context and power structures 
taken into account. This would ensure greater understanding of the local context and better harmonisation with existing national and regional initiatives, such as the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region’s (ICGLR) Regional Initiative against the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources. Work towards meaningful reform: The audit process should be designed to improve policies and practices rather than to just provide windowdressing. The dominant belief that static oversight and validation processes ensure ‘conflictfree’ mineral trade is misplaced given the volatile security situation in most of the eastern DRC. Both mines and smelters should be regularly inspected and the time period between inspection and certification minimized. Where this is not feasible, additional waivers or similar measures should not be ruled out. Create incentives towards better practice: Legal frameworks must be supported by real projects on the ground that can meet their requirements. If this is not possible—which is clearly still the case today, nearly four years after the passing of DoddFrank—then transition periods must be extended and the lowering of excessively high standards for ‘conflictfree’ minerals should be considered. Similarly, former conflict actors should be incentivised where appropriate to join new ‘conflictfree’ schemes. This may help avoid the eventual subversion or infiltration of the ‘clean’ system put in place, as has been seen to date. Promote fair competition: Regulation must be based on competition that allows not only international businesses but also Congolese producers to influence (i.e. increase) local price schemes. This in turn would encourage a regime that ensures minimum wages which mining cooperatives can guarantee to their members based on their increased leverage on the price fluctuation. Widen the lens: Root causes of conflict such as land, identity, and political contest in the context of a militarized economy, rather than a single focus on minerals, must be considered by advocates seeking to reduce conflict violence. Furthermore, efforts to eradicate conflict minerals should not overlook the fact that artisanal mining is a key livelihood in the eastern DRC that holds as much potential to help steer the region away from conflict as it does to contribute towards it. More supportive measures are needed—such as those found in the earlier 2009 draft of the US Conflict Minerals Act—that can help capture the economic potential of artisanal mining. Finally, other critical challenges such as access to credit, technical knowledge, hazardous working conditions, and environmental degradation should not be ignored by multinational corporations if they seek to improve business practices and increase transparency in their supply chains. So far, progress has been made in producing more ethical products for consumers, but stakeholders have not yet proceeded to improve the lives of Congolese people, nor address the negative impact current ‘conflictfree’ initiatives are having. If the conflict minerals agenda is to lead to positive change on the ground, legislation passed by national governments and steps such as those outlined by Apple or Intel need to be grounded in a more holistic approach that is better tailored to local realities. Failure to do so will continue to seriously limit the ability of conflict minerals initiatives to improve the daily lives of the eastern Congolese and their neighbours. Worse, these initiatives will risk contributing to, rather than alleviating, the very conflicts they set out to address.

Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. b1600 Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. MCDERMOTT ). Mr. MCDERMOTT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is just another devious Republican attempt to undermine efforts to end the decadelong scourge of rape and murder in Congo. I have been in Congo many times. I served in the State Department in Kinshasa. I know the area. And the gentleman’s statement that there is no company that is able to do this is absolutely incorrect. There is a company in Coral Gables, Florida, Kemet Corporation. They certify every bit of their metal is conflictfree. It is possible to do. Now, why is this important? Well, all the 5 million people that have died in eastern Congo since Rwanda in 1992–93 have been from armed militias that are getting their money by taking minerals out of the ground and selling them abroad using slave labor. The way you enslave a man is to rape his wife in front of him, and then bring him down and chain him and make him dig up the minerals. That is what has been going on there, and it has been going on for a long time, and everyone in this room is benefiting from that. Everybody who has a cell phone has tin, tungsten, tantalum in it. And what this amendment is about is companies that will not go through the process. They do not want to do it. They want to get it from wherever it comes from. They don’t care who it is. Now, you can’t tell me, and I know enough about Boeing and a lot of other companies, that they know their supply chain right down to where it starts in the ground somewhere. Everything that is in a plane, they know where it came from. And for them to say they don’t know where it comes from or I can’t know is simply that they want to get it on the cheap and don’t care about human value in central Africa. Now, the gentleman has given me the opening, which I didn’t know if I would have, but his own church, the Christian Reformed Church in North America, their coordinator of office of social justice says defunding section 1502 and amendment No. 34 is immoral. It will result in violations and will undo work to our conflictfree mining in Africa. This is a longtime battle, and we have had no one come up with any other way to deal with this except to cut off the money to the militias. To say there is not armed conflict in eastern Congo is somebody who has got their head buried in the sand; because if you go over there, you know that there is conflict from Rwanda and Uganda and all the countries in that area, because this stuff is valuable and people want it, and they want it on the cheap. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MCDERMOTT. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I maybe, possibly like yourself, have occasional differences with my own church denomination. I have challenged them to talk to their own missionaries that are in the surrounding areas, whom I have talked to, who are also out on the coast, who are now seeing minerals exported. Mr. MCDERMOTT. Reclaiming my time, I get your point. You are saying that your church in wherever they are located, in Michigan or wherever, they are out of touch with what is going on on the ground. I am in touch with the people on the ground. There are groups like HEAL Africa, which have been operating a hospital in Goma, which has been filled with people that come from this whole process. And when you go over there and talk to them, they say the only way you are ever going to do it here is cut off the money, and that means saying to people you have got to know where that tin or tungsten or tantalum came from and was it gotten by using slave labor. If you are unwilling to do that, as a company, in the United States, you have no moral fiber. If you are not willing to say you will not use slave labor for the material that is in your product, in your cell phone—and believe me, it wouldn’t be hard to get a boycott going in this country against some folks who want to, but nobody wants to come out in the open. This amendment gets slid in at the last minute every year. Senator DURBIN, Senator C OONS , Barney Frank, all of us worked on this. We have heard it all. And of course the SEC doesn’t want to do it. They don’t want to do anything that doesn’t have to do with paper shuffling and letting the derivatives run through the economy. They simply have been given this because they handle the money. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. FARENTHOLD ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 35 OFFERED BY MR . HUIZENGA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 35 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
should know—especially in the cases of stockholders too, there are a lot of stockholders who are small stockholders—and they want to know what company they are investing in. So I think that this rule or this approach is good, and I think your amendment just tries to—I am not saying you do—but your amendment, the final result will be to try to cover up the truth, and that is not a good thing. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan will be postponed. The Chair understands that Amendment No. 36 will not be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO . 37 OFFERED BY MR . LANCE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider Amendment No. 37 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 794, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to eliminate the potential of Iran’s gaining access to the U.S. dollar. As Iran continues to violate international law with illicit ballistic missile tests, as it undermines U.S. foreign policy, and as it destabilizes the Middle East, the Obama administration may be willing to ease restrictions on Iran’s access to the dollar and potentially reward Iran’s international provocations with coveted access to world financial markets. We cannot allow this to happen. Since agreeing to the Iranian deal last year, the Obama administration has seemingly gone out of its way to appease Iran. Sanctions were lifted with little to show in the way of nuclear disarmament. The rogue regime is now selling oil on the international market, and Iran has received access to tens of billions of dollars held abroad and has signed deals worth over $100 billion in foreign investment. Allowing Iran to have access to the dollar would mark an unprecedented additional concession to the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Access to the dollar would be an undeserved reward to a country that tortures its own people, denies human rights to women, and has the blood of Americans and our allies on its hands. But in an effort to advance the nuclear agreement, I worry that the President may act unilaterally—as he has done so often in the past—and permit the Treasury Department and other Federal entities to proceed with granting Iran the access to the dollar it so desperately wants. A vote for this amendment will eliminate that possibility. Mr. Chairman, let me say that this does not change what is currently the situation in this country. Last summer, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew testified that Iranian banks will not be able to clear U.S. dollars through New York, hold correspondent account relationships with U.S. financial institutions, or enter into financing agreements with U.S. banks. As the Secretary made clear, Iran, in other words, will continue to be denied access to the world’s largest financial and commercial market. This amendment simply puts that promise into statutory law, and that is why I have proposed it. The Lance amendment will eliminate any possibility that we might move in the other direction. Mr. Chairman, I urge its adoption. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I don’t, as you can see, have much to say on this because it is really an interesting situation. It is an amendment looking for a problem that doesn’t exist. It is an amendment looking for the possibility that the President— there we go again, the gentleman in the White House—that the President may do something he hasn’t said anything about doing. The Treasury Department says that there are no current plans to amend the regulation and that flexibility is not at issue at this point because no one is discussing this. The second part to this amendment is the underlying feeling by some Members still that the deal with Iran was a bad deal, that that deal won’t work, and that somehow we will be left holding the bag. Well, giving peace a chance, as the song says, is never a bad thing to do. I would hope that in the future we deal only with amendments that speak to an existing problem and not to an amendment that simply speaks about: What if? We have too many whatifs in amendments. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment and would hope that our colleagues would vote against it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, let me say that this is not designed against any one President. This would be put into statutory law, and it would proceed after this President leaves office. I believe that it is important that this fundamental principle—that Iran not have access to the U.S. dollar— should be in statutory law and not merely a matter of executive action. That is why I have proposed the amendment. I hope that all Members will consider the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to note that we speak about it, and it is not directed at any one President. But we have a unique system. We only have one President at a time. So it is directed at one President. I suspect that if we were going to stay in session—which we are not—for every week from now until the end of the year, we would see more and more and more bills—up to December 31— bills that would try to limit the power of the office of the Presidency because of who occupies it right now and the disdain that the other side, so many Members, have for our President. I see it differently. I see the Iran deal as a possibility for peace. Maybe history will say that I was naive. But I know the alternative, and the alternative is war. So any time that I can take a chance on evading and not having war, let’s go for it. Secondly, to legislate by suggesting that something could happen and therefore we have to head it off at the pass is not the way to legislate. I would hope that we could vote against this amendment. I urge opposition to it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by saying that the Iranian agreement is, of course, extremely controversial. It was voted down by the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, there was never any vote in the other House because cloture was not achieved. The President submitted the Iranian agreement as an agreement, not as a treaty, based upon the fact that legislation has been passed to make it an agreement. I think it is important that as a matter of statutory law we make sure that Iran not have access to the U.S. dollar, and that is why I propose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 38 OFFERED BY MR . KING OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 38 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, Number 38. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 794, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is an amendment that I offered before in the past. It simply says: ‘‘None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to enforce Executive Order 13166.’’ That is an executive order that was filed by thenPresident Clinton on August 16 in the year 2000, in the last months of his Presidency, that directs all Federal fund recipients—and that would include Federal contractors, State and local governments, as well as the Federal Government—to facilitate language interpretation with anyone who seeks to engage with them. That has been an executive order that has been highly costly not only to the taxpayers, but to the consumers in this country, in time and in money. It was one of the initial things that began to slow down this process of assimilation in America. We know that a common language is the most powerful unifying force known throughout all of history, whether it is English or whether it is some other language in some other country, and that we have a strong effort to establish English as the official language of the United States. I happen to be the author of that accomplishment in the State of Iowa. Thirty other States have English as the official language, and some 83 percent of Americans support this policy. Yet President Clinton’s executive order subverts this and works to fracture us rather than unify us. So it will save us billions of dollars. I didn’t bring that figure to the floor with me, but we know it has been very expensive over time. We are 16 years into this. It has been destructive to the unity of the American people. I want to see us united as a people, and this is one of the steps that we can take. I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I won’t speak in Spanish. I will only speak in English. The gentleman is a person that we all know well. He can’t pass up the opportunity to say something about immigrants and say something about English as the official language. Let me start off by saying this: I don’t speak for any community, and I certainly don’t know what other communities go through. But I can tell you that in the Hispanic/Latino community, when people sit around the dinner table and the issue of language comes up, it is not a plot against the English language. It is usually a conversation about how the children and the grandchildren no longer speak Spanish; they speak only English. That is just a fact. Number two, this assimilation issue, do you really think that someone would leave all their small belongings behind, leave in many cases their wife and their children to come into this country undocumented—assuming we are talking about undocumented people—before they can find a way to bring the rest of the family, to not learn English, to purposely keep themselves away from immigrating into the American society? On the contrary, some of the jokes are that some of the better—not better, but strongerfeeling Americans, the ones who want to vote, the ones who want to wave the flag strongly and proudly, are people who came from other countries. b1630 Just about everybody has somebody that came from another country, either now or a long time ago. The reason that President Clinton and so many of us have supported the issue—and I am speaking about the first President Clinton, not the next one—the fact that we support the issue of giving service is because in many ways this could be a constitutional question. I will give you an example. I am not a lawyer, but it says life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that is what we are promised. Well, life could be a paramedic being able to speak to you in a language that you understand. Liberty could be you in a trial getting an interpreter so what you have to say to that judge and to that jury can be understood. And the pursuit of happiness, of course, is a separate issue, but it allows you to grow two cultures at the same time. I speak Spanish, I speak English, and I am a Member of the U.S. Congress. I don’t think the fact that I speak Spanish has made me a worse Congressman or a worse American. I was born in an American territory that speaks a lot of Spanish. I grew up speaking Spanish and English at the same time. I am still working on both to be better at them every day, but I am a living example that there is nothing wrong with speaking more than one language. We in this country have a couple of fears that set us apart from the rest of the world and make us less than the rest of the world, and that is the fear of languages. In some other countries, in Europe and so on, children at the age of 10 speak two, three, or four languages; grownups speak a couple of languages. It doesn’t hurt them in any way. What is wrong if you speak another language? But here we are talking about services, going to the Department of Motor Vehicles and getting someone who can understand what you are saying until you learn to speak English. But trust me, the big line here is ‘‘until you speak English,’’ because no one wants to come here and remain only speaking Spanish or their own country’s language and forgetting English. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I would say first in response to the gentleman, and I respect his position and his background, but I would say if he had a development in the Greek language, he might think of that pursuit of happiness as what our Founding Fathers did. They called it eudaimonia, EUDAIMONIA, the Greek word. That means developing the whole human being—the body, the mind, the spirit, and the soul—all together. That pursuit of happiness wasn’t about a tailgate party. It was about becoming the best human being that you could. That is a little difference in the translation of the language that got lost. It is an example of how we are divided by language rather than unified by a common language. Another example would be Israel. It became a country in 1948. In 1954, they adopted Hebrew as their official language. I asked them why, and they said: Because we saw the example of the United States, that you have embraced English as your common language. It has unified the people. We needed to have a language to unify the Israelis. And it has been successful, and I could give you examples. One day I got in a taxicab and there was a gentleman there. He spoke perfect English and he didn’t seem to fit what a normal taxicab driver was. I said: Where were you raised? He said: Bosnia. How long have you been here? Seven years. Did you learn English before you came? Not a word. How can you speak perfect English in 7 years? He said: It helps when you have to. So I am not about discouraging the utilization of other languages, and this amendment does not do that. What it says is I am dispatched by the taxpayer dollars that are contributing to the division of America rather than let us have an encouragement to pull together in the same language. That is what this is about. It is a fiscally responsible amendment that addresses an 
83 percent majority in 31 States that have already taken this act. I urge its adoption. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I have been informed that the gentleman picked the wrong example—Israel—because they have more than one official language, but that is okay. The more the merrier. The fact of life is that the gentleman picked the example of someone who learned English. Well, everybody wants to learn to speak English. If you go to my community in the South Bronx, you see smallbusiness owners. Those are the best examples. Some of them speak what we would call broken English. Some of them speak perfect English. Their children, half of them no longer speak Spanish; they speak English. Their children are attending Fordham University or a university down South. They are not going to be bodega owners when they grow up, or cab drivers. They most likely will go work on Wall Street or somewhere else or teach. In other words, we have a pattern in this country that hasn’t been broken. What made us great is the fact that people come here, they adapt, they become part of this country, and then they defend this country with everything they have got, including their blood. That happens all the time, it happens all the time, and it is not going to stop happening. So if you have a worry—and I have heard you for years—that somehow speaking Spanish is going to wreck this country, on the contrary. Just learn to speak Spanish and you will feel much better. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I would say in response to the gentleman, I give some thought to the story of the Tower of Babel. We know that the construction manager there was Nimrod. He was building a tower to the heavens. They had the arrogance to believe that they could bypass God and get to heaven without Him. The Lord looked down on the Tower of Babel and He said: Behold, they are one people, they speak all one language, and nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. He scrambled their languages and scattered them to the four winds. Humanity on the planet has been at each other’s throats ever since. That is the message of the Tower of Babel. My message is unify us as one people. It is not discouraging the utilization of other languages, but it is discouraging the idea that we should establish ethic enclaves in America, that we should isolate ourselves somehow in these neighborhoods and not be assimilating into a broader neighborhood. I will give an example to the gentleman. When Bush was President and we had a representative from the Department of Labor who came to testify before the Small Business Committee, she said: We have a problem. We don’t have enough workers in the factories to run our punch presses and our lathes. Simple industrial work. Why is that? She said: Well, the applicants are not literate in the English language, and we have great difficulty in teaching them how to operate these machines. I said: I can understand that if they are firstgeneration immigrants. In fact, I can understand it if some of them are second generation. She cut me off and said: Even third generation. So the pickup of the language and the transition into the next generation is not happening at the speed it did because our enclaves are getting larger and more populated and people are more isolated into that. I want to encourage people to be successful, to go out and get an education and to assimilate more broadly. I want to be able to look across this country and know that I can walk into a city council meeting anywhere and know that it is being conducted in English. I want people to be able to talk and communicate with each other. When I go to a foreign country and they speak their language, I get the sense of that, too. We gravitate towards common kind, and the more common we can be, the more things we can have in common with each other, the more likely we are to be bonded together. That is what this amendment is about. I urge its adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 39 printed in House Report 114–639. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Customer Protection Act. That legislation included measures that would prohibit Operation Choke Point through increased transparency and responsible governance. This amendment is an important step in ensuring that the FDIC and other Federal banking regulators continue their job, but do so without abuse of power. I ask my colleagues for their support of this amendment which, again, has generated no opposition and has been adopted by voice vote in previous years. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, at the behest of the House Republicans’ inquiry, the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility investigated whether there was misconduct or targeting of legal businesses by Operation Choke Point. The DOJ’s OPR, in their report from last year, found that absolutely no wrongdoing had occurred. The DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility ‘‘concluded that the Department of Justice attorneys involved in Operation Choke Point did not engage in professional misconduct,’’ and that, ‘‘OPR’s inquiry further determined that Civil Division employees did not improperly target lawful participants.’’ Moreover, a followon report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation inspector general found that the FDIC’s involvement in Operation Choke Point was inconsequential to the direction and outcome of the initiative. Operation Choke Point is an enforcement action by the Department of Justice, whose funding is not addressed by this particular appropriations bill. In fact, that is part of the large problem with this amendment—that it really speaks to issues that belong in another bill. What this provision really does is tell the banking regulators not to cooperate with law enforcement when the Department of Justice has identified mass market fraud and other abuses of the payments system. The Department of Justice has made it a priority to hold the perpetrators of consumer fraud accountable. Recently, for example, they prosecuted the operators of lottery scams, the promoters of fake business opportunities, and the criminals behind a telemarketing fraud targeting Spanishspeaking customers. Preventing banking regulators from cooperating with legitimate law enforcement requests would restrict the ability of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch in enforcing consumer protection statutes throughout the United States. Operation Choke Point is just one of the Consumer Protection Branch’s efforts that require cooperation with banking regulators and which have produced significant results. b1645 For example, the Branch, together with U.S. Attorneys across the country, obtained over 150 criminal convictions and more than $7 billion in criminal fines, forfeitures, and restitution ordered to victims. Limiting the funding it receives would be a serious blow to consumers who need the protection of the government from the financial predators. This is something that we should not be doing at this point. We, certainly, shouldn’t be doing it in this bill, but we shouldn’t be doing it at all. I urge its opposition. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chair, as somebody who has been on both sides of the table with regard to financial services—as a regulator and on the other side of the table as a businessperson—I think I have a unique perspective on what is going on here. We also have a couple of reports from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee that took the emails of both of these agencies—their own emails—and showed them to be engaged in Operation Choke Point activities with the intent not to go after somebody who is doing something illegal, but to go after people who are doing something legal. That is the difference. I support, as the gentleman indicated a minute ago, some of the activities of the regulators in going after bad actors. I support that 110 percent. As a former regulator, I am with the gentleman all the way. My problem is what is going on with Operation Choke Point as we are going after legal businesses that are doing legal business. That is a big difference because their own emails indicate their own, internal attorneys—the legal authorities in their own agencies—questioned their own ability to be doing what they are doing. This should send a chill down the spine of every single American when you have the Department of Justice’s own attorneys telling them we shouldn’t be doing this because this is not legal. Yet this is the legal entity that is supposed to be leading our country and providing us protection with the law, itself. It is interesting because the FDIC has already implemented a lot of these changes that we requested in our bill. In committee—and to me, personally— they admitted what was going on and said: We are going to fix our problems. They admitted Operation Choke Point was going on and that they were targeting legal businesses that were doing legal business. They said: We can’t have that. We are going to stop it. The problem is it is continuing to go on, as I indicated in my testimony. Just this week, there was another one. I have an email address that takes information from individuals who have been wronged by Operation Choke Point activities. They are in legal businesses, doing legal business. And we got another hit just this week. Over the last several months, we have had numerous hits from different businesses across the country. Yet we have continued to see this happen. I ask for the support of the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE MEYER ). The amendment was agreed to.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. PETERS. I am in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Peters moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5485 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: In the ‘‘Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence—Salaries and Expenses’’ account, on page 4, line 2, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $5,000,000)’’. Page 92, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,000,000)’’. Page 96, line 17, after the dollar amount relating to rental of space, insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,000,000)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It will not require that it go back for further action. My amendment would increase funding for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence by $5 million. It is our responsibility as a Congress to provide the American people with financial security, national security, and security in the belief that their voice counts in Washington, D.C. Instead, the underlying bill rolls back reforms put in place after the 2008 financial collapse, further undermines the campaign finance system, reduces access to affordable health care, and underfunds the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which is tasked with targeting the finances of terrorist groups. In an era of new and dynamic threats, we need a tough, smart national security strategy to keep Americans safe. Even as we counter aggressors like China and Russia, we are faced with threats from nonstate terrorist groups like ISIS, al Qaeda, and the Taliban. Our military has taken the fight to them. In May, an American drone strike in Pakistan killed Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, and as of June 28, the U.S. military and its coalition partners had conducted over 13,000 strikes against ISIS. Those strikes have destroyed over 26,000 targets in Iraq and Syria. Coupled with our brave special operators on the ground, this air campaign has helped our allies make considerable progress in the fight against ISIS. ISIS has lost 45 percent of the territory it once held in Iraq and 20 percent of what it once held in Syria, and ISIS no longer occupies strongholds like Fallujah and Ramadi. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis recently said: ‘‘There has been no strategic victory for ISIS in over a year now.’’ But even as we have taken back territory and degraded their capabilities, the last few months have demonstrated ISIS’ prevailing ability to direct or inspire attacks in the West. Paris, Brussels, Baghdad, Istanbul, and recently Orlando—ISIS’ ability to direct or inspire attacks poses a clear threat to our security and to American lives at home and abroad. 
In the United States, we have seen how difficult it is for our law enforcement and intelligence agencies to stop lonewolf attackers inspired by ISIS, and in Europe we have seen the devastation that highly coordinated ISISdirected terrorist attacks can inflict on soft targets like airports and train stations. These attacks involved terrorist fighters financed by ISIS using militarygrade weaponry. In many cases, the fighters traveled to and from the Middle East to be trained. Even as we kill their leaders, destroy their safe havens, and take back their territory, the threat from ISIS will not be eliminated until we remove their ability to direct and finance terrorist attacks. Created by President Bush in 2004, the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence has extensive and critical responsibilities that include combating terrorist financing domestically and internationally. They work with law enforcement, diplomats, and intelligence agencies, and with the private sector and foreign governments to identify and eliminate sources of financing for terrorist networks. They also combat financial support for the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence cuts lines of financial support, freezes assets, and makes it harder for terrorist cells to finance and carry out attacks. By hitting the terrorists where it hurts—in their wallets—our financial intelligence officers make Americans safer. My amendment will provide the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence with the additional resources it needs to carry out this mission; and moving forward, the House should also consider bipartisan legislation introduced by Representatives SINEMA and FITZPATRICK to develop a coordinated governmentwide strategy to combat terrorist financing. By supporting this smart, targeted approach to undermining terrorist networks, we can support the American pilots and special operators who are risking their lives in the fight against terrorism, and we can help prevent future attacks. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I would really like to thank the gentleman for bringing this motion to recommit to increase funding for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence by $5 million because it makes an excellent point as to why this bill is such a good bill, because this bill already funds the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence higher than it has ever been funded in the history of that office. I don’t think we need to give them another $5 million. They have got more than they can deal with right now. They are happy we did that. What this bill does is deal with the big problems we face here in Washington. Number one, we spend money that we don’t have, and up here in Washington, we exercise power that nobody gave us, and we deal with that right here. We lower the spending under this bill by 5.6 percent. We are getting a handle on the outofcontrol spending. But we spend money where we ought to spend it, like the SBA. They help small businesses get the loans and make the next big deal. They grow the economy. They create jobs. b2100 The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence enforces sanctions. They get extra money. That is great. But guess what? The way we reduce spending overall is we take money away from those agencies that waste money. In fact, we cut spending on 12 different agencies. We lower spending and we eliminate 6 agencies altogether. So we are dealing with that part of it. And, by the way, one of the big problems in Washington is exercising all this regulatory overreach. We kind of rein that in here. We say to some of these agencies: Stop, stop, stop. Pause. The Federal Communications Commission, they oversee one of the most creative, innovative aspects of our economy; and yet they are more active than ever before. So we say: Stop making these politically charged rules and get back to your core mission. So at the end of the day, it is a good bill. Let me just tell you I have got four good reasons, but let me tell you two quick good reasons. This is the fourth time I have brought this bill before the House. Every year, the bill gets better and better. I am going tell you right now, this is the best bill that I have ever brought before the House. That ought to be one good reason. The other reason is, since I am leaving this year, this is the last time I will ever bring the bill. Finally, just let me say to everybody here, if everybody is willing to rein in this wasteful spending, then you will like this bill; if you are ready to exercise a little courage and say to those nameless, faceless bureaucrats, We are going to put an end to regulatory rampage, then vote ‘‘no.’’ I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise for one purpose. I rise to recognize the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CRENSHAW ) on his last Financial Services bill. Mr. Speaker, I know they are not rising because it is his last bill. They are rising because this man has always been a gentleman and a statesman regardless of what side of the aisle he has been on. He has represented the Fourth District of Florida for 15 years. His leadership will be shown on so many pieces of legislation, but his heart, his passion, and his persuasion was really shown on the ABLE Act. He never gave up. Because of the ABLE Act, it is now helping millions of Americans with disabilities lead more independent lives. He has changed their lives. So I think I speak for all Members in wishing him well in his retirement and his quest to become a scratch golfer. Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for the electronic vote on the question of passage. This is a 5minute vote. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 183, nays 241, not voting 9, as follows: [Roll No. 397] YEAS—183

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart, knowing what has transpired in the last 48 hours has been horrific. Two men—fathers, brothers, sons—gunned down by law enforcement. We understand that our police have a job to do that can be difficult, but we need restraint from our law enforcement officers until they are able to determine whether there is a threat or not. You cannot be a threat just because you are an African American in a car. No one should die being stopped for a taillight. And Mr. Castile, in Minnesota, was very compliant. He had told the officer he was reaching for his wallet and lost his life. There is something wrong in the United States of America, and we need to address it soon. 
AN AMERICAN PROBLEM (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I made a request in the Judiciary Committee to our chairperson to have hearings on this issue. We have a bill that would require each State to set up a system of independent prosecutors to look at law enforcement killings, shootings. The fact is an Attorney General can’t look at a law enforcement shooting without prejudicing their ability to do their jobs. They work hand in glove with law enforcement, and if they have to police law enforcement, they have a problem in effectively doing their jobs later on. We have asked that each State set up a system of independent prosecutors so people know there is justice and fairness and oversight. That is reasonable, and we should have hearings. What happened in Baton Rouge, what happened in Minnesota has happened in New York, has happened in North Charleston. It has happened in Cleveland, Ohio. It has happened in Memphis, Tennessee. And African American men are subject to being shot for reasons that others aren’t. Police need to be more careful, and we need to see that our country takes this, as President Obama has in his statement from Europe: this is an American problem. f 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. POEof Texas (at the request of Mr. MCCARTHY ) for today after 6 p.m. and for the balance of the week on account of personal reasons. Mr. TURNER (at the request of Mr. MCCARTHY ) for July 6 after 7:30 p.m. and for the balance of the week on account of his address to the Heads of State and Government in his role as President and Chairman of the U.S. Delegation to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Parliamentary Assembly at the 2016 Warsaw Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
