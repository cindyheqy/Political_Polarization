Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise along with my colleagues, Congresswoman N
ANCY  P
ELOSI , Congressman J ARED HUFFMAN and Congressman M
IKETHOMPSON , to recognize Roger Thomas, Captain of the Salty Lady, member of the California Outdoor Hall of Fame, and lifelong advocate to keep west coast salmon fisheries alive and sustainable. Many in this chamber, the California Legisla-ture and multiple agencies have worked with Roger for decades and are proud to call this honorable and remarkable man a friend, men-tor and colleague. He is one of the most de-cent and hard-working human beings one can know. Roger’s passion for fishing started as a child. Born in Gilroy, California, he started fish-ing at an early age for striped bass from the beaches along Monterey Bay and later for salmon from a small boat launched at the Monterey Pier. He was hooked on salmon fishing and became a regular customer on charter boats out of San Francisco. Before too long, one of the captains offered Roger a job as a deck hand and, as they say, the rest is history. Roger received his captain’s license in 1968. While working full-time for the County of Santa Clara on housing issues, he ran charter boats on weekends. At one point he had ac-quired a fleet of five boats that were run by several captains. In 1981, he retired from his government job and dedicated all of his time and energy to fisheries and ocean conserva-tion. There hasn’t been a salmon related asso-ciation or council that Roger hasn’t served on. Since 1973, he has been the President of the Golden Gate Fishermen’s Association which represents charter boats from Fort Bragg to Monterey and carries some 200,000 anglers each year. He is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Golden Gate Salmon Association which represents com-mercial and recreational fishermen and works on protecting salmon habitat. For 14 years, he has served on the Pacific Fisheries Manage-ment Council which, among other duties, sets the ocean salmon seasons. Roger is a mem-ber of the Bay Delta Advisory board, the Win-ter Run-Captive Broodstock Committee, the Central Valley Fisheries Coalition, the Marine Advisory Committee to the Secretary of Com-merce, the Coastal Resources Foundation, the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, the National Sea Grant Review Panel and the Marine Resources Committee. Roger runs his charters on the Salty Lady out of Sausalito and Half Moon Bay. He proudly calls himself a salmon charter oper-ation, but additionally runs whale watching and nature trips and has introduced thousands of children and adults to the magic of marine life. He has spent more than 10,000 days on the ocean and you will be hard-pressed to find someone with deeper knowledge and appre-ciation for that ecosystem. He also has the gift of storytelling and a mind that remembers every detail, including one of his most vivid ones from his childhood. He saw the last of the San Joaquin Spring run chinook salmon before they went extinct. His uncle took him to Friant Dam right after it was constructed. The salmon were stuck at the end of the line im-posed to divert water to fields in the San Joa-quin valley. They were ‘‘big fish,’’ Roger says stretching out his arms, ‘‘just big fish.’’ Roger is a familiar face in Congress where he has represented the interests of the charter boat fleet and the health of west coast salmon stocks for decades. In the 1980s, he was ap-pointed by then Vice President George Bush to the National Sea Grant Review Panel. In this role he traveled to ports around the coun-try and helped decide which projects were worthy and would be funded. Roger was instrumental in former Rep-resentative George Miller’s 1992 Central Val-ley Improvement Act and its eventual pas-sage. The CVP is a key law to stop environ-mental harm to salmon and the Bay Delta. When salmon populations collapsed in 2008 and 2009, Roger worked closely with Rep-resentative M
IKETHOMPSON to provide dis-aster relief to salmon fishermen. Roger Thomas’ tireless work has earned him the respect and adoration of countless people. With his recent tragic diagnosis of late stage cancer, it is our intention through these extended remarks in the C
ONGRESSIONAL  R
ECORD to express our appreciation for his outstanding work and lasting contributions. Mr. Speaker, I ask the Members of the House of Representatives to join us in cele-brating the life of Roger Thomas who loves fish, loves the ocean, and above all loves peo-ple. He has touched many hearts, protected many livelihoods and has earned the admira-tion of coastal communities up and down the western seaboard.

WELCOMING PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 6, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome President Moon Jae-in of the Repub-lic of Korea upon his first visit to the United States. Rooted in rich history, the United States and the Republic of Korea share a special relation-ship based on robust bonds of collaboration and camaraderie. The most illustrative mani-festations of American and Korean partnership have been the economic and security alli-ances formed since the early 1950s. Together, we have worked to thwart the spread of terri-torial and international threats while also en-gaging in mutually beneficial trade and invest-ment. In the 21st century, our special relation-ship will only expand as we face new chal-lenges to regional and global security and pro-mote free and fair trade. Our nations must forge ahead to put an end to North Korea’s nuclear program. Failure on this front would compromise global peace and state sov-ereignty. And, ultimately, we must continue to seek an end to the conflict between the North and the South—which has destroyed lives and entire families—by reunifying the Korean Pe-ninsula. As our nations encounter a critical moment in history—a moment simultaneously fraught with peril yet abound with oppor-tunity—this visit provides an opportunity to en-hance our established commitment to security and the advancement of strategic interests. Mr. Speaker, I welcome President Moon and look forward to our continuous and pros-perous partnership with the Republic of Korea.

HONORING MARYAM MOHSENZA- DEH, RECIPIENT OF THE AMER-ICAN DREAM AWARD

Dr. Mohsenzadeh grew up in a small town in Iran, where she did not have the right to an education.

Dr. Mohsenzadeh transformed her suffering into the empathy she needs in order to be a focused, compassionate and fearless dentist for the most vulnerable members of our com-munity.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RAYMOND V. WALENDZAK HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 6, 2017 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Raymond V. Walendzak, who served for over 20 years as the Chief of the Oregon Fire Department. Ray passed away in his Oregon home surrounded by his family on June 7, 2017. Ray was born in Toledo, Ohio on Sep-tember 27, 1941 to Joan and Stanley Walendzak. He played football and wrestled for Clay High School, from which he grad-uated in 1959. Ray continued his education at Findlay College, and then joined the United States Air Force and served in West Ger-many. In 1968, Ray became an Oregon firefighter, where he began his service in the depart-ment’s maintenance division, became a fire prevention officer, a district chief, and the as-sistant chief. Ray’s father also served as a firefighter, which helped Ray bridge the dif-ferences between the different generations who were serving as firefighters. He appre-ciated the traditions of fire service, and also the need to modernize fire service with tech-nology. Ray became Fire Chief in 1986 and retired in 2007 for a total of 39 years of fire service. While Fire Chief, Ray made sure his depart-ment was current in training and technology, and made sure that the department had the right equipment. Ray has said that his biggest achievement was getting a fire training facility built in Oregon. His passion about the fire-fighting commu-nity led him to serve its various organizations which include serving as the past president of the Ohio Fire Chiefs Association, Lucas Coun-ty Fire Chiefs Association, Oregon Fire Fight-ers Association, Ottawa County Fireman’s As-sociation, and, for over 26 years, as past president and secretary of the Northwest Ohio Volunteer Fire Association. He had received the Ohio Fire Chiefs’ Asso-ciation’s Distinguished Service Award, and was inducted into the Ohio Fire Service Hall of Fame. Ray served as a Governor appointee to the State of the Ohio Board of Emergency Medical Services for 12 years. He was in-ducted into the Clay High School Hall of Fame in 2014. Ray’s commitment to his community did not just stop with the fire department—it extended through his service to his church, St. Ignatius, and through many of the civic organizations he was a member of: the American Legion Christ Dunberger Post No. 537, Knights of Co-lumbus, Swiss Club at the GAF, and the Clay Boosters. Ray dedicated an enormous amount of time to the youth of his community, where he was a longtime coach of youth baseball through the Oregon Recreation Department. Ray also served as a football coach at Oregon Clay High School. His dedication to the young members of his community led him to run for four terms on the Oregon Board of Education where he also served as Board President. Ray will be remembered for his dedication to his chosen profession of Fire Fighting and for his dedication to the Oregon community at large. We offer Ray’s children, Dean, Donald and Dennis, his six grandchildren, his family and friends our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of what Ray had meant to each of the institutions that he served.

HON. KAREN BASS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 6, 2017 Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, today I congratu-late Diane Griffiths on a long career of service to the State of California, and on her retire-ment on June 1, 2017. Diane Griffiths served many years as chief of staff to my friend and former colleague in the California legislature, Robert Hertzberg, in-cluding during his two terms as the 64th Speaker of the California Assembly, as well as after his election to the California Senate. As a former Speaker myself, I know how vital a role the Speaker’s chief of staff plays in the success of each legislative session and the legislature overall. Diane worked diligently to keep herself informed on the substance of a wide range of issues, while also handling the myriad management tasks involved in the run-ning of an operation as complex as a legisla-tive leadership office. She has worked in the Legislature in many different roles and handled a broad range of policy, legal and administrative issues. Sen-ator Hertzberg describes her as ‘‘the consum-mate chief of staff’’ and praises her for always striving to help others to be as effective as possible. Previously, Diane served as chief of staff to the University of California Board of Regents. She was also General Counsel to California’s Fair Political Practices Commission. A grad-uate of the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, she clerked for the California and Alaska Supreme Courts after graduation. Diane will be missed, but I appreciate the decades of service that she gave to the citi-zens of California and I wish her all the best in her new endeavors. f
