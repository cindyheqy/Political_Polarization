Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, for the past few years, I have been on the floor from time to time railing on the loss of life and waste of money in Afghanistan. I believe we have too many in Congress who are not listening to our men and women in uniform and are actually not even listening to the taxpayers who are paying the bill to be in Afghanistan. From articles written about paying for ghost soldiers—that means that they don’t exist—to the Department of Defense spending $6 million to buy nine goats, the stories just go on and on and on. There are so many examples of waste, fraud, and abuse, it is time that we in Congress realize that it is not in our best interest to stay there for 16 more years. We have already been there 16 years. And, you know, you get to a point that you just wonder. And so many of our young men and women who have fought for our country in Iraq and Afghanistan are special heroes to all of us, and we know that. This is about the policy of the Congress, not the military policy. Recently, I read an article that the former President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has actually been meeting with the Russians and asking the Russians to come back to Afghanistan, and he, Hamid Karzai, will set up meetings with the Taliban. But sometimes you just wonder who in the world is watching this absolutely wild crazy world of Afghanistan. Then this past week, there was another article, and I will read the title of the article, Madam Speaker: ‘‘Chinese Troops Appear to Be Operating in Afghanistan and the Pentagon is Okay With It.’’ Again, I repeat myself: after 16 years of war in Afghanistan, hasn’t the American soldier done enough? Hasn’t the American taxpayer paid enough for goats and paying ghost soldiers? 200,000 Afghans who don’t even exist are getting paid, so that means that the money ends up in the hands of the Taliban or the village leaders. You know, if the Chinese want to spend 16 years in Afghanistan, so be it. Let them have it. Think about the history of Afghanistan, Madam Speaker. Alexander the Great was the first, and then we had the Brits that went in. In fact, Winston Churchill was a young reporter when they were in Afghanistan and he was very disillusioned with that world. Then the Russians went in for 10 years and then they left, and now we have been there 16 years. Afghanistan is a graveyard of empires. It is time for us to start looking at the sensibility of what we are doing there and does it make any sense, which is a better way of saying it. I think that at some time, Afghanistan being the graveyard of empires, there is probably a headstone that says ‘‘Russia.’’ After 16 years, maybe there will be a headstone that says ‘‘USA.’’ And who knows? If the Chinese go and stay 16 years, there might be another headstone that says ‘‘China.’’ At that time, maybe the ghost soldiers can take the $6 million goats out to the graveyard and let them eat the grass or something. I don’t know, Madam Speaker. It gets a little bit crazy. It really does. It is time for this Congress to debate whether our policy is to stay in Afghanistan or to come home from Afghanistan. I close with this. These two little girls from my district are Eden and Stephanie Balduf. Their daddy, Kevin Balduf, was a sergeant from Camp Lejeune, which is in my district. He and Colonel Palmer, from Cherry Point Marine Air Station, which also is in my district, were sent to Afghanistan to train Afghanis to be policemen. These two little girls are at the funeral of their daddy. Their daddy, Sergeant Kevin Balduf, emailed his wife the day before he was shot and killed, along with Colonel Palmer, and said: I don’t trust them. I don’t trust them. I don’t trust any of them. So I say to these two little girls, your United States Congress needs to debate whether we need to stay in Afghanistan longer than the 16 years we have been there, or is it time to say we have done our job and it is time to come home. 
DAY WITHOUT A WOMAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BARRAGA ´N) for 5 minutes. Ms. BARRAGA´N. Madam Speaker, today I rise to stand in solidarity on a Day Without a Woman. You will see women in red today and men with red ties in honor of today. It is 2017 and we still need a Day Without a Woman to remind this administration and Republicans in Congress that women deserve equal pay and access to affordable health care. Just yesterday, the assault on women continued with the GOP’s plan to pay more for less in healthcare legislation that will restrict a woman’s right to comprehensive healthcare coverage. The Republican bill also defunds Planned Parenthood. Women with nowhere else to turn will lose access to essential preventative care and affordable contraception. This is very personal for me. When I was growing up, we were poor. I had a sister that got pregnant at 15 and another one that got pregnant at 16. I, myself, had a condition that required me to get on a contraceptive to deal with pain that I had. I had nowhere to turn. I, myself, had to go to a clinic that saw me on a sliding scale; otherwise, I would have had nowhere to go. The fact that we are facing the threat of losing this today for women and preventive care is beyond incomprehensible to me and scary. On this day today, without a woman, I also think about women, women like Rosa Parks, the mothers, the daughters and grandchildren that took part in the Women’s March on January 21, women at the forefront of every fight for equality. I stand today with women like my mother, Teresa, an immigrant from Mexico, who raised a large family and who took care of my father when he was sick and continues to support me today. I stand today to fight for equal pay for equal work because women—and Latinas in particular—are paid only 54 cents for every $1 paid to White men. I fight in Congress for American families so that they have economic stability and can make ends meet and set their kids off to a brighter future. I will continue to fight with my sisters in Congress for health care, for immigration, and for human rights. All of these are women’s rights. 
SUPPORTING THE 2017 MONKEY MADNESS 5K RUN AND WALK The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JONES ). The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage everyone in south Florida to come out to Zoo Miami this Sunday, March 12, for the Families for Fragile X Monkey Madness 5K Run/ Walk. Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability, which results in a wide range of mental and physical impairments. It is also the most common known genetic cause of autism. Through events like the upcoming 5K run/walk, organizations like the National Fragile X Foundation and the Families for Fragile X are working to raise awareness and advance groundbreaking research. These events also bring together those impacted by fragile X in our community and provide them with essential support and encouragement so that no one family has to go through this journey alone. I ask everyone in south Florida to join Michele and her son Matthew, as well as hundreds of other patients, caregivers, and friends whose lives have been impacted by fragile X, this Sunday for the Monkey Madness 5K Run/Walk. You can register at familiesforfragilex.com. RECOGNIZING THE FRIENDSHIP CIRCLE OF MIAMI  
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Friendship Circle of Miami, a program provided by the Chabad of Kendall & Pinecrest that offers muchneeded acceptance to children and young individuals with special needs by providing them with the skills to become our future leaders. Since its inception, the Friendship Circle has provided these vulnerable members of our society the opportunity to participate in many programs like organized sports or visual and performing arts, all while building lasting friendships. The Friendship Circle has grown from a small organization that started in Detroit to now having chapters all across our Nation and, indeed, around the world. I would like to offer a special congratulations to our Miami chapter, as it recently held its annual Walk for Friendship, raising awareness and support for the programs and services offered to our youth. Mr. Speaker, it is organizations like Friendship Circle that serve as the pillar of equality and celebrate each person’s individual qualities that make them great. I ask south Florida to join members of our community like the Pardo family—Angel, Rosie, and Andrew—in bringing a smile to the faces of some very special children in our community. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, March 1 marked the 56th anniversary of the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps’ talented volunteers have accomplished a lot over the years, serving in over 140 countries across the globe. They have changed millions of lives, provided immeasurable technical assistance to communities in need, and helped create a better understanding between Americans and peoples abroad. In 2011, I was proud to author a bill that helped protect Peace Corps volunteers. The Senate companion to that bill became law as the Kate Puzey Act, establishing policies that improved volunteer safety and ensured that they would have the resources necessary to contend with emergencies. Peace Corps volunteers exemplify the extraordinary compassion and leadership of our great Nation, and their security is paramount as they carry out their missions abroad. I congratulate the Peace Corps on its 56th anniversary, and I wish it even greater success in the years ahead. CONGRATULATING JONATHAN AGUIAR AND THE  
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Jonathan Aguiar, a wonderful student at Christopher Columbus High School, whom I recently met, for his efforts that are known as KNOW MORE. He started this organization KNOW MORE, and it is an organization founded to raise awareness about sexual assault on high school campuses in south Florida. Anyone, regardless of age, can become a victim of sexual assault. Unfortunately, it is a crime that often goes unreported due to the detrimental scars felt by some victims. By joining together to create KNOW MORE, Jonathan and his friends have undertaken a noble effort to support victims, protect others from harm, and prepare high school students to make informed decisions. I thank Jonathan and Christopher Columbus High School for their work and advocacy to combat this issue that affects so many in our community and across the Nation. 
MARINES UNITED The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, I stood on this same floor and condemned the online bullying of U.S. Marine Corps servicewomen on a public Facebook page. Today I stand before you again, incredulous, angry, and sad, to say that absolutely nothing has changed. This weekend, news broke that the Department of Defense is investigating scores of enlisted marines for compiling thousands of naked photos of other marines—servicewomen—often surreptitiously, and distributing them through Facebook and Google Drive. The site in question is called ‘‘Marines United,’’ claiming a membership of over 30,000 people. The photos are being tightly held due to the ongoing investigation, but all indications are they are just as repulsive as what we saw 4 years ago. b1015 The report contains samples of the comments posted about female marines, which are too obscene to read on the House floor. Online commentators also reportedly called for the rape of some of the marines portrayed in the photos, which is terrifying, given many of the women are identified by name and base. 
This is not about sex or fun or boys will be boys. This is about marines deliberately trying to degrade, humiliate, and threaten fellow marines. They encouraged stalking, distributed stolen intimate photos, and reduced their comrades to a collection of body parts. Well, I am here to say that women marines will not be treated like sides of beef. They are warriors and should be treated as such. As one female marine who recently completed the once maleonly infantry training said: ‘‘Right now I’m supposed to be able to trust every male marine. And with some of the stuff I see them saying about women, that’s just not happening.’’ This cultural rot, which has clearly regressed even further since 2013, harms our troops and our readiness. It is abundantly clear that this is not a few bad marines; rather, it is another example of a culture of rot. It is a blight that infects not just the ranks of the enlisted, but also the officer corps. Military leadership has utterly failed in their responsibility to protect their troops, punish those involved, and uphold the professed values of the Corps. That is why the survivors of this latest atrocity did not have the confidence to notify their superiors, for fear of retribution. It took a marine veteran and blogger to blow the whistle, and for that, he has been threatened with death and his wife has been threatened with rape. Back in 2013, thenCommandant General Amos wrote to me saying, ‘‘We share your indignation,’’ regarding deplorable images on social media that denigrate women in the United States Marine Corps. They were words—just words. I fear that military leadership will say anything to placate Congress and an outraged public, but then do nothing. I recently had the opportunity to meet with Secretary of Defense James Mattis. I found him to be engaging, thoughtful, and committed to our troops. Secretary Mattis is also a retired marine. Secretary Mattis, I hope that you are deeply disturbed by what we are seeing within the Corps. I hope that you are listening to servicewomen like the one whose private photos were posted in the 2013 Facebook group. One left the service in 2015, and says that just knowing her pictures are still out there has silenced her. She said: ‘‘I wanted to be a positive influence on the community. And this diminished me. It took away everything.’’ Secretary Mattis, this must change now. I call on you to hold your leadership accountable for these failures; to establish a culture of dramatic change. That means heads should roll. Talk is cheap. Action is what is needed for the integrity of the military. Survivors must be supported. That will only happen if those bad marines are drummed out of the Corps, with no exceptions. JCC THREATS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) for 5 minutes. Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I rise today because there have now recently been at least 100 threats made against more than 75 Jewish community centers across the country. These threats and the recent vandalism of Jewish cemeteries are despicable. I can probably find much more harsh language to use, but we probably shouldn’t use it here on the House floor. Community centers of all faiths should be places where people can find peace and not feel targeted for their beliefs. As a nation, we have to demonstrate that we will do everything within our power to prevent future threats and stop potential attacks. One of my first acts as a new Member of Congress was to join the bipartisan task force to combat antiSemitism. I am sad that we even have to do this. Our group works across the aisle to combat global antiSemitism. I have also cosponsored the Combating European AntiSemitism Act, which instructs the Secretary of State to track antiSemitism in Europe. But it is clear from these attacks, Madam Speaker, that we must also do far more here at home to combat anti Semitism. In the coming days, I will be working with my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to determine the additional steps that we can take to combat antiSemitism in the United States and keep our communities safe. I make this encouragement. I encourage all of my colleagues to ask themselves one question: What if it were their child’s elementary school? What if it were their child’s daycare? What if it were their child’s afterschool program that had the threat of a bomb, just like the one that took my own legs? 
RESIST APPEAL PROPOSAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the proposal offered by the Republican majority to replace the Affordable Care Act. After nearly 7 years of repeal votes, House Republicans finally released their healthcare proposal on Monday. Simply stated, this proposal is bad for seniors, it is bad for the poor, and it is bad for the sick. It costs more and offers less. It raises cost on middle class Americans while giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy and to special interests. Madam Speaker, more than 12,000 of my constituents receive financial assistance to buy health insurance on the exchange in the commercial market. Almost all of them will get less help under the Republican proposal. Why is that? Because the proposed tax credits will vary by age and income, which means premiums will be unaffordable for the low to moderateincome families and seniors. As premiums go up with healthcare costs over time, these tax credits don’t rise, making insurance less affordable year after year. Regarding the individual mandate, while removing it may be politically popular, experts who have studied this expect premiums to increase 25 percent when the individual mandate is eliminated. When the employer mandate is eliminated under the GOP proposal, fewer employers will offer insurance to their employees. Furthermore, Madam Speaker, I am opposed to the GOP proposal because it will significantly raise healthcare costs on individuals in their fifties and sixties. And why is that? Because the plan will allow insurers to charge them five times more than younger policyholders. In fact, if you are 60 years or older and making an average income, under the GOP proposal your insurance bill will go up by $3,200 each year while you lose $6,000 in tax credits and subsidies. Madam Speaker, nearly 30,000 men, women, and children in my district are currently covered by the Medicaid expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Each of them now stands to lose coverage if the Republican Congress eliminates Maryland’s Medicaid expansion. Even our Republican Governor understands that much. The GOP plan to socalled modernize Medicaid essentially turns the program into a block grant program that shifts the costs to States. States simply cannot afford that. As a result, we will eventually see massive cuts to this costefficient program. This plan to turn Medicaid into a block grant program would hurt the working poor, children, seniors, and people with disabilities that rely on this program. This is wrong and disgraceful. And why do Republicans want to cut Medicaid, Madam Speaker? I am not sure, but I do know they are also proposing huge tax cuts for the wealthy. Under Monday’s midnight proposal, we now see that the 400 wealthiest households in America will receive annual tax cuts of $7 million. The proposal also includes a tax break for insurance companies that pay their CEOs over half a million dollars a year. Madam Speaker, the Republicans kept this proposal under lock and key for a reason. They scheduled a committee markup without a single hearing or even a CBO score. The American people and their Representatives deserve to see the numbers. That means every Member of this Congress needs to hear from the Congressional Budget Office: How much will it cost taxpayers? How will it impact our hospitals and health centers? 
How many people will lose the health coverage they have right now? The American public demands and deserves to know. Madam Speaker, this is not regular order and this is not why I came to Congress. When Democrats introduced the Affordable Care Act, whether you supported it or not, we held 79 hearings over 2 years, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, and posted the bill online 30 days before markup. The Republicans have done none of these things. That is hypocritical and shameful. We will resist this dangerous repeal proposal, Madam Speaker. 
TRUMP HOTEL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss another glaring and scandalous drama involving President Trump’s conflict of interest that has been lost in the shuffle of the President’s nightly tweets and the daily Russian revelations. I would like to talk about the Old Post Office Building down the street on Pennsylvania Avenue. The General Services Administration solicited proposals for redevelopment of the Old Post Office Building in 2011, selected The Trump Organization in 2012, and signed a 60year lease in 2013 to redevelop the building. For the first time in U.S. history, a sitting President now operates and profits from a private business in a taxpayerowned Federal building. The Old Post Office Building lease agreement explicitly prohibits any elected official of the U.S. Government from serving as a lessee or from profiting under the lease. Before the President took office, career officials at GSA confirmed that the prohibition on elected officials benefiting from the lease is a categorical ban on any elected official, including the President, being a party to or benefiting from the lease. The prohibition not allowing elected officials to benefit from GSA leases exists because of the outsized influence elected officials, especially the President, have over the funding and management of GSA. President Trump has violated the very terms of the lease agreement that his company entered into with the United States Government for the Trump International Hotel the very moment that he took the oath of office to become President of the United States of America. Soon, President Trump will appoint the administrator who serves at the pleasure of the President. That same administrator will be responsible for administering and managing the lease where the guy who signs his paycheck is the guy who benefits from the lease. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a classic conflict of interest. To try to hide this conflict, President Trump has announced a socalled divestment plan that has two of his adult children responsible for negotiating with the GSA on behalf of daddy. If you think daddy’s kids won’t make sure that daddy is happy with the administrator and if you think that the administrator won’t make sure that the kids are happy with him, then you would be the one who would buy some oceanfront property in Chicago. Essentially, the President controls the man exercising judgment on his lease. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has repeatedly written to the GSA trying to get more information about this glaring problem, but we have not received a substantial response. On March 7, 2017, Ranking Member PETER DEFAZIO and I wrote to the GSA Inspector General requesting that they examine administration and management of the Old Post Office Building lease. b1030 Congress needs an independent investigation to determine how and when GSA plans to resolve this breach of the lease and eliminate this conflict of interest, how GSA is shielding the career officials working through this conflict, and whether GSA is receiving fair market value for any amendments to the lease. This lease has already been amended five times, without any congressional oversight. There is also the elephant in the room as to whether this Trump hotel business is violating the U.S. Constitution. It is unclear whether payments by foreign governments to the Trump International Hotel provide evidence of a violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. There are also serious allegations of whether foreign diplomats are steering business toward the Trump International Hotel. Could it be that Putin has already made arrangements to rent the presidential penthouse suite in the Trump Hotel for $10 million a year for the next 4 years? Or perhaps he has paid $100 million for an option to lease the Grand Ballroom at the Trump Hotel over the next 4 years. The American people need and deserve answers to these very important questions. President Trump and GSA need to come clean and address these conflict of interest issues in a transparent fashion that protects the interests of the American taxpayers. 
COACH STEVE CHAPMAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Speaker, today I am here to congratulate Calallen High School baseball coach Steve Chapman on his recent induction into the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame. Coach Chapman was born and raised in Hallettsville, Texas. After graduating from Hallettsville High School, he attended Blinn College and the University of Mary HardinBaylor, where he received a degree in education. After graduation, he began his coaching career at Victoria Stroman High School as an assistant coach. In 1983, he became head baseball coach at Calallen High School. In Coach Chapman’s 33 years at Calallen, his Wildcats have won or shared 25 district championships and have been to the Region 4 finals 19 times. The Wildcats have reached the UIL State tournament on 12 occasions, played in the State championship game 8 times, and have won 3 State championships. Coach Chapman’s overall record is 967 wins, 204 losses, and 2 ties. Coach Chapman’s induction into the Hall of Fame is a testament to his hard work and the thousands of lives he has touched while coaching the Wildcats, including my longtime legislative director, Blake Adami. I offer my congratulations to Coach Chapman, his family, and everyone at Calallen. f 
REPLACING THE ACA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK) for 5 minutes. Mr. HECK. Madam Speaker, today I would like to share a letter I received from Sherry, who lives back in my hometown of Olympia, Washington. Sherry writes to me: 
My husband was a veteran. He worked as a civilian with high security clearance at White Sands Missile Range and later as a paramedic and firefighter. When I met him, I was working as a paramedic, also. We were crazy in love. But I lost him to cancer in 2009, at the age of 56. Since the day my husband died, we lost his income. I had to figure out how to raise our son, who was then 6. I sold my business on the Oregon coast, lost my house in Newport, and moved to Washington to be with my sister. I found Olympia a year later and have been here since. I have qualified for food stamps for the last 8 years. We have depended on the food bank on and off. When all this happened, that was before ObamaCare, and the $1,000 monthly premium for insurance for my family was simply not sustainable. At first, I was able to keep my insurance through COBRA. But after that ran out, we were left to paying for some cut rate insurance that provided very little coverage. When the Affordable Care Act was enacted, I finally felt relief. I got covered through the ACA, and that allowed me to direct some of the money I was paying to insurance toward food, books, clothing, or tuition. My son is now 13, and 6 foot 1, with a size 14 shoe, so we go through clothes and shoes for him like crazy. I still struggle. I still have medical bills and collections. I still struggle with food and clothes for both myself and my son. I still go to the Thurston County Food Bank in downtown Olympia. But ObamaCare allows me to follow my health closely and helps me pay for the medical care my son and I require. I have a spot on my lung that needs constant monitoring, and ObamaCare has allowed me to go in for those routine MRIs. Preventative services like mammograms are also paid for. Since my husband died, I have been focused on raising my son and getting a higher education degree. I went to massage school, and 
then I earned my degree at The Evergreen State College. I will graduate with a master’s degree in psychology in August. Not only will I be employable and be able to help others in the mental health field, I will also get to start whittling away at paying old medical bills and my student loans. Although I will no longer need ObamaCare since I will have health insurance through my employer, the ACA has forever changed the insurance marketplace. The insurers can’t charge me more for my preexisting condition like they could before. If the ACA had been in place when my husband died, I would have been able to keep my business on the Oregon coast. If the ACA had been in place when my husband died, I would have immediately qualified for insurance under the ACA, and I may have been able to keep our house. I want you to know, I am not lazy. I am a determined, selfimproving mom who is raising her son alone. Before the ACA, I had to decide whether to pay for insurance or food. I depend on the ACA. 
That is the letter from Sherry. Madam Speaker, this past Saturday, I had the opportunity to meet with more than 300 of my constituents who support accessible, affordable health care in our country. I heard from many, but still a small portion of the 750,000 Washingtonians who gained coverage through the ACA. The ACA is working for many people across America, and Congress should not reverse the progress we have made under it. That being said, I know there are parts of the ACA that could be improved upon. We all know that. We can and should make improvements in order to make healthcare insurance more affordable and more accessible to more people across our Nation. As we began this Congress, I had hope that we could have a productive, bipartisan discussion about the steps we could take to do just that, but I was saddened and, frankly, dismayed by the lack of serious policy efforts from my friends on the other side of the aisle. Well, the majority finally released their proposed replacement for the ACA, the socalled American Health Care Act, after weeks of hiding this secret bill behind closed doors. Frankly, I am not impressed by the bill. This bill offers no attempts to improve healthcare coverage or insurance coverage, no attempts to reduce healthcare costs or the rate of inflation. This bill allows insurance to charge older people more while, at the same time, reducing the subsidies for many of those very same people. The bill was presented without any indication of how it will affect our budget or how many people will be kicked off their insurance under this plan. This bill does not address the barriers that prevent working class and middle class people from accessing and securing health insurance. In fact, the bill would likely put health insurance out of reach for millions of Americans who are in the working and middle classes. Madam Speaker, to earn the label ‘‘American,’’ a bill had better be exceptional. The American Health Care Act is a lot of things, but exceptional is not one of them. People like Sherry are exceptional. Let’s put Sherry and people in her circumstances first. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We ask Your blessing upon us this day. During these days, the American people can see the difficulties of legislating for this great Nation of ours. Disagreements between and within parties emerge when important and sweeping laws are being considered. So also the push and pull of local, State, and national governmental interests and responsibilities can be seen to contribute to the enormity of our way of government. Be it health care or immigration, the wisdom of our Founders can perhaps be seen in their designing a governmental process that is difficult, resistant to hasty solutions, and demanding of those who engage. May the American people be patient with and supportive of this process, and may the Members of this House, especially, merit the trust of their constituents, those who voted for them and those who did not. And may all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. WOODALL led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have introduced their healthcare plan. The President said it would be better and more cost effective than the Affordable Care Act and it would offer insurance to everybody. Well, if you believe that, you believe the President has got a secret plan to defeat ISIS which he was going to give us within 30 days, that there were thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheering 9/11, and that President Obama was born in Kenya. It is not true. What the plan they have introduced is is something that will give the wealthy unbelievable tax breaks. The 400 wealthiest people in America will get tax breaks of $7 million apiece; and the Americans who earn $200,000 a year or less will get none of those breaks, but they will pay more for their insurance and get less for it. 
The fact is property taxes will go up as less and less people are covered by insurance and they go to emergency rooms for primary care; and as hospitals give more uncompensated care, they have to raise your insurance rates in public hospitals and raise your property taxes. The American Hospital Association has come out against this. The American Medical Association has come out against this. Next thing you know, the people living the lifestyles of the rich and famous at MaraLago will come out against it. 
PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Elizabeth Oddy returned from east Africa after spending 2
1⁄2years as a Peace Corps volunteer. Before returning home, she was examined by a Peace Corps physician. She was deemed healthy and okay to come back to America. Two days after coming home, Elizabeth went to her doctor for a regular checkup where she was diagnosed with a lifethreatening illness. She had stage I thyroid cancer. Her Peace Corps insurance ended the next day. Peace Corps volunteers often have severe health problems upon their return from abroad. Health issues that are a direct result of serving in the Peace Corps should be covered by the Peace Corps. Volunteers like Elizabeth are the spirit of humanitarian assistance. It is our responsibility to ensure they are properly cared for both at home and abroad. My bill, the Sam Farr Peace Corps Enhancement Act, improves health care for all current volunteers and returned Peace Corps volunteers that contract illnesses during their service. We must continue providing support for our American angels abroad. And that is just the way it is. 
AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply troubled and disappointed that Republicans have chosen to move forward with their plans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act rather than working in a bipartisan fashion to improve this landmark legislation. Republicans have had 7 years to work across the aisle to find solutions. Instead, they have chosen to ignore the ACA’s success in pursuit of their singleminded focus on gutting the law. They have voted over 60 times to repeal the ACA. Could not even one of those votes have been to try to improve it if they saw these shortcomings? Mr. Speaker, the ACA expanded healthcare access to over 100,000 Rhode Islanders and 20 million people nationwide who otherwise did not have health insurance. Unfortunately, the Republican proposal jeopardizes the comprehensive, affordable, quality coverage Americans received under the ACA. Mr. Speaker, the Republican plan will lead to higher costs and less accessible coverage, and it will strain, not strengthen, our healthcare system. Their plan disproportionately harms seniors, people with disabilities, and those who rely on Medicaid. I have long said, Mr. Speaker, that the ACA isn’t perfect, but it is an important first step toward fulfilling our Nation’s promise of compassion and opportunity because health care is a necessity. It is something that is a right, not a privilege. Unfortunately, the Republicans’ American Health Care Act will break this fundamental promise by undermining the healthcare coverage of millions. f 
AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT (Mr. WOODALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I rarely come down during the 1minute time of the day, and I am glad I came down this morning for Father Conroy’s prayer because there really is a lot of anxiety in this country as it relates to health care. Every family in this country has health care on their mind. The gentleman from Rhode Island is exactly right. We have an opportunity to work together to fix it because we all know the ObamaCare system is failing. That is why we talk about how to fix it because we know that it is failing. President Trump said on Monday that the Republican alternative is now open for review and negotiation. He didn’t say take it or leave it. He didn’t say pass it before you can read it. He said open for review and negotiation. I challenge my colleagues to think about our opportunity to serve not just one constituent, but all of our constituents. Think about our opportunity to come together and put this healthcare discord behind us for a generation. I thank Father Conroy for that admonition this morning. I hope we will rise to that challenge. 
EPA PUGET SOUND BUDGET CUTS (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose potential deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency. According to many recent press reports, the EPA budget to restore our critical Puget Sound in my home State of Washington is facing a 93 percent cut. What is worse is the EPA, overall, is potentially facing a 25 percent budget cut, resulting in a loss of 15,000 jobs. Let us be clear that the EPA is the entity that ensures clean air, clean water, and strong human health. Because of the EPA’s work on accountability and oversight of strong environmental regulations, we have seen progress on pollution mitigation, shoreline restoration, water treatment, and education projects that are aimed at protecting our sound and our environment. This administration’s cuts will be devastating to our environment. By signing an executive order to move forward on Keystone and the DAPL pipeline, appointing Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA, and rolling back environmental regulations, we are showing overt hostility to protecting our environment. We need to be investing in our environment and not slashing it, and we need to make sure that we restore our environment and preserve it for our future generations. f 
NORWICH BOYS BASKETBALL SECTION 4 CHAMPIONS (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to rise and recognize and congratulate the new Section 4, Class B boys’ basketball champions, the Norwich Purple Tornadoes. The hard work, dedication, and sportsmanship of these young men helped lead their team to claim the Section 4 victory for the second year in a row. In the game against the Waverly Wolverines, senior forward Chris Jeffrey scored 17 hardfought points, taking Norwich into the second half leading 18–17. In the final half, Norwich took the court by storm to claim the title of Section 4 champion with a final score of 49–35. On behalf of the 22nd District, congratulations to Norwich and Coach Brian Collier on an outstanding win. We wish you luck in the State quarterfinal on March 11 against the Section 3 champions. 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY AND A DAY WITHOUT A WOMAN (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of International Women’s Day and to join the countless women across this Nation in participating today and, yes, dressed in red to celebrate our achievements of women across the world in many fields. I stand with the women today to highlight the economic injustices women face: unequal pay, unpaid leave, gender discrimination, and the list 
goes on. Oh, yes, to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Women are the primary breadwinners. Six out of 10 American women are paid only 80 cents on the dollar, and for women of color like me, 64 cents. But today it is so important for us to say we are faced with the dangerous and irresponsible repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which will once again make being a female a preexisting condition and take away access to free preventative services like mammograms and cervical cancer screening. You should ask yourself: Why are they doing this markup without hearings? You should ask yourself: Why should families pay more? Why should those with disabilities and preexisting conditions pay more? Why should billionaires benefit more? Stand with us women on International Women’s Day. 
b1215 INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to join so many of my women Members of Congress to recognize and celebrate International Women’s Day. In my lifetime, women have made so much progress, but our journey toward full equality still has so far to go. More than five decades ago, a half a century, we began the work to achieve equality in the workplace when President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act. We took another important step forward when President Obama signed his first bill into law, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Even with those laws, women in my congressional district still only make 72 cents on a man’s dollar. For women of color, the wage gap is even worse, 63 cents for AfricanAmerican women and 54 cents for Latinas. When you consider that women make up almost half of the workforce, and women are either the sole or primary breadwinner in 40 percent of the homes, this isn’t just a women’s issue; it is a family issue. This is why we must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to give every woman additional tools to fight for equal pay they earn on each and every payday. In a country as great as ours, we must guarantee that our daughters have the same opportunity to earn a fair and equal wage. 
STEPHANIE CHANEY AND THE ACA (Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, well, here we are, on International Women’s Day, 7 years from when we started the Affordable Care Act, 60 votes to repeal behind us, and yet only this week we have had the big reveal of what the plan will be for replacement. What are we seeing? We don’t have any cost information, but we know we are going to protect wealthy insurance executives, and we know that an estimated 15 to 20 million Americans will have their health insurance ripped away from them. Let me introduce you to one who is concerned about her ongoing coverage. Her name is Stephanie Chaney, and she is from my district in Framingham, Massachusetts. She is a recent grad student at Lesley University, where she studied to be a clinical counselor and dance therapist. She was diagnosed with a rare and extremely painful joint disease, and because of the ACA, she got the treatment she needed. Because she was a student and not employed, the healthcare law and the changes we make are going to have a direct impact on her life. She worries that if she cannot find another affordable plan, she will have to start over again. Let’s think of her and do the right thing by Americans with their health care. f 
DEFENSE SPENDING IS IMPORTANT (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Armed Services, I rise to voice my full support for the fiscal year 2017 Defense Appropriations bill. This legislation supports our Armed Forces by helping pay our troops and provide care for our men and women in uniform and their families, and it gives our military the resources necessary to combat terrorism, deter our adversaries, and support our allies. The Defense Appropriations bill includes a 2.1 percent pay raise for our servicemen and women, which will help our military families like those who are currently struggling in Nevada to make ends meet. One of the most important investments proposed is increasing our military readiness, which helps strengthen our national security. The legislation fully funds troop number increases authorized and provides an additional $6.8 billion in procurement spending. This is especially important for helping modernize our Armed Forces by fulfilling unmet requirements for additional ships, weapons, and aircraft, such as the F–35 Joint Strike Fighters at Nellis Air Force Base and unmanned aerial vehicles flying counterISIL operations missions from Creech Air Force Base. Finally, the NDAA helps support programs that strengthen relations with our allies. I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation. 
TODAY WE RAISE OUR VOICES (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today is International Women’s Day, a day without women. I am going to join millions of women in recognizing the important economic power of women in the United States and around the globe. In a few minutes, I will exit this Chamber with colleagues to show solidarity with our sisters, who are staying away from normal duties and mainstream commerce to call attention to the inequities that women and gender nonconforming people continue to face. We are wearing red to signify our love for our sisterhood and our passionate energy to pursue measures that will advance the lives of women and families, such as equal pay, paid family leave, quality affordable child care, access to Federal health care, and freedom from violence. In Congress, Democrats will resist efforts to take us back from hardearned gains, standing strong against the unrelenting attempts by Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, defund Planned Parenthood, and block access to full reproductive care. In the words of the Women’s March, today we raise our voices to say that women’s rights are human rights, regardless of a woman’s race, ethnicity, religion, immigration status, and so forth. When women succeed, the world succeeds. f 
OPPOSING REPEAL OF THE ACA (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the plan to repeal the ACA. A recent analysis of this plan concludes that 10 million people would lose their health insurance. That is mainly due to the fact that the plan would stop Medicaid expansion and shorten the Medicare trust fund. Many people in my district would be affected by this plan. 68,000 of my constituents are covered by the Medicaid expansion, 23,000 constituents receive assistance to afford health insurance through the exchange. If the ACA is repealed and the new plan implemented, thousands of my constituents, my neighbors, and my friends would lose their coverage. But don’t just take my word for it or my constituents’ word for it. Let’s ask the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to look at the plan carefully and to give a report as to who and how many people it will affect. If you are going to take on something that affects so many Americans, then America deserves to know how our health care and our lives will be impacted by your plan. 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY STRIKE (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of International Women’s Day, A Day Without a Woman strike. Today we are here and are joined by many of our sisters around the Nation to declare, once and for all, that women’s rights are human rights. We are here to stand in solidarity with women across the country to send a clear message: We will not rest until we create a society where all women— all women—have equal rights under the law. We are resisting and letting President Trump and the Republicans know that we will not go back. We stand with the millions around the Nation who have walked out today, and today we are walking out for them. We are raising our voices for the millions of women who can’t because they might get fired or because they can’t afford to lose their meager wages. I encourage all of my Democratic colleagues to join us, along with Leader PELOSI , the Democratic Women’s Working Group, Congresswoman KATHERINE CLARK , and so many others, for a walkout following these 1 minutes and attend the press conference on the House steps right outside in solidarity and in honor of all of the women in the world who are marching today and striking today for equal rights. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HILL). The gentlewoman from Wyoming is recognized for 1 hour. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Wyoming? There was no objection. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 174, which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 1301, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal 2017. I would like to thank, in particular, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , Chairman GRANGER , and Ranking Member V ISCLOSKY for their hard and dedicated work on this bill. Mr. Speaker, we have no higher obligation as elected representatives of the people of this great Republic than ensuring for the security and defense of our Nation. We are gathered here at a tremendous time of action and achievement across an array of crucial policy areas, regulatory relief for the citizens and businesses of our Nation, restoration of authority to our States and local communities, tax reform, ObamaCare repeal and replacement, and the list goes on. President Trump is doing what he promised during his campaign, and it is an honor to serve the people of Wyoming at this historic moment. But, Mr. Speaker, it is no exaggeration to say that if we fail to provide the resources our military needs to defend our Nation, if we fail to do what is necessary to ensure America’s Armed Forces remain superior to all others in the world, if we fail to provide the support our men and women in uniform need to recover from 8 years of devastating policies, nothing else we are doing in this body will matter. Mr. Speaker, the need is urgent. As we meet today to debate the 2017 Defense appropriation, our Nation faces a more complex and grave threat environment than we have faced at anytime since World War II, and possibly, Mr. Speaker, more than at anytime in our history. For 8 years, our adversaries’ strength has grown, while our relative capabilities have stagnated and, in some instances, declined. b1230 North Korea continues its ballistic missile launches as it threatens our allies and interests. The Iranian nuclear agreement has bought time for Iran to continue to advance its nuclear weapons program, as it reaps the windfall of at least $1 trillion of U.S. taxpayer funds provided to it by the Obama administration. Iran continues to threaten U.S. naval vessels in the Strait of Hormuz, support terrorism across the Middle East, and test ballistic missiles despite its U.N. obligations. China is rapidly building up its military, and it is targeting, in particular, technologies to try to level the playing field with our capabilities. It continues to threaten freedom of navigation and trade in the South China Sea, and to conduct cyber operations against the United States. Russia has invaded Ukraine, threatens Eastern Europe and the Baltics, is violating INF Treaty obligations, and openly threatening the use of nuclear weapons. AlQaida today exists in more counties than ever before, and ISIS continues to recruit and hold territory as it plans and launches attacks against the West. Most of the actors I just mentioned are also responsible for cyber attacks against the United States. Against this backdrop, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. military is vastly under resourced. At a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing, the vice chief of staff of the Army told members that of the 58 brigade combat teams, only three are ready to ‘‘fight tonight.’’ The vice chief of naval operations, Admiral William Moran, recently testified that more than half of all Navy aircraft are grounded due to maintenance issues and an inability to acquire the necessary parts. Our nuclear force is aging, even as our adversaries continue to make advancements in their own nuclear forces and capabilities. Our Air Force is the oldest, smallest, and least ready it has ever been. 
These stories and shortfalls, Mr. Speaker, exist across nearly every aspect of our military. America’s fighting men and women are the greatest fighting force and the greatest force for good our world has ever known. They deserve the resources to do their job. We have prevailed over great challenges in the past, from our unlikely and miraculous founding, through our Civil War, two world wars, the Cold War, and the early years of the war on terror. We must, Mr. Speaker, marshal our forces to do so again. To prevail, Congress—this Congress—must do its job. That job begins with passing this 2017 Defense Appropriations bill. Then, Mr. Speaker, we must repeal the Budget Control Act and end sequestration. There is a rational and responsible way for us to undertake defense budgeting. The process in place today is neither. The last time our military was able to assess the threats we face and then recommend the necessary funding levels to defeat those threats was fiscal year 2011, over 6 years ago. We must return to this standard budgeting process. In describing the effects of sequestration several years ago, our current Defense Secretary put it this way: ‘‘No foe in the field can wreak such havoc on our security as mindless sequestration is achieving today.’’ We must end this practice with all speed. This should not be a partisan issue, Mr. Speaker. It has not been in our past. Since World War II, every American President, Republican and Democrat alike, has understood the importance of American military superiority of ensuring a world in which America and our allies set the rules. Threatened by the Nazis and the Japanese, Franklin Roosevelt and George C. Marshall knew America had to be the ‘‘arsenal of democracy.’’ At the beginning of the Cold War, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy roused the Nation to defeat freedom and liberty against communism. John F. Kennedy knew America had to be ‘‘the watchmen on the walls of freedom.’’ In the 1980s, President Reagan oversaw the defense buildup we are still benefiting from today. He knew that ‘‘war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, it is when they are weak that tyrants are tempted.’’ And in the aftermath of 9/11, it was George Bush and Dick Cheney who kept us safe, who knew we could not win this war on defense, who understood we had to have a military strong and capable enough to deny terrorists the safe havens from which they plot and plan and launch attacks against our fellow citizens. Mr. Speaker, now it is our turn. Across the globe, our adversaries challenge us, from China to North Korea, to Iran, to Russia; across the Middle East, in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Thirtyfour years ago, Ronald Reagan described our duty at another time, against another enemy, this way: 
It is up to us in our time to choose, and choose wisely, between the hard but necessary task of preserving peace and freedom, and the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly hope for the best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger day by day. Mr. Speaker, we can no longer ignore our duty while our enemies grow stronger. We must take the first step today to begin rebuilding our military. H.R. 1301 is that first step. It increases defense spending, provides a full pay raise for our servicemen and women, and begins to address our readiness shortfalls. This bill provides funds based on our military’s priorities for fiscal year 2017 and gets us off the cycle of continuing resolutions, which are doing real damage to our readiness and capacity. Therefore, I urge support for the rule to allow for consideration of H.R. 1301, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ) for the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to Defense Subcommittee Chairmen GRANGER and F RELING HUYSEN , and Ranking Member V ISCLOSKY , for their hard work in bringing this bill to the House floor today. The Defense Subcommittee is known for its ability to work in a bipartisan manner, and this bill demonstrates that this tradition continues. Last year, the House approved its version of the FY 2017 Defense Appropriations bill. It was a deeply flawed bill filled with funding gimmicks, including a funding cliff that cut off funding for the war budget in order to boost base defense spending by $18 billion. The Senate version of the Defense Appropriations bill did not contain such gimmicks and was marked up by the Senate Defense Subcommittee, the full committee, and reported out of the Senate Appropriations Committee, but it never went to the Senate floor for consideration. The FY 2017 Defense Appropriations bill that the House will consider later today is not, therefore, a conference report. It is being treated as if it were a conference report, namely by having a closed rule, but let us be perfectly clear that this is not a conference report. Let me also be clear, Mr. Speaker, that we could have had this type of final bill come before us last December, just as we could have brought up all of the pending FY 2017 appropriations bills before the House last December for final action. Instead, Republican leadership chose to keep nearly the entire Federal Government, including the Pentagon, operating at FY 2016 levels without any clarity about what their annual budgets might be. So when we hear talk about problems with military readiness or shortfalls in defense budgets, I suggest the Republican leadership hold a mirror up to their faces and take some responsibility. This bill is 5 months late. It could also have been taken care of 3 months ago in December, and, in fact, it should have been taken care of in December. It is now making its way through another convoluted process today. But we still have no idea about the fate of the other pending ten appropriations bills that the Republican leadership failed to complete last December. And I say convoluted, Mr. Speaker, because when the House votes on H.R. 1301 today, it still needs to go back to the Senate, and we really have no idea what they are going to do with it. Are they going to pass it without any changes and send it to the President for signature? Or are they going to use it as a vehicle to attach the other ten appropriations bills and send it back to us as the FY 2017 omnibus that we should have completed in December? Perhaps they might consider holding on to it until the President gets around to sending Congress his request for the FY 2017 supplemental so that we finally know how much Congress is actually being asked to approve for Pentagon spending in FY 2017? So hold on to your hats because we are not done today with the defense spending bills for fiscal year 2017, one way or the other. Mr. Speaker, I know that everyone in this House wants to make sure that our men and women in uniform are well staffed, trained, and equipped to carry out the missions and duties that we have asked them to carry out. In these areas, in particular, there is much to recommend in this latest version of the FY 2017 defense bill. The same is true for the funding included in H.R. 1301 for suicide prevention, sexual assault, and medical research. I would also like to point out that H.R. 1301 totals $577.9 billion. This includes $516.1 billion in the base bill and $61.8 billion in the overseas contingency operations account to fund the many wars in which we are engaged. Coupled with the $5.8 billion FY 2017 supplemental Congress approved last year, total defense spending for FY 2017 currently stands at $583.7 billion; and that is before we receive still another FY 2017 supplemental from the President. Mr. Speaker, that is well over half a trillion dollars for the Pentagon, more than the combined total military spending of the next seven greatest military powers in the world. So for those who bemoan how underfunded the Pentagon is, I would argue it is more a matter of failing to set priorities and tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. Every report on every attempted audit of the Defense Department reveals that the Pentagon doesn’t have a clue about where the money goes. Billions and billions of dollars cannot be accounted for. No other agency in the U.S. Government gets so much money or is allowed such sloppy 
accounting, yet the White House and the Congress can’t wait to throw even more billions at the Pentagon, rather than demanding accountability and setting clear spending priorities. There are also other matters of concern with this bill, Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1301 not only continues, but adds to the prohibitions regarding the detention facility at Guantanamo. This is all an effort to prevent Guantanamo from shutting down, which hurts America’s ability to do human rights work around the world and remains a stain on our own values and ideals. This bill continues to spend billions of dollars on the insane trilliondollar effort to modernize and produce new generations of nuclear weapons when what we should be doing is continuing to reduce our nuclear arsenal and enter hard negotiations with other nations that have nuclear weapons to eliminate them altogether. Finally, H.R. 1301 continues to provide socalled emergency funding through the OCO account to continue wars in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. These wars are hardly unexpected or an emergency and should, therefore, be fully incorporated into the base budget for the Pentagon. They are also wars for which Congress has not debated or approved any authorization for the use of military force. We do not have an AUMF to deploy our military forces against the Islamic State, yet we have deployed military forces in the air, at sea, and on the ground in Iraq, in Syria, and elsewhere in the region. We do not have an AUMF to deploy our military forces in the civil war in Yemen, yet we have deployed them to Yemen where one of our Navy SEALs was killed in combat and several others wounded in January. The Republican leadership continues to fail at its constitutional responsibilities by not bringing any AUMF before the House for consideration, despite promises to do so. So here we are in the 115th Congress, following in the failed footsteps of the 113th and 114th Congresses, getting ready to vote on tens of billions of dollars for wars that Congress has failed to authorize. I am proud of the courage demonstrated every single day by our men and women in uniform. I wish I could say the same thing about Congress and this House. Finally, Mr. Speaker, while I am glad that at least one of the pending appropriations bills is going to see some action today, I wonder about the fate of the other ten. When will we see those bills, Mr. Speaker? In fact, speaking of urgent pending matters, when will we see a jobs bill? b1245 When are we going to see legislation to repair and modernize America’s infrastructure? Will extra funds be included in the fiscal year 2017 Transportation—HUD Appropriations bill, in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, in the Interior Appropriations bill for similar improvements on Federal lands? We have all read about the replacement proposed by the Republican leadership for the Affordable Care Act, and correct me if I’m wrong, Mr. Speaker, but I am having trouble remembering how many hearings were held on that proposal so that Congress could benefit from experts in the healthcare field about whether this replacement bill will provide health care to even more Americans at less cost than the ACA. Oh, that is right, Mr. Speaker. The proposal is being marked up today without any hearings or expert testimony whatsoever. Especially for the new Members of this body, it is important to remember that, when the Democrats drafted the Affordable Care Act, there were dozens of hearings and 30 days prenotification before Energy and Commerce held its markup, a markup that continued over many days. And then the bill, as reported out of committee, was posted for over 2 months online before coming before the full House for debate on amendments and final passage. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, if a replacement bill to the ACA is not able to make sure that more Americans have health insurance at a lower cost, then what is the point other than politics? We don’t need to see any bill that covers fewer people and forces workers, families, and individuals to pay even more for their healthcare coverage and get even less in terms of healthcare protections. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Republican replacement bill is being marked up in committee without a score by the Congressional Budget Office; and without a CBO score, then no one in this Chamber, in this city, in this Nation has any idea, has any clue how much this replacement bill will cost the taxpayer, let alone who will benefit and who will suffer under its provisions. That is simply a scandal, Mr. Speaker, completely unacceptable. It is a cruel joke on American families, American workers, and the States, local communities, hospitals, doctors, nurses, and healthcare providers who will have to struggle with the consequences of people losing their health insurance. Mr. Speaker, let’s see America’s priorities taken care of: a jobs bill, an infrastructure bill. Let’s make sure we don’t weaken healthcare protections for people in this country, and let’s see all of the FY 2017 appropriations bills come before the House in the next few days so that we can complete the work that should have been done last December. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the vice chairman of the Rules Committee. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and, frankly, I want to thank her for taking on this rule and the role she plays in this House. She came to Congress with an extraordinary expertise in national security, probably unsurpassed by any new Member. So she is not only a valuable member of the Rules Committee, she is an important voice for the security of the United States of America in a very dangerous era. Before I begin, I want to actually agree with my friend from Massachusetts on a couple of very important points that he made. First, I want to agree with him that this should have been done earlier. My friend is exactly right about this. This could have been done, in my view, in November and December. We should have gotten it done then. We would have avoided a lot of problems that come with a continuing resolution. I am very pleased that we are moving it now, but earlier would have been better, no question about it. And that is true with every other bill, and my friend made that point as well. We really should make sure that each of the appropriations bills are passed. All of the problems associated with the continuing resolution are so evident for our military, are evident, frankly, in every other department. So I would hope my leadership continues to do what they are doing today and that is move these bills forward. My friend is also right, in my opinion, about the authorization of the use of military force. This is something we have agreed on, even when we disagree on other things. This is a congressional responsibility. The President has announced he is going to announce a new strategy going forward on ISIS. I would suggest to my side of the aisle and to the administration, now would be a great time to come to the Congress so we could have this robust debate on deploying and using our military and discharge our constitutional responsibilities. I am less persuaded by my friend’s arguments about the spending levels here. I just point out for the record this is well below what former Secretary of Defense Gates, when he was Secretary in the Obama administration, recommended we should be doing at this time. Frankly, that is because the last administration dropped the ball and simply didn’t listen to its own experts as to what the appropriate level of our forces should be. The underlying legislation here is an excellent bill. My friends have already talked about it in detail. I am going to take a 30,000foot look at the bill and remind our listeners and our colleagues, there are three important objectives that this bill achieves: The first is stopping the erosion in end strength, something that went on for years under the last administration that somehow thought we would be safer if our military got smaller. That was a bad assumption. 
The second is to restart the procurement cycle. We have fallen far, far behind what we should be doing in terms of replacing, upgrading, and improving the weapons systems and the communication systems, every system that we move into war with and that we ask our men and women to use. And finally, this actually begins to address a problem that my friend from Wyoming discussed in great detail: readiness. We simply are not ready now to fight with the effectiveness. Now, I don’t have any doubt, if we had to deploy massively, that our forces would do well and they would win, but a lot of people would die because they hadn’t had the appropriate training, the appropriate time on task to get ready. The other great objective that this bill meets is that we finally match up spending with the authorization. Last year, we had an excellent authorization bill out of the House Armed Services Committee. Unfortunately, that doesn’t get you very far if the money doesn’t match the policies and the recommendations that they advanced. This now takes care of that problem. I also remind our colleagues that passing this bill is only a first step. As my friend from Wyoming pointed out, we are going to need a supplemental later this year, just for this year. We are going to need a robust increase in the fiscal year 2018 authorization and appropriation, something that the President has committed to and something I hope we can advance on a bipartisan basis. Finally, again, as my friend pointed out, real military buildups take years, not months and weeks. We are going to have to be at this task for several years to restore and strengthen, frankly, what we allowed to decline, what the last administration allowed to decline over several years. So this is an extraordinary first step, but it is only a first step; and I would hope my colleagues would join us on a bipartisan basis, while we have differences, but come together and put the defense of the country in a very dangerous time ahead of all else that we do. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill and the underlying legislation, and I urge the passage of the rule. Again, I want to thank my friend from Wyoming. I want to thank my friend from Massachusetts. We sometimes disagree, but he makes very valuable and very important points in some of the critiques he offers, and I hope that we heed them well. With that, again, Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of the underlying legislation and the adoption of the rule. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his kind words and for understanding that it is inappropriate for Congress to continue these wars without having a vote on an AUMF. I hope that that changes, but I appreciate his support, and there is bipartisan support for having this body actually do its job. That shouldn’t be a radical idea, but, unfortunately, nowadays, doing our job seems to be something that a lot of people don’t want to do. Mr. Speaker, at the very beginning of the year, the Republican majority adopted a rule to explicitly exempt the cost of any bill that repeals or amends the Affordable Care Act from a requirement that it not increase spending by $5 billion. They effectively adopted a legislative blindfold to completely ignore the cost of repeal. Let me show you the poster of the language, and I am happy to provide this to my colleagues on the Republican side. I will even give you my bifocals if you want to read it, because I think it is important that people understand what it says. It says: Point of order: It shall not be in order to consider any bill that would cause a net increase in direct spending in excess of $5 billion. Limitation: This subsection shall not apply to any bill repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 
Mr. Speaker, as you can see, with this act, the majority declared that they were not going to let the rules of this House, which are purportedly in place to ensure fiscal discipline, stand in the way of repealing the Affordable Care Act no matter how much it would cost American families. But, Mr. Speaker, it gets even worse. As we stand here today, Republicans have taken their headinthesand approach to the Affordable Care Act to a new low. Right now, both the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees are considering Republican legislation to repeal healthcare reform without providing any analysis from the nonpartisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office on the cost of their legislation. So let me put this another way. Earlier this year, the Republicans said: It does not matter how much it will cost to take health care away from millions of Americans. Now they are saying they don’t even want to know how much it will cost or what impact it will have on American families. Mr. Speaker, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office. That office costs nearly $50 million a year. We pay them to advise us precisely at times like this. Republicans have talked about repeal and replace for 7 years. Acting like they had not enough time to weigh the cost of their actions would be laughable if it were not so irresponsible. Now, we Democrats care about health care and we care about costs and we demand to know what the impact of this repeal bill will be. Members should not be asked to vote on this legislation until they know the full weight of their decision. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would require a CBO cost estimate to be made publicly available before any legislation that amends or repeals the Affordable Care Act may be considered in the Energy and Commerce or Ways and Means Committee or on the House floor. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of that amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ), who has been a leader on this issue, and he will explain this even further. Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding time. The issue before us is far more basic than one’s view on the Affordable Care Act. I recognize that there is a philosophical difference about the Affordable Care Act: on our side of the aisle, we think it is good legislation; on the opposite side of the aisle, they have concerns. But the issue is whether the American people, whether taxpayers, ought to know the cost of the repeal legislation, whether they have the right to know how much a legislation introduced in this House costs. Now, here is the irony: the Speaker of the House, the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin, made his entire career demanding that we know numbers behind legislation. That was his mantra in his time of service in the House. You talk to Doug Elmendorf, who was the former Congressional Budget Office Director, and he said that the one thing he respected about the Speaker is that he would actually insist on the numbers, that he would want to know how much we are adding to a $20 trillion deficit. That is why it is incomprehensible to me that, in this Congress, under this Speaker, we would ever be asked to vote on legislation without knowing the financial impact of that legislation. These are basic issues: How much is the repeal legislation going to add to our deficit? How much is it going to finance tax cuts for the wealthy? How many people will it leave out of insurance or how many people would it add to insurance? There just ought to be a transparent discussion. Now, it is not just Democrats who want this transparent discussion; actually, a Republican, the gentleman from Ohio, a founder of the Freedom Caucus, has expressed similar concerns. He has expressed concerns that this repeal legislation will balloon the deficit and explode the deficit, and he wants to know the numbers. We can have as much respectful disagreement about how to cover people and whether the Affordable Care Act is 
a good piece of legislation or not, but what we should not be debating is the public’s right to transparency. That is why I urge my colleagues to reject the previous question so that we can hold an immediate vote on requiring the Congressional Budget Office to score the repeal legislation and provide the American people with the basic financial costs of the legislation. b1300 Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. What is incomprehensible to me is that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem so fundamentally confused about what the actual issue before us today is. The issue before us today is whether or not this House is going to undertake its fundamental, most important, most sacred obligation under our Constitution and provide for the defense of this Nation. Now, they can choose to dedicate their time to another very important topic. It is a hugely important topic and one that we will have many days to debate and discuss on this floor. Unlike under the previous leadership, Speaker PELOSI , our leadership, Speaker RYAN, has not told us we have to pass the bill before we know what is in it. Today, the issue before us in this House is whether or not we are going to provide for the defense of this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ). Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful that our colleagues across the aisle have become so interested in the impact of the national debt on the American people. I only wish that, during their time in control of the White House, we had not doubled the national debt. I am similarly grateful that Members on the other side of the aisle would say that we should know the impact of legislation before we vote for it because, after all, it was former Speaker PELOSI  who said: Let’s vote for it so that we know what is in the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because following an 8year cycle of abandonment, it is time we do right by our military members and their families. I rise in support of the brave warriors stationed at Eglin Air Force Base, Naval Air Station Pensacola, and all across the globe. The 2.1 percent pay raise we provide in this appropriation is a modest downpayment on what is owed to those who put themselves in harm’s way for our freedom. Our current state of military readiness is not acceptable. Half of the planes in our Navy cannot fly. Pilots are leaving. Marines are harvesting parts out of museums. Soldiers downrange don’t have the unrivaled equipment they need to match their unrivaled patriotism. This $583 billion appropriation is a first step. It means 74 new F–35 aircraft. The F–35 is the most capable aircraft in the sky. Pilots have greater survivability in the F–35. This matters so much to me. In my district, we are training the next generation of F–35 pilots to fight and win against any enemy we encounter in the skies. This legislation also reflects our values by investing in cancer research and traumatic brain injury research. Now, some say we cannot focus on defense; we should focus on other domestic priorities. I would simply say our adversaries are not waiting. Our warfighters and military families are tired of waiting and so am I. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciated the gentleman from Florida’s comments, but I would just ask him: Why is the Republican leadership 5 months late in bringing a defense appropriations bill to the floor? We could have done this months ago. So if there was this urgency, it seems to escape the Republican leadership. I want to take issue with the gentlewoman from Wyoming when she says that what is important today and what we are debating today is only this Defense Appropriations bill. As you know, we are currently debating the rule, and the rule is a tool used to set the House agenda and to prioritize consideration of legislation. For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would like to prioritize, what is of grave concern to us, and what agenda we would like to pursue in this House. The fact of the matter is that, as we are speaking, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee are marking up TrumpCare, which we know, in all likelihood, is going to result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance. We also are concerned that it is going to cost the American taxpayer a boatload of money. What we are simply saying here today is that the Congressional Budget Office, which we fund and we rely on, ought to be able to give us a cost estimate, ought to tell us how much this is going to add to our deficit, how much it is going to cost the American people, how many people are going to lose their health care. Why in the world would you rush a major piece of legislation through committee and onto the floor without even knowing what you are talking about? I mean, this process constitutes mindless legislating. This is not doing your job, and that is all we are requesting. We can argue over whether or not you like the Affordable Care Act or you don’t. But whatever you are going to do, we ought to bring it to the floor with everybody’s eyes wide open and knowing what the impacts are going to be. Talk about lack of transparency, this TrumpCare bill was under lock and key until just a couple of days ago. It was the bestkept secret in the world. For 7 years, my friends have been talking about a replacement bill. No one ever saw it. But all of a sudden, it is brought out before the American people at a press conference and, again, in a way that doesn’t answer a lot of questions. It is being rushed through committee, and it is going to be rushed onto the House floor. That is not a good process. I will remind my colleagues that when the Affordable Care Act was considered here in the House, the House held 79 bipartisan hearings and markups on the health insurance reform in 2009 and 2010. You have held no hearings. None. There has been no expert testimony, no healthcare professionals, no doctors, no patients, no nurses, no families, nothing. There have been no hearings. The bill went right to markup. House Members spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, considered 239 amendments, both Democratic and Republican, accepted 21 amendments. Again, there have been no hearings. In markup, the Energy and Commerce Committee adopted 24 GOP amendments. In markup, the Education and the Workforce Committee adopted six GOP amendments. The original House bill was posted online for 30 days before the first committee began their markup and more than 100 days before the tricommittees formally introduced their merged bill in the House. House Democrats posted their first House bill online for the promised 72 hour review. The Senate bill voted on in the House was online for 3 months, and the reconciliation bill was online for 72 hours of review before the final vote. House Democrats heard and answered questions from constituents at more than 3,000 healthcare townhalls and public events. Tens of thousands of emails, calls, and letters were logged in congressional offices to register public comment. My friends are busy trying to avoid public town meetings. I am just simply saying that we are raising this issue because we are deeply concerned about the prospect of millions of Americans losing health care and about you adding God knows what to our deficit. I don’t think it is too much to come together in a bipartisan way to say: Let us know what the costs are going to be, let us know what the impacts are going to be. And if you still want to vote for TrumpCare, you can vote for it, but you ought to know what you are voting for. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would say that not knowing what they are talking about is something with which our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are quite familiar. Accounts of public input really bear little 
relationship to what actually happened when ObamaCare itself was drafted in the dark of night. Imagine what it must be like if you are tuning in to this conversation and this discussion thinking that the U.S. House of Representatives is taking up the rule to debate, discuss, and pass our FY17 Defense Appropriations. Instead, what we are hearing is a list of when bills were posted online—a list— which, as I said, bears little reality to what actually happened when ObamaCare was passed. Now, those are hugely important issues. I am incredibly proud of the job we are doing as Republicans in this body to help save a collapsing healthcare system. Mr. Speaker, I think there is no higher duty and obligation we have than to ensure that our military is second to none. No matter what kind of a job we do, as important as that is to repeal and replace ObamaCare, if we fail to address this fundamental issue and fail to provide the resources our military needs, nothing else we do in this body matters. I believe, frankly, that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle owe our men and women in uniform, they owe the policymakers at the Pentagon, they owe those people who are serving this Nation the respect of talking about the resources they need to do their job and focusing on the true issue before us today. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for H.R. 1301, which will fund our national defense for fiscal year 2017. This bill is a vital first step as we begin to work on rebuilding our military. The best way to look at defense spending over time is as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product. Since World War II, we have spent an average of 5 percent of our GDP on defense during peacetime. Despite a world that has gotten more dangerous, the defense drawdown in recent years cut defense spending from 5 percent of GDP to 3 percent of GDP. And in a $17 trillion economy, that is real money. Meanwhile, since Vietnam, we have spent an average of 21 percent of the Federal budget on defense. Today, we spend well below that, about 15 percent of the overall budget. Things are so bad today—and I don’t have time in 2 minutes to go into all the details—that we are actually at risk of losing more American lives than we should in the event of another war. The next step is to pass a robust defense supplemental and then to fund defense for fiscal year 2018 at a minimum level of $640 billion. Anything less will not keep Americans safe and will not allow us to rebuild our military as we desperately must do. Congress must deal with sequestration. Trying to fund defense at BCA levels is like trying to put a size 10 foot into a size 7 shoe. It simply doesn’t work and it is dangerous for our own security and it is dangerous for the world. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to say to my colleagues on the other side: I know you don’t like me talking about health care. If I were you, I wouldn’t want to talk about health care either. This is a serious matter, and it is a matter of security for millions and millions of Americans in our country. Again, maybe somebody over there can tell me: How much is this new TrumpCare bill going to cost? How much is it going to add to the deficit? How much are the American taxpayers going to have to pay for it? Does anyone know how many people will lose their coverage? Hello? I guess I would ask the questions: Why do we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office, who we pay $50 million a year to be able to give us these estimates, if we are not going to utilize them? Why are we doing this? It seems to me that before we do something that could harm millions of people in this country, before we could do something that could result in an increase in our deficit, why don’t we ask the experts? And we all acknowledge that they are experts and we pay them lots of money. Why don’t we get their advice? This whole process seems backwards. You ought not to be marking up bills when you don’t know what their impact is going to be. Part of our job as Members of Congress, in addition to holding hearings and listening to experts and listening to citizens tell us their perspective— which, again, has been totally ignored in this process of the repeal of the healthcare bill—is also to make sure that when we are voting, we know what the impact is going to be, we know whether or not it is going to have a positive impact or whether it is going to have a negative impact. Again, one of the reasons why I want to defeat the previous question is so that we can vote in a, hopefully, bipartisan way to get a CBO score so we know what is what. I get it. I know my colleagues don’t want to talk about health care. They would rather talk about something we should have done months ago. That is what we are doing now, we are doing old work now. This should have been done 4 or 5 months ago. I am just baffled why you don’t want to do your job. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We on this side of the aisle are more than happy to talk about health care. We are more than happy to talk about the really crucial work that is underway to rescue our healthcare system from the collapse and the train wreck of ObamaCare, which my colleague’s party put into place in the dark of night with no reading of the bill. We are thrilled actually that our bill is 120 pages and that it is readable and that it is available online right now. So when he leaves the floor, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Massachusetts can go read the bill. It is also not surprising that our colleagues do not want to talk about our national defense because the record of the last 8 years, the record of the last President is unparalleled in American history. The mess that we are having to clean up with respect to our healthcare system is matched perhaps only—and maybe even exceeded—by the damage that was done to our military and to our national security under the last administration. We think, on this side of the aisle, that it is crucially important that we do our job when the time is now to debate, discuss, and vote on this bill and address this topic. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. TAYLOR ). b1315 Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of the 2017 Defense Appropriations bill, a bill providing vital funding for the United States military and intelligence communities who continue to be engaged in responding, engaging, and destroying threats around the world. Mr. Speaker, I have the honor and the great responsibility of representing the largest concentration of Active Duty military and veterans of any congressional district in the Nation. Who are they? Fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters, soccer coaches, neighbors. Our district has thousands of the less than 1 percent of the Nation that has gone forth over and over to fight for us; the best among us, fighting the worst in the world. In our district, Mr. Speaker, we have the largest naval base in the world, NASA, SEAL teams, Marines, Army soldiers, Air Force Combat Command, coastguardsmen, Oceana Naval Master Jet Base, national guardsmen, and many, many more. Mr. Speaker, we are moving toward the smallest Army since World War II, the smallest Air Force ever, Navy ships not being properly maintained due to budget, Marine planes not combat ready. This is unacceptable. Our Nation requires a military, but our force is voluntary. We owe them more. We must take up this 2017 Defense Appropriations bill to help maintain a technological advantage. If we must send our men and women into harm’s way, let us always send these warfighters with an unfair advantage. This bill provides essential equipment, platforms, and upgrades. We must give our force and our industrial base predictability and stability, the right equipment, the right training, and the right military superiority. This bill not only supports the warfighters, but their families as well 
who, Mr. Speaker, are the very backbone of our forces and an integral part of the tremendous sacrifice that has taken place for our Nation. This bill provides important investments in traumatic brain injury, suicide prevention, sexual assault prevention, and much more. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WEBSTER of Florida). The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, this bill gives a welldeserved pay raise, enhances health care, and eases the burden our Nation demands on military families moving forward. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in support of this bill. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I surely want to make sure that we support our warfighters. My problem with the Defense bill is that we are spending so much money on things that I think are questionable. I would rather spend money on supporting our troops more than spending $1 trillion over the next 3 decades building more nuclear weapons. We have more nuclear weapons than any other country in the world, and we ought to be talking about limiting nuclear weapons and eliminating them altogether. I want to support our men and women who we put in harm’s way, but I want this Congress, I want Members of this House, to do their job. It doesn’t take any courage to sit back and have troops deployed all over the world, in harm’s way, and we don’t even take the time to actually debate an authorization for the use of military force. We are too afraid to talk about those issues. So when we talk about supporting our men and women in uniform, people ought to do a little bit of reflection on how we have not been doing our job. Again, I note my friends don’t want to talk about health care. My colleague actually said she would like to talk about health care more. Well, we should, because the fact of the matter is, as I said, as we are speaking here, the Republicans have unveiled this bill that has been in secret, that nobody has really had a chance to digest. No hearings. They want to talk about health care so much—no hearings, no expert testimony, no nothing. Right to markup; trying to rush it to the floor before we find out the true cost to the American people about what this TrumpCare bill is going to be all about; when they find out how many of them are going to lose their care; how it is going to cut Medicare; how senior citizens are going to see an increase in their healthcare costs; how average Americans are going to pay more for health care and get less protections; how people who are struggling in poverty are going to be out of luck because they are going to do away with the Medicaid guarantee to States. Health care ought to be a fundamental right in this country, and they are taking that right away, and they are doing it in a fashion so that CBO, again, 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office that Congress appropriates $50 million a year to support so they can do their expert work, they are doing this in a way so we are not even asking for their expert advice. What sense does that make? This is the rule. This is where we set our priorities about what our legislative agenda ought to be; and all I am simply saying is vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we can vote on an amendment so we can demand a CBO score in the healthcare bill. By the way, that doesn’t slow down the Defense Appropriations bill. It still goes forward. Nothing stops. So let’s do what is right. Let there be a little sunshine on this House of Representatives. There is a pattern that has developed under the Republican leadership where everything is closed. This bill that we are dealing with right now, closed rule. It is not a conference report, closed rule. We have had more closed rules in the first few months in this Congress than any Congress, I think, in history, and that is the pattern. No hearings, no discussion, just go right to markup. We don’t want to know how much it is going to cost. We don’t want to know how many people are going to be thrown off of health care. Let’s just rush something through. That is mindless legislating, and it has to stop. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER). Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, over the last 8 years, the United States has experienced a sharp rise in the number of military threats from foreign aggressors. Last month, Russia secretly deployed two batteries of new nuclear capable cruise missiles. North Korea testlaunched four ballistic missiles just this week, and China continues to bolster its military presence in the South China Sea, while going toward a naval fleet that may surpass 351 ships by 2020. Meanwhile, our own Navy is the smallest it has been in 99 years, satisfying only 40 percent of the demand from regional commanders. Fiftyfour percent of the Air Force’s major weapons systems now qualify for antique vehicle license plates in the State of Virginia. The Army, to quote the Vice Chief of Staff, is ‘‘outraged, outgunned, and outdated.’’ These are the bitter fruits of defense sequester; defense sequester which must be pulled out, root and branch. To quote Secretary Mattis: ‘‘No foe in the field can wreak such havoc on our security that mindless sequestration is achieving.’’ I agree with General Mattis. I agree that defense sequester is mindless. It is also dangerous. So today, while I speak in support of this rule and this bill, I applaud the Appropriations Committee for its critical work, and I urge my colleagues to support final passage. This is just the first step. We will not have fulfilled our first and foremost constitutional duty to keep the country safe until we have completely eliminated defense sequester and truly begun the process of restoring peace through strength. Einstein’s words are as true today as they were in 1931, when he said of America: ‘‘The part of passive spectator is unworthy of this country and is bound in the end to lead to disaster all around.’’ If we do not act now to rebuild and modernize our military, if we continue to play the role of passive spectator, not only will it lead to disaster, at some point we will no longer be worthy of global leadership. So to my colleague, I will say that this is our job. This is our most basic job. So let’s do what the American people sent us here to do to keep the country safe, restore peace through strength. That is doing our job. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ). Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and I appreciate the hard work of Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Chairman GRANGER on this very important bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the FY17 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, and I urge voting and adoption of this bill. I served 26 years in uniform, and I can say, firsthand, that continuing resolutions are bad for our troops. It is urgent that we pass this bill. One reason is that we are in a military readiness crisis like I have not seen in my lifetime. This bill provides over $215 billion for readiness, an increase of $5.2 billion above the FY16 enacted budget. This increase includes funding for flight time for our pilots, maintenance for our aircraft, and base operations, among other things. It also provides more than $6.8 billion for procurement of aircraft, ships, and helicopters for our troops. The bill fully funds the mighty A–10 Warthog, and it has continued funding for upgrades for this critical plane, extending its service life by starting the rewinging of the remaining 110 aircraft in the fleet. It also increases funding to maintain our asymmetric electronic warfare advantage, developed and tested at Fort Huachuca, in my district. Finally, it provides funding for important missile programs, from airto air missiles to missile defense. Our troops are counting on us. Let’s stop the bickering, and let’s pass this bill. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to again urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote to defeat the previous question so we can actually bring an amendment to the floor to demand CBO tell us how much the Republican healthcare bill is going to cost and what its impact is going to be on the American people. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you why I am worried. The AARP estimates that the Republican repeal bill could increase premium costs by $8,400 for a 64 yearold earning $15,000 a year, and it could put at risk the health care of millions of vulnerable Americans. Now, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office. That office costs nearly $50 million a year. We pay them to advise us precisely at times like this. We ought to rely on their information. We ought to ask for their guidance. Before marking up bills, before rushing bills to the floor that could adversely impact millions and millions of Americans that could break the bank in this country, we ought to find out what we are talking about. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. You can pass the Defense bill and you can also pass an amendment that tells us how much this Republican healthcare bill is going to cost. We ought to do both. So defeat the previous question so that we can bring this amendment to the floor. Let a little sunshine in on this process. Let the American people know what is going on here. I think that is the appropriate way to proceed. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 1301 is the first step we must take in rebuilding our military. It is only a first step. We must also repeal the Budget Control Act and end sequestration if we are going to truly address our shortfalls. We must return to a rational budgeting process at the Pentagon, where spending is based upon defending the defeating threats to this Nation, not arbitrary and devastating acrosstheboard cuts. Mr. Speaker, nearly 70 years ago, President Harry Truman addressed this body about the growing Soviet threat to Eastern Europe. He said: ‘‘There are times in world history when it is far wiser to act than to hesitate. There is some risk in action. There always is. But there is far more risk in failure to act.’’ President Truman continued: ‘‘We must be prepared to pay the price for peace or, assuredly, we shall pay the price for war.’’ Today, Mr. Speaker, I urge that we begin to pay the price for peace. I urge support for the rule and for the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
b1330 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 725, INNOCENT PARTY PROTECTION ACT Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 175 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ) pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. Current Federal court rules allow trial lawyers to engage in picking their preferred venue. In particular, trial lawyers are able to file suit against the defendant in one State while keeping their case in a different State’s court. When a lawsuit is filed against a defendant in another State, trial lawyers may also sue a defendant in the State where they want the trial to occur. This keeps the case in the lawyers’ preferred State court. Many times the target of the lawsuit is a large, national business. But if the only defendant in the case is an outof State business, then the case can be heard in Federal court. Because of this, the trial lawyer will then also sue an innocent local individual or a small business in order to keep the case before a local court. Usually, the case against the innocent local defendant is dropped once the case is safely back in State court, but it is dropped only after the innocent local defendant has spent time and money dealing with the lawsuit. This practice is wrong. This practice perverts our justice system and causes needless pain. Trial lawyers should not have the power to subject innocent local individuals and small businesses to costly and timeconsuming lawsuits just to rig the system. This kind of abuse of litigation is unjust and must be stopped. A wellrespected Federal appeals court judge, J. Harvie Wilkinson of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, has publicly supported Congress putting an end to this abuse. He has suggested that Congress provide judges greater leeway in making the proper decision on whether a case should be removed to Federal court. He has also suggested that Congress give Federal judges greater discretion to determine early on in a case whether a local party has been fraudulently sued. The Innocent Party Protection Act provides these exact changes. In 2014 Judge Wilkinson addressed these proposals and said: That is exactly the kind of approach to Federal jurisdiction reform that I like because it is targeted. And there is a problem with fraudulent jurisdiction law as it exists today, I think, and that is that you have to establish that the joinder of a nondiverse local defendant is totally ridiculous and that there is no possibility of ever recovering. 
That is very hard to do. So Judge Wilkinson went on: 
So I think making the fraudulent joinder law a little bit more realistic appeals to me because it seems to me the kind of intermediate step that addresses some real problems. 
The legislation that this rule makes in order is the solution to the problem that Judge Wilkinson identifies. The underlying legislation would protect innocent local defendants in two main ways. First, the Innocent Party Protection Act allows Federal judges more leeway when determining whether a defendant has been fraudulently joined to a lawsuit for the purpose of keeping the case out of Federal court. When a judge has a case before his or her court, the judge will have clear guidelines for determining whether the locality of a defendant can be disregarded in establishing whether the case will proceed in Federal or State court. However, this in no way infringes on our State court systems. The judge must conclude that the defendant will not face a liability under applicable State law. Once that conclusion is reached, the judge then may release the innocent defendant from the case. This provision keeps legal claims in Federal Court that properly belong there by allowing Federal judges to decide whether a local party is truly a legitimate defendant and not simply ensnared in a case for the sole purpose of keeping the case in a trial lawyer friendly State court. This is a fair and efficient solution to the problem. Secondly, the Innocent Party Protection Act establishes a uniform approach for evaluating whether a plaintiff has a goodfaith intention of seeking judgment against a local defendant. While the U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized the right of courts to consider whether a plaintiff has a good faith intention of seeking a judgment against a local defendant, the application of this principle has not been uniform. The Innocent Party Protection Act simply codifies this longstanding principle and permits Federal judges to limit a lawsuit to the appropriate defendant. Plaintiffs with legitimate claims against both a local and outofState defendant will be able to pursue their case in State court. However, if no legitimate claim exists, the outofState defendant will have the opportunity to have the case heard in a neutral forum. By codifying this principle, we effectively protect innocent individuals and small businesses from badfaith litigation. Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation is a fair solution to one type of frivolous litigation. I support this effort, and I thank Chairman GOODLATTE  and the Judiciary Committee for bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate a rule for a piece of legislation that will, in the final analysis, make it more difficult for hardworking Americans to stand up to corporate malfeasance; a piece of legislation that jettisons a history of legal precedent in the blink of an eye because, well, it helps keep the deep pockets of the ultrawealthy as deep as possible. I learned this law in law school in 1959, but it was in existence way before that time, and now my friends across the aisle are going to tell us that this legislation is needed because it will protect small businesses. This is a feint, folks. Small businesses—indeed all of us—have been and continue to be protected by the centuryold jurisprudential rule that the Republicans come here today to upend. In reality, all this bill will do is make it more difficult for regular folks across this country to bring lawsuits against massive corporations. I shudder to think what would have happened in the critically important asbestos case had this particular law been in effect; and there are many more. This bill will make it more expensive both in time and treasure for our fellow Americans to hold corporations responsible in the courtroom, a need all the more prevalent today as my friends across the aisle have been busy gutting regulations at a dizzying pace. Let me make it clear, after we finish, my colleague from Colorado and I are going to go back to the Rules Committee to discuss some more judicial reform. A lot of it is stuff that is going to harm little people in the courts and to cause them not to have access to the court system, as have many of the regulations that we have already disapproved. Let us be clear, the American people didn’t vote for dirty water, but that is what they got with this Republican majority when it voted to repeal a rule that barred corporations from dumping mining debris into our drinking water, helping powerful mining companies by hurting all of the rest of the people in their near curtilage. The American people didn’t vote to weaken the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that is what this majority did when it passed a bill adding more hurdles to the SEC rulemaking process, making it more difficult for the agency to protect consumers, helping Wall Street while putting our economy at risk. I will make a prediction 
here. It may not happen right away, but just like we saw the Great Depression that we are just coming out of, we are likely to see that same kind of situation again by virtue of lessening the rules against violations in securities. The American people didn’t vote to drug test Americans on unemployment insurance—degrading the hardworking men and women in this country—but that is what this Republican majority did without delay. Mr. Speaker, the list really does go on and on. In fact, just yesterday, Republicans continued to chant the corporate clarion call with the unveiling of what I now will call their shameful replacement of the Affordable Care Act. Until there is a resolution, I am going to call it TrumpCare. My colleagues like to tout how short the bill is compared to the Affordable Care Act. Well, the American people will be surprised to find that, in that brevity, Republicans managed to repeal an Affordable Care Act provision that placed a limit on insurance executives’ compensation. Let me repeat that. They managed to repeal a provision that placed a limit on insurance executives’ compensation. The insurance executives shouldn’t be too surprised by this, however. Repeatedly, Republicans have shown they represent corporate interests over the interests of the American people. But my Republican colleagues didn’t stop there. Their socalled replacement, the Trump bill, also claims to have done away with the individual mandate. What they don’t tell you is that, instead, their plan calls for funneling money to the insurance companies in the form of a 30 percent surcharge if an individual goes without health insurance. Let me tell all the older Americans and 80yearold people like me to get ready because they are going to be able to charge you just exactly what they want to charge you, and all—mine and yours—insurance is going to go up if this particular measure were to become law. That is right. Under the Republican healthcare proposal, if you, the American worker, goes without healthcare coverage for longer than 2 months—say you couldn’t after a new plan between jobs—then Republicans give insurance companies the right to charge you 30 percent higher premiums. That is ridiculous. Republicans didn’t get rid of the individual mandate. They just turned the mandate into a windfall for insurance companies—a windfall that is going to work out great for insurance executives now that Republicans also removed the cap on their compensation tax deductions. Mr. Speaker, let us not lose sight of the fact that it took Republicans 7 years of undermining the Affordable Care Act to finally come up with this proposal for replacing it. b1345 Their plan would kick millions of Americans off their health insurance and force millions more to pay higher premiums. It would take health care away from the poor, give tax cuts to the rich, and pull the rug out from under seniors, families, and children. In fact, this plan is so bad that Republicans literally hid not only their horrific proposal, but themselves, from their constituents. Many of their Members are seeing it just in the last 36 hours. They did this by callously brushing off townhall meeting after townhall meeting. Why all the smoke and mirrors regarding something as simple as this measure is in light of the fact that they ran on replacing it? Why hide it and why rush it and why go through this charade that most of us know and several Senators said yesterday will be dead on arrival? Actually, let me ask the American people. Who do you think the Republican Party is representing, you or corporate America? Mr. Speaker, we are not even a full 2 months into the Republicanled government and, in addition to the unconstitutional Muslim bans—and notice I said ‘‘bans,’’ because the old one is nothing but the new one, and the new one is the old one, minus one, and that is the country of Iraq—we have the Republican denial of clear Russian influence in our most recent election. Let me be very clear about this particular aspect. All of the intelligence agencies have indicated that there was Russian interference in this last election. I don’t understand why we are not totally outraged and why there is not extraordinary emphasis on this kind of action against our fundamental democracy. It is ridiculous that we are around here doing things that we know are not likely to pass the United States Senate and that we are disapproving regulations, yet we cannot get an independent commission to make a determination of how this impact occurred. And we do know that it occurred. I am outraged, and I would hope more Americans would be as well. We have also seen the almost immediate recusal of the Attorney General due to his inability to be forthright with our Senate colleagues; wild and baseless claims emanating from late night Twitter storms from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or MaraLago; and we have a Republican Party dedicated to ensuring that their corporate benefactors can rest easy, no matter the harm they cause to everyday working Americans. Are we addressing any of these concerns here today? I would imagine my colleague, rightly, will come back and argue that all the things that I just talked about are not this particular rule. Well, this rule is not even deserving of that kind of consideration, largely for the reason it is yet another structured rule disallowing Members of this House to have an opportunity to have input into a measure that is getting rid of a century of precedent in our judiciary. No, what we are doing is debating obscure civil procedure rules that date back to the days of President Teddy Roosevelt. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the gentleman from Florida that we are debating the special order of business from rules and that all comments must be relevant to the rule or the underlying bill. This particular underlying bill has to do with a rule of civil procedure and fraudulent joinders. It does not have to do with the gentleman’s healthcare replacement act or his thoughts on the healthcare replacement act, insurance executive’s compensation, individual mandates, tax cuts for the rich, Russia, Iraq, although I did appreciate the gentleman’s memories from law school the year that I was born. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ). Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, it is a delight for me to join the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) on a piece of legislation that actually has his name on it, he is responsible for, understands, and is prepared today to fully debate. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Florida, a member of the Rules Committee, for not only coming down to offer his argument against the facts of the case as they reside today on this important piece of legislation, but I also want to acknowledge that I know the frustration. I know there is a lot of frustration. There is a lot of frustration from our colleagues who have lost the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. They are in the middle of what might be called wandering, as they have called it, in the darkness or in the doldrums of being deep in the minority. With that said, there is an agenda that is being laid out before the American people. It happened, Mr. Speaker, directly as a result of what we call an election—an election where all these issues, or most of them that have been discussed by the gentleman, were fully debated not only in a theater near you, but directly in congressional contests, in senatorial contests and the debates for the President of the United States. The facts of the case are really pretty simple. The Republican Party will be talking about all the issues that the gentleman brought up today right before our eyes. Probably on C–SPAN, trying to compete against us, is a hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee. The gentleman, GREG WALDEN , the chairman of the committee, over the weekend released the text of the chairman’s mark, the ‘‘bill’’ of the Republican Party of how we are going to look at health care. It is true that we have Chairman DEVIN NUNES of the Intelligence Committee looking at the issue that was 
brought up of Russia. We have forthrightly, over the weekend, said: All right. We are being asked to look at this. Just so you know, media, American people, we are going to do that. We are going to do what you have asked because we believe it is the right thing to do: open hearings, open debate, acknowledgement of the issues, and a certainty that we will go look into it, and we are going to let you know what we find. That is really where we are. This morning, at 8 a.m. in my office, I cohosted with the gentleman from Florida an opportunity for the American Bar Association. We brought in, from across this country—I didn’t bring them in; they came into my office from across the country—a number of wellestablished, thoughtful, and articulate people. We didn’t ask: Are you Republican? We didn’t ask: Are you Democrat? We said: You represent your organization, and we want to hear from you. This is the kind of leadership that I believe not only myself but also the gentleman, Mr. HASTINGS , wants to be associated with. We want to be associated with listening to the American people, trying to be thoughtful about what we do and have equal participation. The gentleman knows that at the Rules Committee yesterday we had a very thoughtful person representing the Republican Party. The gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) came up. We had Mr. BUCK, who was able to come and talk about this issue today. In fact, it might be an arcane issue to the American people, but it consumes a lot of time, and it has a deliberative effect on the outcome of important cases in Federal courts and State courts across the country. We feel like it is worthy of an afternoon, an afternoon at the Rules Committee, to fully vet the legislation and an afternoon here on the floor of the House of Representatives. But like any other good majority, we have a lot of other things going on, and we are looking at the Affordable Care Act, how it worked and how we might thoughtfully replace it. We are looking at the issues related to Russia. We are looking at the American Bar Association. Members of Congress are extremely busy, but, Mr. Speaker, I think, with great respect, we should give the author of the bill, Mr. BUCK, his time to come and thoughtfully explain why we are doing what we are doing. I am just a dadgum chairman of the committee. I just do the things that I hope are necessary to look at every single item and being fair—being fair in the ability that people have to come and bring their ideas and trying to be fair in trying to bring them down here. So I want to thank the gentleman for acknowledging this body is busy. This body is engaged in, as we speak, a public, open debate about what direction health care should go. What I would like to offer is my evaluation of where we are going to be. We are going to be at a point where we do not have to scare people about where we have been or why we are going to a place. I am on what is known as ObamaCare. As a Member of Congress, I am legally required to be on ObamaCare for health care. But, Mr. Speaker, it is twice as expensive as what I had before; and it is not working for me, it is not working for my family, and it is not working for a lot of people. So we are trying to look at how we might carefully, thoughtfully, artfully work with the American people, so we put the bill up and let you see it. We don’t have to pass it to find out what is in it. We are trying to read the bill and understand it first. Mr. Speaker, it is not a pledge. It is a hope that every single Member of this body will understand what is in the bill before they can respectfully, whether somebody disagrees or agrees with it, explain the bill for what is correct. What is correct about the bill is this: if you like your own doctor, you can keep your own doctor. If you like your own healthcare plan, even if it is ObamaCare, you can do that, too. The Republican Party is open about what we believe. We are trying to be thoughtful with the American people. Mr. Speaker, I believe, with the leadership that we have of PAULRYANwho has attempted to work through a difficult issue, the American people will understand why Republicans not only won the election, but why Republicans have better ideas in health care, too. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the chairman of the Rules Committee and he knows that. I just heard him say his insurance went up under ObamaCare. Mine did, too. I also want to remind him that, if this measure as offered yesterday were to become law, his and my insurance is going to go up again. So we weren’t doing all of the things that you said you were going to do by bringing the price down. In addition, we don’t even know what CBO’s score is with respect to this matter. You said that you are reading it to understand it now, yet Members are in the Energy and Commerce Committee, as you explained, marking it up, and they don’t even know what CBO’s score is. I will get back to that in a few minutes about all these people we pay over there to do that work, and then we are not utilizing them. I also want to address my friend from Colorado and have him understand that I am not precluded from presenting to the American public what legislation we wish to prioritize. As the gentleman knows, we are currently debating the rule. This is a tool used to set the House agenda and to prioritize consideration of legislation. For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would like to prioritize and what agenda we would like to pursue in this House. I won’t reiterate it, in the interest of time. I will have a previous question that will demonstrably show what legislation we think we should be addressing. I will do that for as long as I am given the opportunity to manage rules. I will come down here and present the position of the Democratic Party so that they understand our priorities and not necessarily am I hidebound by this rule. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1400 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ). Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, without continuing the dialogue, I would like to at least respond to the gentleman and look right at you, Mr. Speaker, and tell you, in fact, we are going to have a CBO score. We are going to have a CBO score when we have an agreed upon bill. This is a process that is open. The bill is being proposed. The bill is going to be debated. Then there are going to be votes. For them to presume that they know the score before they know the outcome is not the way the chairman of the committee looks at it. Mr. WALDEN  looks at it that he is going to let the committee vote and come up with a bill, and there are significant changes that could happen one way or another. I think it would be a presumptuous viewpoint to say here is the bill and here is the score, take it or leave it. I know Chairman WALDEN very well, and GREGWALDEN is trying to operate off openness and the agreement to look at the bill. When it is finalized, a score will become available. I appreciate the gentleman bringing this issue up. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING). Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding. I especially thank him for bringing this legislation before this Congress. I rise in support of this rule and the underlying bill. We are addressing the topic that we used to call fraudulent joinder. I like the title of this bill better, as pointed out by Ms. SLAUGHTER  last night. We call it the Innocent Party Protection Act. It is more accurate and it is more descriptive. The other fraudulent joinder piece tends to put people to sleep who aren’t operating in this arena. I know that the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) has operated in this arena. He has significant experience and frustrating experience watching innocent parties being drug into litigation just so that an opposing attorney can utilize that jurisdiction within a 
particular State where they think they have a friendly venue. First, Mr. Speaker, I make the point from the beginning, which we don’t often enough do here, and that is our pledge we made some years ago that all of our legislation would be indexed back to the Constitution. We don’t always address that in the debate. I just turn my pocket Constitution to Article III, section 1. It says: ‘‘The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.’’ We agree with that. I have made this point that all of the Federal courts are completely under the jurisdiction of the United States Congress. If we decided that we wanted to abolish a Federal district, we could do that. In fact, it happened 200 years ago, two districts. I don’t propose such a thing, but I am just asserting the power of Congress, which hasn’t been questioned or challenged, I would point out. Under section 2, it says: ‘‘The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising . . . between Citizens of different States. . . .’’ This is a tool, then, that the fraudulent joinder attorneys use to drag people into litigation who may have nothing to do with it whatsoever. It is a problem. It is a problem, we know, not just because there are complaints out there from innocent parties that have been wrapped up in litigation and required to defend themselves and hire attorneys and spend thousands of dollars—tens of thousands—hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to protect their economic interests even though they have zero involvement in the case and perhaps zero chance of having any judgment brought against them. So apparently the judges who make these decisions look at rule 11 and they find enough latitude in there that they allow the defendants to stay on the case, and I will call them being fraudulently joined to the case. We need to tighten up these rules. We need to send a very clear message to the courts so that they have got some guidelines to live by because it is their job, of course, to read the law, take their directions from the United States Congress, and act accordingly. I think just this debate and the debate we had in the last Congress help us in that cause. The next thing I pick up from the Constitution, the next thing is the bill itself, and prevention of fraudulent joinder is under section 2. It sets out four different categories that would be cause for the court to release a defendant. And it says the joinder of the defendant is described in this paragraph. It says it is fraudulent if the court finds that in one of four different categories there is actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts, which, with respect to that defendant, if there is actual fraud, that is pretty much a nobrainer, should be released from the case. That is pretty simple. I am glad it is now an opportunity to go into statute. Second is if it is based on a complaint and the materials submitted under the paragraph, it is not plausible to conclude that the applicable State law would impose liability on that defendant. In other words, if it is implausible for the defendant to have a liability, then the court can release that defendant under this act should it become law. That is also, to me, a no brainer. As one who has been a defendant in lawsuits, I would reflect, Mr. Speaker, that when I first ran for office, there were some people who thought that I should just simply capitulate to whatever their legal demands were. Even though I have only been in the courtroom a couple handful of times throughout the 40some years of business that we have done as King Construction, I had four of them lined up against me at the same time. They thought that I would just have to settle out of court. It is a frustrating thing to not see a liability but have that leverage brought against you. I have experienced that, and that animates me on this. The third component is if a State or Federal law clearly bars all claims in the complaint against that defendant. All right, that is also a simple provision. But the fourth one is another one that deserves consideration, and that is that there be a good faith intention. Otherwise, if there is no good faith intention to prosecute the action against that defendant or to seek a joint judgment which would include that defendant, then that defendant can be released from the case. We need to streamline our courts, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROTHFUS ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I would just summarize this case in that it is not only me, it is not Mr. BUCK alone, it is not Mr. SESSIONS alone, it is the American people who are calling out for this kind of relief. It is not just the American people—we might consider them to be laypersons in this— but it is also the courts. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Harvie Wilkinson, as Mr. BUCKquoted, spoke to this issue. The Supreme Court of the United States has spoken to this issue under ‘‘plausible’’ versus ‘‘speculative.’’ Professor Martin Redish also has spoken on this subject matter. The Third Circuit spoke to the Briscoe issue. The final piece is the Fifth Circuit has essentially adopted a very similar, if not identical, policy. We need to codify this. This is our chance to do so. I urge adoption of the rule and support of the underlying rule. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for his thoughts. May I inquire how much time is remaining on my side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado has 10 minutes remaining. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ) that I have no additional speakers. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule which would modify the rules of the House to require a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office before any legislation that would amend or repeal the Affordable Care Act may be considered in committee or on the House floor. The Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Energy and Commerce are marking up repeal legislation today. Legislation this significant should not advance through the committee process, let alone the House, without first hearing from our nonpartisan budget experts at the Congressional Budget Office on what the cost and overall impact will be. Mr. Speaker, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office. We pay them collectively—and administrative duties—nearly $50 million a year to advise us at times exactly like this. House rules already require the Congressional Budget Office cost estimates to be included in committee reports. We are simply trying to improve and strengthen this principle of transparency in order to ensure that we know the cost of this repeal legislation before we vote, and that includes the members in the Committee on Energy and Commerce today who are marking this up so as how they would know the cost before they vote in committee today. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, it is not too late for my friends across the aisle to tether themselves to the ideals that have made this country great for generations; ideals that, if we are to be saved from the rushing current we presently find ourselves being dragged down by, will be, as they always have been, those ideals which save us from ourselves. We are a nation built upon the strength of immigrants, of teachers, of doctors, of mill workers, garbagemen and women, smallbusiness owners, and farmers. We are a nation of dreamers and innovators, respectful of our individuality and mindful of our unparalleled power once unified in common cause. At some point, my Republican friends will, I hope, realize that their unabashed and wholesale championing 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on ordering the previous question on House Resolution 175 will be followed by 5minute votes on adoption of House Resolution 175, if ordered; ordering the previous question on House Resolution 174; and adoption of House Resolution 174, if ordered.

TITLE VII RELATED AGENCIES CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT  
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELING HUYSEN ) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1301, and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H.R. 1301, the Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2017. In total, this bill provides $577.9 billion in funding for the Department of Defense: $516.1 billion in discretionary funding and $61.8 billion in overseas contingency operations and global war on terrorism funding. When combined with the funding provided in the continuing resolution supplemental enacted in December, total defense funding for fiscal year 2017 equals $584 billion, consistent with the top line provided in the National Defense Authorization Act, and $10.9 billion more than fiscal year 2016 levels. Mr. Speaker, strengthening our national security and rebuilding our military starts today, with this agreement, 
the first step after years of cutbacks. Our Armed Forces and intelligence community are currently operating under a continuing resolution, which denies them stability and predictability, both of which they have not had for many years. H.R. 1301 provides that stability, removing defense funding from under continuing resolution autopilot, preventing further damage to our national defense and providing additional support for our men and women in uniform and their families. Our troops serve with honor in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, South Korea, Japan, across the Baltics, the Sinai, and Africa on the ground, in the air, and aboard ships across the globe doing the work of freedom. Mr. Speaker, this agreement rejects the troop reductions proposed by the previous administration, providing for increased endstrength levels authorized by the NDAA: 1.3 million Active Duty troops and 813,000 National Guard and Reserve troops, all of whom work as one team. Our bill also fully funds the authorized 2.1 percent pay raise and provides increased funding for Defense Health Programs to ensure full care for all of our warfighters, their families, and military retirees. This agreement also ensures that our Armed Forces have the training and equipment they need to conduct successful missions. Funding is increased for key readiness programs that prepare and train our troops and that modernize essential military installations. It reverses the previous administration’s cuts to procurement, providing for additional production of stateoftheart aircraft and ships. In addition, we enhance cyber and ISR programs, or intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance programs, capabilities our combatant commanders badly need. This reflects congressional priorities. We took into account the views of each and every Member who worked with us throughout the process. This is a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that deserves the support of the House. I thank Chairwoman KAYGRANGER  for her efforts in bringing this bill to the floor today and for taking over the leadership of the Defense Subcommittee in January. I also thank the subcommittee’s ranking member, Mr. VISCLOSKY , for his contributions to this bill and the earlier bill. He has been an excellent partner throughout this process, and I am grateful for our continued strong working relationship. In addition, I commend NITALOWEY , the ranking member of the full committee, for her partnership and commitment to completing all of our appropriations work. Lastly, I thank the staff of the subcommittee that is behind me, both minority and majority, as well as our personal offices and the full Appropriations Committee for their tireless work putting this bill together. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Will Smith and David Pomerantz, the outgoing staff directors for the Appropriations Committee, both majority and minority, in this remarkable committee. Both have made immeasurable contributions to the Appropriations Committee in this institution, and we are indebted for their service. We thank both of them and wish them both the best. Mr. Speaker, today our Nation faces a dangerous and unpredictable world. At the same time, our Armed Forces are struggling to have our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines fully trained and ready to meet every conceivable threat. That important work to address that critical situation starts with this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the agreement, and I reserve the balance of my time. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT SUBMITTED BY MR. FRELINGHUYSEN, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS REGARDING H.R. 1301 The following is an explanation of the effects of this Act, which makes appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017. Unless otherwise noted, references to the House and Senate reports are to House Report 114–577 and Senate Report 114–263, respectively. The language contained in the House and Senate reports warrant full compliance and carry the same weight as language included in this explanatory statement unless specifically addressed to the contrary in the bill or this explanatory statement. While repeating some language from the House or Senate reports for emphasis, this explanatory statement does not intend to negate the language referred to above unless expressly provided herein. 
ACTIVITY  For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–177), as amended by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100– 119), and by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508), the terms ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ for appropriations contained in this Act shall be defined as the most specific level of budget items identified in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017, the related classified annexes and explanatory statements, and the P–1 and R–1 budget justification documents as subsequently modified by congressional action. The following exception to the above definition shall apply: the military personnel and the operation and maintenance accounts, for which the term ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ is defined as the appropriations accounts contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. At the time the President submits the budget request for fiscal year 2018, the Secretary of Defense is directed to transmit to the congressional defense committees budget justification documents to be known as the ‘‘M–1’’ and the ‘‘O–1’’ which shall identify, at the budget activity, activity group, and sub activity group level, the amounts requested by the President to be appropriated to the Department of Defense for military personnel and operation and maintenance in any budget request, or amended budget request, for fiscal year 2018. 
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE  The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming guidance for acquisition accounts as specified in the report accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110– 279). For operation and maintenance accounts, the Secretary of Defense shall continue to follow the reprogramming guidelines specified in the conference report accompanying H.R. 3222, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008. The dollar threshold for reprogramming funds shall remain at $10,000,000 for military personnel; $15,000,000 for operation and maintenance; $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation. Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to continue to provide the congressional defense committees annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II and quarterly, spreadsheetbased DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defensewide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of a military personnel (M–1), an operation and maintenance (O–1), a procurement (P–1), or a research, development, test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest items are established elsewhere in this statement. FUNDING INCREASES  The funding increases outlined in the tables for each appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables. 
CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided or items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. 
CLASSIFIED ANNEX  Adjustments to classified programs are addressed in the accompanying classified annex. 
SUBCOMMITTEES  The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees rely heavily on offices within the Comptroller organizations of the military departments and the Office of the Secretary of Defense to conduct their oversight responsibilities and make funding recommendations for the Department of Defense. Established in the 1970s in accordance with a recommendation of the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel, these offices facilitate the appropriate flow of information between the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees and the Comptroller of the respective department or agency. In the early 1990s, the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees restated the 
support these organizations provide to the Committees and noted that ‘‘while the various offices of legislative affairs offer great assistance to DoD and the Congress, they do not provide the expertise and the direct relationship to the Comptroller organizations which are essential to the effective communication between DoD and the Committees on Appropriations.’’ Further, the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 echoed the imperative to maintain the existing liaison structure to achieve the highest level of communication and trust between the Department of Defense and the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees. The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees repeat this support for the budget liaison organizations and reiterate previously stated concerns that efforts to incorporate these organizations into the military and Office of the Secretary of Defense legislative affairs offices would be deleterious to the appropriations process and to the utility of the budget liaison operation. Therefore, the agreement retains a provision in title II of this Act from previous years that prohibits the use of funds in this Act to plan or implement the consolidation of a budget or appropriations liaison office of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the office of the Secretary of a military department, or the Service headquarters of one of the Armed Forces into a legislative affairs or legislative liaison office. 
CYBERSPACE ACTIVITIES  The agreement fully funds the fiscal year 2017 base budget requirement of $6,734,000,000 for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and the defense agencies cyberspace activities, an increase of $992,000,000 over the fiscal year 2016 enacted level. While the Service and defensewide budget justification material, as well as the Department of Defense classified cyberspace activities information technology investments budget justification materials, provide some level of detail, much of the funding is encompassed within larger programs and funding lines, which limits visibility and congressional oversight of requested funding for cyberspace activities specifically. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer is directed to modify the cyberspace activities exhibit in order to provide increased visibility and clarity into the cyberspace activities funding requirements and changes to funding requirements from the previous fiscal year enacted levels, to segregate civilian and military pay, and to provide a crosswalk between the cyberspace activities justification books and the Services and defensewide budget justification material. Further, in order to provide additional clarity and to enhance oversight, the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Service Secretaries, is directed to conduct a review of the budget justification material and provide a proposal to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not later than September 1, 2017, for how to clearly delineate the Department of Defense cyber investment activities requested in the operation and maintenance, procurement, and research, development, test and evaluation accounts as part of the budget justification material beginning with the fiscal year 2019 budget submission. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Chief Information Officer are encouraged to consider establishing a unique cyber subactivity group for operation and maintenance accounts and individual cost codes, projects, or program elements for procurement and research, development, test and evaluation accounts as part of this review. The Department of Defense cyberspace activities table provided shows the amount of funding provided to each Service and defensewide account in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Funding appropriated therein may be used only for cyberspace activities as defined by the classified cyberspace activities information technology investment budget request for fiscal year 2017. The Secretary of Defense is directed to use normal prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funding out of any operation and maintenance, procurement, or research, development, test and evaluation accounts as identified in the table titled ‘‘Department of Defense Cyberspace Activities’’ for any purpose other than cyberspace activities. The Department of Defense Chief Information Officer shall submit to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees two reports not later than May 30, 2017, and November 30, 2017, which provide the midyear and end of fiscal year financial obligation and execution data for cyberspace activities of each year. This language replaces the language included under the heading ‘‘Cyberspace Operations’’ in House Report 114–577.

MILITARY PERSONNEL OVERVIEW  The agreement provides the resources required for an additional 24,000 active forces and 12,000 selected reserve forces, as authorized by current law and above the requested end strength levels, in order to meet operational needs for fiscal year 2017. The agreement also provides the funding necessary to support a 2.1 percent pay raise for all military personnel, as authorized, effective January 1, 2017. 
PERSONNEL ACCOUNTS  The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2017 appropriations accounts not later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any purpose other than originally appropriated until the aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in the Services’ military personnel accounts between budget activities in excess of $10,000,000. MILITARY PERSONNEL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided or have been specifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or reduce funding from congressional special interest items as identified on the DD Form 1414. MILITARY BANDS  Military bands honor and celebrate warfighters, promote patriotism during community events, inspire servicemembers, and enhance efforts to recruit and retain troops. Band engagements play an important support role for national security and joint operations, opening diplomatic doors for political and military discussions while building trust and confidence with foreign military and civilian authorities. However, the activities of military bands must not detract from the core competencies of the military. The Secretary of Defense should review opportunities to ensure that only the critical functions of military bands are supported while minimizing impacts on funding for essential readiness, military personnel, modernization, and research and development activities.

AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTS  The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2017 appropriation accounts not later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any purpose other than originally appropriated until the aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in the Services’ operation and maintenance accounts between O–1 budget activities in excess of $15,000,000. In addition, the Secretary of Defense should follow prior approval reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of $15,000,000 out of the following budget subactivities: Army: Maneuver units Modular support brigades Land forces operations support Force readiness operations support Land forces depot maintenance Base operations support Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization Navy: Mission and other flight operations Aircraft depot maintenance Mission and other ship operations Ship depot maintenance Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization Marine Corps: Depot maintenance Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization Air Force: Primary combat forces Combat enhancement forces Operating forces depot maintenance Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization Mobilization depot maintenance Training and recruiting depot maintenance Administration and servicewide depot maintenance Air Force Reserve: Depot maintenance Air National Guard: Depot maintenance Additionally, the Secretary of Defense should follow prior approval reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of $15,000,000 into the following budget subactivity: Operation and Maintenance, Army National Guard: Other personnel support/recruiting and advertising With respect to Operation and Maintenance, DefenseWide, proposed transfers of funds to or from the levels specified for defense agencies in excess of $15,000,000 shall be subject to prior approval reprogramming procedures. 
INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided or have been specifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or reduce funding from congressional special interest items as identified on the DD Form 1414. 
READINESS  The agreement provides additional readiness funds for the Services within the operation and maintenance accounts. This funding shall be used only to improve military readiness, including increased training, depot maintenance, and base operations support. None of the funding provided may be used for recruiting, marketing, or advertising programs. The funding provided is a congressional special interest item. The Secretary of Defense and the Service Secretaries are directed to submit a detailed spending plan by subactivity group to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not less than 30 days prior to the obligation of these funds. These transfers may be implemented 30 days after congressional notification unless an objection is received from either the House or Senate Appropriations Committees. 
ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT  The agreement does not include a provision included in the Housepassed version of H.R. 5293 that referenced the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. It is noted that the enforcement of section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 may lead to higher fuel costs for federal fleets in the absence of competitively priced new generation fuels that emit fewer emissions. In carrying out this statute, the Secretary of Defense and the Service Secretaries should work to ensure that costs associated with fuel purchases necessary to carry out their respective missions should be minimized to the greatest extent possible. CIVILIAN PAY RAISE  Although the agreement does not include additional funds specifically for the civilian pay increase from 1.6 percent to 2.1 percent, sufficient funding is available within the appropriations accounts to fully fund the increase due to assets created by the civilian hiring freeze and the extended length of H.R. 2028, theFurther Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017. 
AQUEOUS FILM FORMING FOAM  The use of the fireextinguishing agent Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) by the Department of Defense has been linked to elevated levels of perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) on military bases and in neighboring communities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, PFCs have adverse impacts on human health. The Navy and Air Force have begun remediation of PFC contamination. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged to require all Services to establish procedures for prompt and costeffective remediation. In addition, the Secretary of Defense is directed to submit a report to the congressional defense committees not later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act that assesses the number of formerly used and current military installations where AFFF was or is currently used and the impact of PFC contaminated drinking water on surrounding communities. The report should also include plans for prompt community notification of such contamination, when the contamination was detected, and the procedures for timely remediation.

PROGRAMLANGUAGE ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM  For more than twenty years, the National Guard State Partnership Program (SPP) has been successfully building unique security relationships with more than 75 nations around the globe. To build on the success of this program, the agreement recommends that the Chief of the National Guard Bureau encourage the enhancement of individual language skills and prioritize language school appointments of soldiers and airmen within the program to help further strengthen these international relationships. Additionally, servicemembers of the National Guard that participate in, and are from states with units assigned to state partnership activities should strive to attend language schools, both defensesponsored and otherwise; obtain computerassisted languagelearning software; and use international visits through the SPP as a means of language skill immersion.

ACCOUNTS  The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation. Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to continue to provide the congressional defense committees quarterly, spreadsheetbased DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defensewide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or research, development, test and evaluation (R– 1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest items are established elsewhere in this statement. 
FUNDING INCREASES  The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables. 
PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. 
AND CONTRACTING  Throughout the fiscal year 2017 budget review process, the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Joint Program Office provided insufficient justification and incomplete information in an untimely manner. It is imperative that requested information is received promptly for proper congressional oversight of this major defense acquisition program. It is understood that the Secretary of Defense is reviewing potential alternative management structures for the JSF program as directed by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–328). This review will provide an opportunity to improve communication between the JSF Program Executive Officer (PEO), the Services, and the congressional defense committees to ensure the program’s funding requirements are fully understood, communicated, and justified. Additionally, there is concern that the number of F–35s enacted in annual Department of Defense Appropriations Acts are not being placed on contract by the JSF PEO in a timely manner. Four F–35s included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 and 13 F–35s included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 were not part of their respective low rate initial production (LRIP) contracts due to the PEO’s contracting strategy. Specifically, only four F–35Cs were included on LRIPs 9 and 10, rather than the ten F–35Cs enacted in the Department of Defense Appropriations Acts, 2015 and 2016, impeding production efficiencies. The agreement directs the JSF PEO to use a contracting approach that would award all aircraft included in each Department of Defense Appropriations Act on the respective production contract for that fiscal year. The agreement includes funding for 74 F–35 aircraft. The JSF PEO is directed to brief the congressional defense committees not later than 45 days after the enactment of this Act on the contracting strategy for these aircraft.

DDG51 FLIGHT IIA DESTROYERS  The Navy currently is procuring DDG–51 Flight IIA destroyers under a fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2017 multiyear procurement shipbuilding contract awarded in June 2013, as authorized by section 8010 of Public Law 113–6. Additionally, the Navy is addressing increasing ballistic and cruise missile threats through the development and acquisition of an Air and Missile Defense Radar, which is planned for integration on the DDG–51 class of ships through an engineering change proposal, resulting in a new Flight III configuration. However, a recent Government Accountability Office report (GAO 16– 613) details concerns regarding a lack of sufficient acquisition and limited detail design knowledge to support the Navy’s current Flight III procurement strategy. Further concerns remain regarding the full costs of DDG–51 Flight III destroyers. Therefore, the Secretary of the Navy should award and complete the additional DDG–51 ship, fully funded in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, as an additional DDG–51 Flight IIA ship. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to expeditiously award this ship construction contract. 
POLAR ICEBREAKER RECAPITALIZATION PROJECT  The Navy and the Coast Guard are collaborating to refine requirements and an acquisition strategy for procurement of an affordable polar icebreaker. This collaboration continues to refine program costs and requirements in an effort to award a detailed design and construction contract for the lead ship in fiscal year 2019. The agreement supports this effort and provides $150,000,000 in advance procurement funding to buy long lead time material for the program’s initial ship. The Coast Guard is encouraged to budget for followon efforts. OTHER PROCUREMENT, NAVY The agreement on items addressed by either the House or the Senate is as follows:

ACCOUNTS  The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation. Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to continue to provide the congressional defense committees quarterly, spreadsheetbased DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defensewide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or research, development, test and evaluation (R– 1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest items are established elsewhere in this statement. 
FUNDING INCREASES  The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables. 
EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER FOLLOW ON 
MODERNIZATION  The Joint Strike Fighter Program Executive Officer is directed to comply with the reporting requirement included under the heading ‘‘Joint Strike Fighter Followon Modernization’’ in Senate Report 114–263. The Secretary of Defense is not required to comply with the reporting requirement included under the heading ‘‘Joint Strike Fighter Followon Development’’ in House Report 114–577.

HEALTH PROGRAM  Concerns remain regarding the transfer of funds from the InHouse Care budget subactivity to pay for contractorprovided medical care. To limit such transfers and improve oversight within the Defense Health Program operation and maintenance account, the agreement includes a provision which caps the funds available for Private Sector Care under the TRICARE program subject to prior approval reprogramming procedures. The provision and accompanying explanatory statement language should not be interpreted as limiting the amount of funds that may be transferred to the InHouse Care budget subactivity from other budget sub activities within the Defense Health Program. In addition, funding for the InHouse Care budget subactivity continues to be designated as a congressional special interest item. Any transfer of funds from the In House Care budget subactivity into the Private Sector Care budget subactivity or any other budget subactivity requires the Secretary of Defense to follow prior approval reprogramming procedures for operation and maintenance funds. The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide written notification to the congressional defense committees of cumulative transfers in excess of $10,000,000 out of the Private Sector Care budget subactivity not later than fifteen days after such a transfer. Furthermore, the Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to the congressional defense committees not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act that delineates transfers of funds in excess of $10,000,000, and the dates any transfers occurred, from the Private Sector Care budget subactivity to any other budget subactivity groups for fiscal year 2016. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is directed to provide quarterly reports to the congressional defense committees on budget execution data for all of the Defense Health Program budget activities and to adequately reflect changes to the budget activities requested by the Services in future budget submissions. 
PEER REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM  The agreement provides $60,000,000 for the peerreviewed cancer research program to research cancers not addressed in the breast, prostate, ovarian, kidney, and lung cancer research programs. The funds provided in the peerreviewed cancer research program are directed to be used to conduct research in the following areas: bladder cancer, brain cancer, colorectal cancer, immunotherapy, listeria based regimens for cancer, liver cancer, lymphoma, melanoma and other skin cancers, mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, pediatric brain tumors, stomach cancer, and cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults. The reports directed under this heading in House Report 114–577 and Senate Report 114– 263 are still required. PEER REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM  The agreement provides $300,000,000 for a peerreviewed medical research program. The Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the Service Surgeons General, is directed to select medical research projects of clear scientific merit and direct relevance to military health. Research areas considered under this funding are restricted to the following areas: acute lung injury, antimicrobial resistance, arthritis, burn pit exposure, chronic migraine and posttraumatic headache, congenital heart disease, constrictive bronchiolitis, diabetes, diarrheal diseases, dystonia, early trauma thermal regulation, eating disorders, emerging infectious diseases, epidermolysis bullosa, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, Fragile X, GuillainBarre syndrome, hepatitis B and C, hereditary angioedema, hydrocephalus, immunomonitoring of intestinal transplants, inflammatory bowel diseases, influenza, integrative medicine, interstitial cystitis, malaria, metals toxicology, mitochondrial disease, musculoskeletal disorders, nanomaterials for bone regeneration, nonopioid pain management, pancreatitis, pathogeninactivated dried cryoprecipitate, polycystic kidney disease, posttraumatic osteoarthritis, pulmonary fibrosis, respiratory health, Rett syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, sleep disorders, spinal muscular atrophy, sustainedrelease drug delivery, tinnitus, tuberculosis, vaccine development for infectious disease, vascular malformations, and women’s heart disease. The additional funding provided under the peerreviewed medical research program shall be devoted only to the purposes listed above. 
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM  Concerns remain with the progress being made by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to fully develop, procure, and deploy an interoperable electronic health record solution. The two systems must be completely and meaningfully interoperable, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) is encouraged to focus on the overall goal of seamless compatibility between the two Departments’ electronic health record systems. For the necessary oversight of this important program, the Program Executive Officer (PEO) for the Defense Healthcare Management Systems (DHMS) is directed to provide quarterly reports to the congressional defense committees and the Government Accountability Office on the cost and schedule of the program, to include milestones, knowledge points, and acquisition timelines, as well as quarterly obligation reports. These reports should also include any changes to the deployment timeline, including benchmarks, for full operating capability; any refinements to the cost estimate for full operating capability and the total lifecycle cost of the program; an assurance that the acquisition strategy will comply with the acquisition rules, requirements, guidelines, and systems acquisition management practices of the federal government; the status of the effort to achieve interoperability between the electronic health record systems of the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, including the scope, cost, schedule, mapping to health data standards, and performance benchmarks of the interoperable record; and the progress toward developing, implementing, and fielding the interoperable electronic health record throughout the two Departments’ medical facilities. The PEO DHMS is directed to continue briefing the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on a quarterly basis, coinciding with the report submission. Given that full deployment of the new electronic health record is not scheduled until fiscal year 2022, the Department of Defense is expected to continue working on interim modifications and enhancements to the current system to improve interoperability in the nearterm. Additionally, the PEO DHMS is directed to provide written notification to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees prior to obligating any contract, or combination of contracts, for electronic health record systems in excess of $5,000,000. Additionally, the Director of the Interagency Program Office is directed to continue to provide quarterly briefings on standards development, how those standards are being incorporated by the two Departments, and the progress of interoperability to the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees for Defense and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. In an effort to ensure government wide accountability, the PEO DHMS, in coordination with the appropriate personnel of the Department of Veterans Affairs, is directed to provide the Federal Chief Information Officer of the United States with monthly updates on progress made by the two Departments to reach interoperability and modernize their respective electronic health records.

TOTAL, JOINT IMPROVISEDTHREAT FUND 408,272 339,472 JOINT IMPROVISED THREAT DEFEAT FUND  The fiscal year 2017 budget request includes $408,272,000 in Overseas Contingency Operations funding for the Joint Improvised Threat Defeat Fund. To preserve the essential joint capabilities of the Joint ImprovisedThreat Defeat Organization (JIDO) and eliminate any duplication with Service capabilities, the agreement recommends transferring $62,800,000 to the Operation and Maintenance, DefenseWide account in title IX. The budget request proposed consolidating the subaccounts under the appropriation into a single account titled Rapid Acquisition and Threat Response. This flexibility would allow for quick reaction changes in spending; however, it would prevent the congressional defense committees from having any insight into why or when these funding changes occur. Therefore, the agreement provides the following funding levels for JIDO programs: $101,286,000 for Rapid Capability Delivery; $200,886,000 for Assist Situational Understanding; and $37,300,000 for Enable Department of Defense Responsiveness. The Director of the JIDO is directed to provide quarterly reports to the congressional defense committees should funding be shifted between the accounts not later than 15 days after the end of the fiscal quarter.

Title VI Other Department of Defense Programs ...... . 
Title IXGlobal War on Terrorism (GWOT) ............ . FY 2016 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by congratulating Chairman FRELING HUYSEN on bringing his first full bill to the House floor as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I have greatly appreciated his friendship and steady leadership of the Defense Subcommittee. Further, I also thank our new subcommittee chairwoman, KAYGRANGER . She has been a great partner in completing the work on the fiscal year 2017 conference report, and I look forward to working with her as we proceed. Finally, I thank the members of the subcommittee and our extraordinary staff for their wisdom and for their long hours that they have logged in putting this product together. The chairman has well described H.R. 1301. I would add that this bill includes strong positions countering Russian aggression, building partnership capacity, and supporting readiness. Because it is a product of bipartisan negotiation, this is a good bill, and I intend to support it. Despite my support for this legislation, I am extremely troubled that we are still working on the fiscal year 2017 Defense bill 5 months and 8 days into the fiscal year. For nearly 6 months, the Department of Defense has been operating under two separate continuing resolutions, which wastes the time of people’s lives and leads to inefficiencies in spending. I would emphasize this is not the fault of the committee. All that has been absent is the lack of political will on behalf of the majority party. Even more disconcerting is the fact that the Defense Appropriations Act is just one of 11 fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills that need to be completed by the end of next month. There is no excuse for them remaining unfinished. The investments made through these bills are vital to so many in our country, and they need equal attention from Congress and the administration. It is imperative that we strive every day to prioritize keeping America safe and supporting our brave servicemembers, but we must also prioritize educating our workforce, making improvements in public health, in science, and in our economic and transportation infrastructure. If we neglect these investments in our future and in the wellbeing and success of current families and future generations, then I am deeply concerned that we will not have a country worth defending. Confounding a confused fiscal situation, there is a $30 billion supplemental request for fiscal year 2017 recently submitted to the Office of Management and Budget by the Department of Defense, which should make its way to Congress in the next few weeks. Additionally, as the administration modifies its fiscal year 2018 budget request, they are without a predictable base on which to build. There is very little margin of error, given the few legislative days remaining before the continuing resolution expires on April 28. I, and I believe the chairman, do not view that date as another point for negotiation. It is an absolute deadline, and the value of this bill and every other appropriations bill diminishes the day they are not enacted. b1545 In closing, I again appreciate the leadership and the management of this wonderful work by our chairman, Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN . Going forward, I will work hard with the chairman. I will work hard with Chairwoman GRANGER , with Ranking Member LOWEY , and the other members of our full committee to return the appropriations process to its normal schedule. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER ), chairwoman of the Defense Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1301, the FY17 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. The world is more dangerous and unstable than any time in recent history. The U.S. and our allies face constant threats from countries including Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea. ISIS and other global terrorists threaten our very way of life. Our number one responsibility as Members of Congress is to provide for the defense of this Nation. I commend Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for the outstanding job he did drafting the FY17 bill. He deserves our thanks for producing such a significant and meaningful bill. Since becoming the chairwoman of the Defense Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, I have spent a lot of time talking to senior defense leaders to find out what they need to combat these threats. They have unanimously stated that the only thing our adversaries respect is strength, and they need this bill passed to ensure our military is as strong and effective as possible. Sequestration and reduced budget requests have caused the military to be underfunded for too long. This bill begins a process of rebuilding our military and giving our warfighters the resources they need to counter the numerous complex threats around the world. This bill reverses the drawdown of end strength and instead increases it by 36,000 troops above the FY17 budget request. This bill reverses steep cuts to procurement by funding additional ships and aircraft to modernize our weapons systems and address shortfalls. This is important because we have the smallest number of ships in the Navy since 1916, and the average age of an Air Force aircraft is 27 years old. Marine aviation squadrons have been forced to salvage parts from museums in order to keep our planes flying. In every meeting I have had with defense leadership, they emphasize the devastating impact both sequestration and operating under a continuing resolution have on our security. When asked about the impact of a full year CR, General Goldfein, chief of staff of the Air Force, said: ‘‘There is no enemy on the planet that can do more damage to the United States Air Force than us not getting a budget.’’ Our military is counting on us to pass this bill now. It is the only way to ensure the United States will be strong and able to lead in this very dangerous world. I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ), the ranking member of the full committee. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , Chairwoman GRANGER , and Ranking Member VISCLOSKY for their hard work and cooperation. Today’s bill is the product of good faith bipartisan and bicameral negotiation. Each Member of this body will need to determine whether positive aspects of this bill outweigh uncertainty about the prospects of 10 other critical funding bills languishing without a clear path forward. Unlike the Defense Appropriations bill passed by the House last June, this bill keeps faith with existing caps on discretionary spending. It does not use a budget gimmick to create a midyear shortfall in funding, which would have affected salaries and mission support for men and women serving bravely in harm’s way. I thank the chairman for increasing cybersecurity operations by nearly $1 billion; fully funding the European Reassurance Initiative in response to Russian aggression; investing in the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance resources combatant commanders clamor for; and assisting men and women in uniform by increasing pay by 2.1 percent, adding $25 million for sexual assault prevention and response, and providing $33.8 billion for the Defense Health Program. Despite these positive attributes, I would be remiss not to remind this body that the 2017 appropriations process can be described as nothing but a failure that continues to this day, more than 5 months into the fiscal year. The Defense bill that we consider today could have and should have been finished in September 2016. The majority chose to punt the deadline for this and 10 other appropriations bills until April for entirely political reasons. All Americans know we must ensure our Armed Forces are staffed, trained, and equipped to meet the challenges they face. We must fulfill that responsibility without neglecting the critical services and investments funded through the 10 other unfinished appropriations bills. I am very concerned that the House Republican leadership is proposing to 
move one bill forward without any indication that the other 10 will see the light of day. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ), the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding time and commend him for his continuing leadership on national security. I also thank the chairwoman of this subcommittee, Ms. GRANGER , and the ranking member, Mr. VISCLOSKY , for their continuing work on national security. Mr. Speaker, it is important that we pass this bill now. The Department of Defense is currently operating under a continuing resolution, which means you have got to spend the same money this year that you spent last year, and you have to spend it on the same things. Even if you don’t need to spend money on something this year that you spent last year, you have to. So it is wasteful. But you also can’t spend money on new things, even though new threats arise. It is not good for any part of government. It is particularly bad for the Department of Defense. It is important to pass this bill now to remove this continuing resolution and have a regular appropriation bill. Secondly, this bill is consistent with the Defense Authorization Conference Report which passed this House in December. All but four Republicans and all but 30 Democrats in the House voted for that measure in December. This is very consistent with that, and I hope it gets at least as much support as that bill did in December. There are a few differences. We are further into the fiscal year, so the committee was able to fund some additional priorities that were in the Housepassed authorization bill that we were not able to put in the conference report. I just think it is important for all of us to remember, Mr. Speaker, that the only answer to some of the readiness problems we are facing is modernization. We have had testimony that it takes twice as long to maintain an old F–18 aircraft, for example, as it does a new one. Well, this bill has some additional F–18s, and that is good for the pilots, good for the services that receive them. It also frees up maintenance to work on other things. Finally, it is important also to remember that this bill is just a first step in repairing and rebuilding the military. I am afraid all of us have underestimated the deep damage that has been done through sequestration, budget cuts, and a high tempo of operations. Just yesterday, I was out at Fort Campbell to see some of this and hear about some of this firsthand from the Army. This is an important essential first step, but shortly we should receive a supplemental appropriation to do more of the work of repair, and then we need to move toward an FY18 bill that really begins the rebuilding that, I think, on a bipartisan basis, most all of us in this Chamber would support. Remember, Mr. Speaker, the first job of the Federal Government is to defend the country. This is an important first step to help us fulfill that responsibility. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ), who is a member of the Subcommittee on Defense. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2017. Last year, I was unable to vote for this legislation, but the bill before us today is improved, and it is one that I can support. I was unable to vote for the previous bill because it included budget gimmicks that would have jeopardized a full year of funding for our troops and threatened readiness. I am very pleased to see this problem has been resolved. This bill provides the funding for the remainder of the 2017 fiscal year without breaking the budget caps. It also includes a muchneeded pay raise for our servicemembers and ensures that they will have the equipment that they need to complete their missions and come home. What is disappointing is that we are voting on this legislation today, halfway through the fiscal year. This work should have been finished months ago. Instead, a stalled appropriations process has left the Defense Department and our troops operating under a damaging continuing resolution. Right now it doesn’t appear that the FY18 process will go any smoother. President Trump’s proposed $54 billion increase for defense will come at the expense of essential domestic programs that our servicemen and women and their families depend upon: education for their children, quality healthcare for their families, safe roads to drive on, protection of our clean air and drinking water. The list goes on and on. Mr. Speaker, I am voting for this bill today, but I want to make it clear that I am very concerned about President Trump’s proposed cuts that would pit our national security against the domestic needs of all Americans. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS), my predecessor. He is a member of the Subcommittee on Defense of the Committee on Appropriations and a chairman in his own right. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman on his assumption of the chairmanship of the full committee and for putting this bill together when he chaired the Subcommittee on Defense. This bill certainly represents the outcome of many hard choices. It prioritizes funding where our troops need it the most. It wisely invests in readiness, training, maintenance, and procurement, and ensures that our troops are prepared for the tasks before them. This bill also supports our efforts to defeat ISIL alongside our allies in the region as well as our continued focus on deterring Russian aggression. I am also pleased, Mr. Speaker, that this bill takes care of the troops and their families, granting them a long awaited 2.1 percent pay raise. Time and again, our servicemembers put themselves in harm’s way and respond to the myriad threats facing the Nation. This pay raise is one small way for us to honor their dedication and willingness to serve. As the threats we face continue to become more unpredictable, we must provide our troops with the tools that they need to win in uncertain times. This bill goes a long way toward restoring the shortfalls in manpower and readiness that our military has endured in recent years. In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me call attention again to Will Smith, who has been a clerk of this committee for 6 years and served as my chief of staff in my private office for many years before. This is likely his last appropriations bill on the floor to help manage and put together, and so I want to say to Will and all of you in behalf of saying something good about Will, what a great amount of service he rendered the Nation with a true Kentucky attitude, which he has. Will, we owe you a lot. Thank you for your service. You have been great. We wish you Godspeed. b1600 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I would simply follow up on the chairman’s remarks, and I also want to congratulate Mr. Smith on his life of service to his country. Mr. Pomerantz on our side was also mentioned. Again, both gentlemen and their service to this country are a reflection on public service, and I appreciate it very much on behalf of all of us in this Chamber. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER ), who is also a member of the Defense Subcommittee. Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. I thank Chairwoman GRANGER and Ranking Member VISCLOSKY for bringing this bill to the floor. This bill helps to close gaps in readiness while making investments in research and development. These investments are critically important because I guarantee our adversaries know where we have work to do. Mr. Speaker, I represent a congressional district home to two Army bases, the NSA, several National Guard facilities, and dozens of our private sector partners. I serve on the board of the United States Naval Academy, and I cochair the Army Caucus. My experience tells me we are living in a world that has changed since our Armed Forces entered the Middle East 16 years ago. While our men and women 
in uniform fought asymmetric foes, our nearpeer adversaries such as Russia and China made advancements in technology that threaten to degrade our military qualitative advantage. This appropriations bill ensures our troops are ready and that we have enough of them to get the job done. It fully funds the new end strength number and allows for a 2.1 percent pay raise for our troops. This is the least we can do for the brave men and women who sacrifice for our country. This bill also deters Russian aggression by fully funding the European Reassurance Initiative, and makes critical investments in missile defense technology. This bill is a solid start, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support it, but there is still work to be done. Our troops should trust that elected officials will support them and do their job to fund the government, just as we trust them to accomplish the mission assigned to them. BandAid budgets are bad for everyone—our partners in industry, the American taxpayers, and especially our Armed Forces. Now is not the time to argue over partisan issues. Congress should create a frontline of support for our Armed Forces that is just as strong as the frontline our soldiers have created to protect us. I call on all of my colleagues to work in a bipartisan fashion to pass this and the other FY17 appropriation bills as quickly as possible. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that we are here hoping to end the continuing resolution on the Department of Defense, and I rise in support of the bill we are debating today. We all know too well that continuing resolutions are unacceptable burdens on the least and the greatest of our DOD assets, our Members, and civilians at a time of unprecedented threats to our Nation. I thank Chairman FRELING HUYSEN and Chairwoman G RANGER for bringing this bill to the floor and for their unwavering commitment to the men and women in uniform, which will continue under their leadership in the future. I also thank this committee for fully funding an increase of Active, Guard, and Reserve soldiers. I am also cochair of the Army Caucus, and providing them with the modern equipment and training necessary to keep them alive and the greatest fighting force on Earth is very important to the defense of our Nation. We have more that we need to consider. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Army Vice Chief of Staff Daniel Allyn recently told the House Armed Services Committee that our Army requires modernization equipment to win decisively, but today we are outraged, outgunned, and outdated. At the present time, he says that only three of the Army’s 58 brigade combat teams are ready to fight. It is crucial, and I urge my colleagues to support this appropriations bill and fully fund our armed services. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), who is a member of the full Appropriations Committee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Mr. VISCLOSKY for yielding. I also thank him for his tremendous leadership as our ranking member, and giving us all an opportunity to really voice our opinions and put our points of view forward in a very fair way. I rise in opposition to this bill, however. I offered two amendments to this bill, the fiscal year 2017 Defense Appropriations bill, and I am really disappointed to once again see that my amendments were not made in order. I want to explain these two amendments because this is the only chance that we will have to talk about this. The first amendment, which I have offered several times on a bipartisan basis, would prohibit the funding for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, the AUMF, beginning on September 30, 2017. And mind you, that 6month window provides Congress ample opportunity to draft and debate a new AUMF and to vote it up or down. Clearly, Congress is required to act. This amendment would require Congress to finally debate and vote on nearly a 3yearlong war that is raging in the Middle East, a war that has already claimed the lives of several brave servicemembers. The House simply cannot continue to abdicate its constitutional responsibility to give the American people a voice in matters of war and peace. I offered another amendment, which would prohibit funding for United States combat troops in Syria. Mr. Speaker, this amendment was really simple, but, once again, I am sad to say that it was not made in order. This amendment would use the power of the purse to prevent funding for combat operations in Syria, unless the purpose is to rescue or protect members of the Armed Forces from danger. We can all agree that ISIL must be degraded and dismantled, but Congress continues to be missing in action from this debate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. LEE. We know that the 2001 authorization was specific to 9/11. And I voted against it because I knew it would be broadly interpreted, which it has been. Sadly, it is a blank check for war. Actually, the Congressional Research Service provided us a declassified report saying—and this was last year—it had been used over 35 times. Nothing related to 9/11. So this blank check needs to be repealed. We also know that ISIL didn’t even exist in 2001. Every day, more bombs fall and the battlefield expands. We have already spent billions of dollars against this unauthorized war. Congress needs to show up for work, muster its courage, exercise its constitutional responsibility for debate, and vote on the ongoing war in Iraq and Syria. We owe nothing less to our brave men and women who are in harm’s way. It is past time to force a debate and vote on this issue. Hopefully, one day we will make these amendments in order and, hopefully, we will have bipartisan support to just move forward and do our job as Members of Congress, which is what the Constitution requires. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZ BALART ), and thank him for his service on the Defense Appropriations Committee. Mr. DIAZBALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. I want to first start by commending the chairman of the full committee and the former chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN , for his unwavering commitment to the men and women in uniform, and also for bringing this great bill forward. I also want to recognize the good work and leadership of the new subcommittee chairwoman, that titanium Texan, Ms. GRANGER . Mr. Speaker, I have to also mention the ranking members, Mrs. LOWEY and Mr. VISCLOSKY , because this, frankly, is a partnership in allowing this bill to come forward. Mr. Speaker, with this bill, Congress fulfills what I believe is an essential part of what we are here to do and what government’s essential role is—to provide for the common defense. This bill is essential for the men and women who serve our Nation with distinction in the military. This bill funds a 2.1 percent pay raise for the military, something that they so deserve. It also targets resources for the health care for our servicemembers and their family members. Throughout the year—and you have already heard it—we have heard testimony time and time again from our service chiefs about the necessity to address our military’s alarming readiness shortfalls. This bill, Mr. Speaker, addresses the readiness problems that are making it more and more difficult for our troops. We devote resources to prepare our troops both for combat and peacetime missions, including flight time and training, to ensure that we maintain our military superiority. Lastly, this bill provides the necessary essential equipment, weapon systems, and platforms needed to 
maintain and sustain our essential military superiority, whether it is in the air, in the sea, or on the ground. Mr. Speaker, I would just end with what I mentioned before: I believe the principal job of the Federal Government is to defend and protect our country. The Defense Appropriations bill before us does just that, and it deserves all of our support. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member VISCLOSKY very much. Mr. Speaker, every year, our top responsibility as appropriators is to finish the 12 spending bills that keep our government running by October 1 of the year before that fiscal year is supposed to start. But here we are today, March 8, halfway into fiscal year 2017, finally voting on a compromise bill that closely reflects the request the last administration delivered to us 1 year ago February. Our service chiefs and Secretaries present a consistent, clear message to Congress. They have pleaded for stability and predictability in the budget so they could ensure complete readiness of America’s forces. Force readiness remains the defense community’s top priority. Funding the capabilities to provide this responsibility must remain our top priority. We must approach Congress’ appropriations responsibility from the historic bipartisan process that has broken down once too many times in recent years. This political infighting harms the stability and predictability necessary for our Armed Forces to properly plan. It left both our adversaries and allies questioning our ability to defend or support the multiple conflicts we are currently engaged with abroad. This compromise worked out by our responsible colleagues, Chairwoman GRANGER , Chairman F RELINGHUYSEN , Ranking Member VISCLOSKY , Ranking Member LOWEY ; and their Senate counterparts are strong glimmers of hope that we might actually finish the 2017 appropriations responsibilities. But we have ten additional subcommittee bills that are equally important and account for nearly half of our budget. When will we vote on those compromised bills? I could think of little that would be more irresponsible than to only move this defense bill and leave the remaining departments and agencies operating under a continuing resolution. I have always supported our troops and our national defense. However, we know the safety and wellbeing of the American people does not merely rely on defense funding. It is rooted in the stability of the Republic they are sworn to protect and defend. We have a responsibility there, equally important. Our financial commitments to energy independence, critical infrastructure, homeland security, funding for first responders, teachers, and healthcare programs are equally necessary to increase America’s security at home and abroad. I hope my colleagues alleviate this concern and quickly package the remaining bills for a vote, as the American people so richly deserve. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK ), and I thank him for his great contributions to the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations. b1615 Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I consider it one of the great honors in Congress to serve on the Defense Appropriations Committee with some real champions for national security: guys like RODNEY FRELINGHUYSEN , the overall chairman; Chairwoman KAY GRANGER from the Defense Subcommittee; my friend PETEVISCLOSKY , the ranking member. These are all people that have a heart and a soul for what we are trying to do here today, and that is to provide for the common defense. It is our constitutional duty. And guys like MACTHORNBERRY , the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. A lot of champions here that believe in a strong national defense. Mr. Speaker, not only does this bill rebuild readiness by giving our troops the equipment they need, but it also reverses Obamaera cuts to the developing defense platforms, stops troop drawdowns, and perhaps most importantly, gives our warfighters a much deserved pay raise. As a 30year veteran of the Arkansas Army National Guard, I am particularly pleased that this bill provides the funding necessary to ensure the National Guard remains a fully operational force. It is a good bill, Mr. Speaker, and with a willing partner in the White House and a pledge to rebuild our military, it marks the first step, an important first step our Congress has to take to complete our business from last year; and it gives our defenders what they need and deserve, and that is certainty. Threats are growing. America must project strength. That starts with creating a military so strong that we never send our men and women downrange in a fair fight. I call on my colleagues to stand strong against our enemies. Take this first step today in projecting power with our financial commitment. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the bill. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY), a new member of the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership of Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN at the full committee and Chairwoman GRANGER at the Defense Subcommittee on this bill. Providing for the common defense of our Nation is one of the most fundamental duties of Congress under the Constitution. Last week I appreciated the message that President Trump delivered in his joint session address, and I was particularly encouraged by his call to properly fund our military. For the last 6 years, we have been in almost constant tension with an administration whose sequestration policy threatened to hollow out our military. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I stand ready to work with the President and Secretary Mattis to make sure our military is properly funded, well equipped, and ready for the fight. That is why I am so proud to support this Defense Appropriations bill. Our bill rejects the Obama administration’s proposed troop level reductions that would have amounted to as many as 36,000 servicemen and women cut from the ranks. Instead, our bill provides funding for an additional 1,000 ActiveDuty Army soldiers, 1,000 Army National Guard soldiers, 1,000 Army Reserve soldiers, and 1,000 ActiveDuty marines. The bill also fully funds a muchdeserved 2.1 percent pay raise for military personnel. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a district that is home to both Fort Rucker, the home of Army aviation, and MaxwellGunter Air Force Base, the intellectual center of the Air Force. I am pleased to report that this bill contains a strong budget for Army aviation, including $187 million for the 28 Lakota helicopters, which are the primary aircraft used for training at Fort Rucker. It also contains an increase of almost $450 million for the Air Force’s cybersecurity efforts. Maxwell’s Air Force Cyber College at Air University plays a key part in cybersecurity, serving as an intellectual hub for the Air Force in the emerging battlefield for cyber warfare. This appropriations bill also contains funding for the procurement of 74 F–35 Joint Strike Fighters. The Montgomerybased 187th Fighter Wing is on the short list for being assigned this next generation fighter jet, and our Alabama congressional delegation is working together to make the case to the Air Force why this special unit is an ideal fit. Mr. Speaker, I take our responsibility to craft sound military spending plans very seriously. I am pleased the House is moving the fiscal year 2017 Defense Appropriations bill this week, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ). He is a great member of the full committee. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you to 
Mr. F RELINGHUYSEN for the outstanding work and effort that he has put into this critically important piece of legislation, and I thank Chairwoman GRANGER for her strong support in advancing this muchneeded legislation. The people before me have talked so eloquently about our responsibility as Members of Congress to defend and protect our Nation. We have talked about national security. We have talked about troops. We have talked about battling terrorism. And that is what this bill does. I want to take a slightly different approach and say something about what this bill does in all of our communities, not just distant lands around the world, but in our home communities. I want to highlight one area that will make a real difference in all of our communities, and that is the National Guard’s Counterdrug Program. This program is essential in detecting, disrupting, and curtailing drug trafficking. It provides resources to almost every State and territory to help train personnel and run counterdrug missions. The National Guard supports almost 60,000 requests a year for assistance from local law enforcement agencies. In fiscal year 2014, National Guard counterdrug programs took almost $12 billion in illegal drugs off the street. This minor investment is paying major dividends. During NDAA consideration, I helped secure an amendment to increase funding for this account by $30 million because this program works. This legislation under consideration today also increases funding for this vital program by $135 million more than the amount requested by then President Obama. This is a critical moment in combating the drug crisis, and we must fully fund every program that will help us solve it. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. PALAZZO ), a great member of the full committee. Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for the time. I rise today in strong support of the fiscal year 2017 Defense Appropriations bill. I have long said that the number one constitutional responsibility of this body is the common defense of this Nation, and today, the Appropriations Committee, under the leadership of Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , has once again shown the importance that we place on this most sacred duty. After years of weak budget requests from our prior administration, this bill contains over $5.2 billion over the 2016 level and $1.5 billion more than the Obama administration’s request. Included in this appropriations bill is the funding of 10 new ships for our Navy, including an LPD, essential to our Marine Corps mission, as well as 3 destroyers, 2 Virginia class submarines, 3 LCSs, and an LHA, all ships desperately needed by our Navy and Marine Corps. Funding these ships steadily is not only a key to keeping our military strong, but also keeps our industrial base healthy and keeps these ships affordable in the long run. Finally, this appropriations bill takes the first steps toward rebuilding our military, showing our allies that they can trust us, and showing our enemies they should fear us. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work and his staff’s work on this fine bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I will end where I began, and that is because I think this will be the last time that the chair and I manage a Defense Appropriations bill together on the floor. It has been a delightful relationship, and I look forward to it continuing as you are chairman of the full committee. Again, I thank the staff and look forward to working with Chairwoman GRANGER , and I also ask my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FY2017 Defense Appropriations bill. I commend Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , Ranking Member LOWEY , our new Chairwoman GRANGER and Ranking Member V ISCLOSKY for their leadership on this bill. I would also like to thank our dedicated professional staff who have tirelessly worked on this agreement. I have served on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for many years and providing for our men and women in uniform is a privilege and an honor. This bill provides vital funding for our Armed Services, including a 2.1 percent pay raise and additional funding for increased end strength. As many of us have noted, our military is in a precarious position, and this bill is an important first step to rebuild and restore our military strength. It provides funding for necessary shipbuilding; aircraft and vehicle procurement; and important research and development to maintain our technological superiority. The bill also provides vital Operations and Maintenance funding for facility sustainment, restoration, and modernization programs. I look forward to working with the new Administration and providing the resources our military needs to maintain our position in the world as well as continue to invest in our most important asset—the men and women our United States Armed Forces.

REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 720, LAWSUIT ABUSE REDUCTION ACT OF 2017, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 985, FAIRNESS IN CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–29) on the resolution (H. Res. 180) providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 720) to amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to improve attorney accountability, and for other purposes, and providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 985) to amend the procedures used in Federal court class actions and multidistrict litigation proceedings to assure fairer, more efficient outcomes for claimants and defendants, and for other purposes, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 132, as the gentleman from Florida just mentioned, would allow a title transfer of two Federal buildings to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in southcentral Oklahoma. These are buildings that were part of the Arbuckle Project, which is a water project authorized by Congress back in 1962 to provide flood control, recreational opportunities, and municipal water supply. Nearly all the facilities within this project were already transferred to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in 2012, after the district finish repaying what it owed to the Federal Government for construction. However, due to some overly narrow language in the legislation authorizing this project, two buildings have yet to be transferred. Transferring them will save taxpayers money that would otherwise be 
needed to operate and maintain these buildings. It will also relieve the Federal Government of any potential future liability associated with these buildings. It is a straightforward bill that should be quickly passed. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE). Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend for yielding. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I had no idea there was such interest in the Arbuckle watershed, but I am flattered and pleased that all of you are here for this important legislation. I rise in support H.R. 132, the Arbuckle Project Maintenance Complex and District Office Conveyance Act. This bill is straightforward. As has been mentioned, it is a land conveyance which has both Federal and local support. I would like to remind my colleagues this legislation was passed in the 114th Congress on December 7, 2016, by a vote of 412–1. Clearly, it was so good, everybody wanted it back again. H.R. 132 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain lands and buildings of the Arbuckle Project in Murray County, Oklahoma, to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District. In 1962, Congress authorized the payment of reimbursable costs for construction, operation, and maintenance of the Bureau of Reclamation’s Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in southcentral Oklahoma. The district completed repayment of the capital costs of the project in September of 2012. In accordance with the Bureau of Reclamation’s policy framework for title transfer, in December 2014, the Bureau of Reclamation and the district executed an agreement to transfer, in fee title, certain facilities that could be more effectively and efficiently managed at the local level. The title transfer involves approximately 2.83 acres of land. On this land is a small house, associated structures, and the conservancy district’s headquarters office building. The house and property are used to accommodate a district employee who maintains and inspects the dam and the pumping facilities. The headquarters office building is the base of operation for the district. This bill also divests the Federal Government of its responsibility and liability associated with the district’s facilities. Reclamation and the district have worked cooperatively and successfully to address all of the elements necessary to bring this legislation forward and make this transfer proceed as smoothly as possible. I am pleased this bill is an agreement in which both the Federal and local interests are satisfied. I want to urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation once again. I want to again thank the chairman for his help in expediting this matter. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, is it consistent with the rules of the House of Representatives for the Committee on Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce Committee to be considering the American Health Care Act without a CBO score that would permit us to know how much this legislation will cost? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is asking the Chair a hypothetical question that is not pertinent to the business currently before the House. Mr. RASKIN. Well, I didn’t think it was hypothetical. I move that the House do now adjourn. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman first yield back the time he was yielded for debate? Mr. RASKIN. Yes, I will. 
MOTION TO ADJOURN Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to adjourn offered by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 314, nays 98, not voting 17, as follows:
