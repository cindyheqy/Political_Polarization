Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Mr. Howard Marshall, former Deputy Assistant Director at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Marshall recently concluded a 21 year career with the FBI, this after growing up in a household where his father, Brian, a resident of my district, was a special agent for 33 years. The Marshall family is visiting us in Washington, D.C., in the historic Capitol today. During the early stages, Mr. Marshall worked in St. Louis, Memphis, as well as the FBI headquarters, where he worked on multiple task forces and supervised a public corruption squad. In 2008, Mr. Marshall was promoted to FBI leadership as Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Dallas division, where he managed the whitecollar crime and intelligence programs. After Dallas, he was promoted to the Inspection Division, where he led inspections of local field offices, as well as shooting incident review teams. Mr. Marshall was then appointed Special Agent in Charge in Louisville. Recently, Mr. Marshall served as the Deputy Assistant Director of the Cyber Division, where he supported the mission to identify and defeat cyber threats targeting U.S. interests. Prior to the FBI, Mr. Marshall worked for the Prosecuting Attorney’s Office in Little Rock, Arkansas. We thank Mr. Marshall and his father, Brian, for their combined 54 years of public service to the American people and their service to the FBI, and all their fellow agents at the Bureau. f 
RECOGNITION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Northern California Power Agency, which is celebrating 50 years of service this year. Back in 1968, a group of municipal electric utilities, including the city of Lodi in my district, joined together to form the NCPA. The NCPA continues to harness the power of clean energy today. For 50 years, NCPA has utilized new technologies to provide clean, renewable energy for its consumerowners. This includes the Lodi Energy Center, a faststart, combinedcycle natural gas project. The NCPA’s commitments to innovation and clean power have made significant contributions to their California member communities, resulting in low electric rates and CO2free generation. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the NCPA and its members on 50 years of service, achievement, and success. 
PASS A FARM BILL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, 6 years ago, farmers and ranchers across Kansas faced drought conditions that crippled crops, dried ponds, and forced livestock owners to abandon pastures. In the years since, rain has fallen and conditions returned to normal, but drought conditions have once again struck Kansas, leaving many counties across my district dry and worried. Ranchers in the Flint Hills of Kansas are finding themselves short of water and grass for their cattle, while farmers in central Kansas watch corn and soybean plants shrivel under the unrelenting heat. Some counties are nearly 15 inches behind normal rainfall totals, with many under extreme drought declaration. All of this on top of low commodity prices and market uncertainty strains operating budgets and pushes farmer suicide rates to more than double that of the general population. That is right, Mr. Speaker, our farmer suicide rates are more than double that of the general population. Unfortunately, the impacts do not stop at the farm gate. When production agriculture suffers, so do the communities our producers call home and the 
companies that support the agriculture industry. The drought really does impact us all. Earlier this month, I visited Connie and Joe Mushrush’s Red Angus Ranch in Chase County, Kansas. They showed me their vacant pastures and dry ponds, and admitted this drought was one of the worst their family has ever endured. They are not alone, as I hear stories of farmers and ranchers all across the district struggling to find solutions and options for their crops and cattle. While I cannot deliver the rain many of us pray for, I can help to bring a level of certainty and support to my farmers and ranchers through final passage of the 2018 farm bill. I have worked hard, alongside my Agriculture Committee colleagues, to write and pass legislation that continues crop insurance and conservation programs that help producers operate their farms and ranches more efficiently. Farmers never want a handout, but in trying times like these, it is essential that we support those who put food on our table with a safety net that we can all count on. I will continue to do all I can to support my farmers and ranchers, and I ask that my colleagues say a prayer for rain and for the men and women who feed us all. 
74TH ANNIVERSARY OF LIBERATION OF GUAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 74th anniversary of the liberation of Guam during World War II. This morning, I just came from Arlington National Cemetery, where Ms. Irene Sgambelluri, a survivor of the occupation of Guam, joined me and Congressman SABLAN in laying a memorial wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Sgambelluri is a dear friend of mine who happens to be in the audience today in the gallery. I was honored to host her here in our Nation’s Capital for this solemn anniversary. The Chamorro people of Guam endured 32 months of occupation and wartime atrocities, with thousands of our island’s finest murdered, brutalized, and forced into concentration camps. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Sgambelluri’s father was taken by the Japanese, and she was later forced into a concentration camp for the remainder of the war. Today, I introduced the Occupation of Guam Remembrance Act in recognition of the atrocities endured by the Chamorro people of Guam during World War II. We must never, ever forget the sacrifices made by our island’s manamko—the elders—during the war. My Occupation of Guam Remembrance Act will ensure that all those victims and survivors who submitted for war claims will have their names inscribed on the memorial wall at the Asan Bay Overlook in the War in the Pacific National Historic Park. The memorial wall is the only national monument dedicated to the sacrifices of Guam’s Chamorro people during World War II, as well as the American servicemen and insular guardsmen who died defending the island during the war and those who liberated Guam in the summer of 1944. Ms. Sgambelluri is just one of thousands who lived out that dark chapter in American history. I thank her for her friendship and for representing the thousands of war victims and survivors at this year’s wreath laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. Guam’s greatest generation, our manamko, or elders, who endured the war and survived have much to teach us. With the Occupation of Guam Remembrance Act, and the addition of all war claimants to the memorial wall, future generations will see the names of all those who sacrificed dearly for Guam and our future. The victims and survivors of the occupation of Guam are in my prayers today, and I hope that all my colleagues here in Congress will join me in honoring the sacrifices of these very great Americans. God bless Guam and God bless the United States of America. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members that the rules do not allow for references to occupants of the gallery. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 10 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Bless the Members of this people’s House with wisdom and the courage to address the pressing difficulties of our time. As they continue the work of this assembly, guide them to grow in understanding in attaining solutions to our Nation’s needs. Continue to bless as well those charged with protecting and serving our country. They, too, need wisdom and insight into the pressure points of insecurity among our citizens. Lord, have mercy. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
KAVANAUGH THE RIGHT CHOICE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, has provided a thoughtful editorial supporting the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. The editorial reinforces that ‘‘Brett Kavanaugh is a highly qualified ‘originalist’ who will help return the Supreme Court to its proper function in American society. The Senate should quickly confirm him.’’ ‘‘Judge Kavanaugh . . . fits President Donald Trump’s promise to appoint judges known to adhere to the original language of the Constitution and its amendments, and to closely follow the law as laid down by Congress.’’ ‘‘As a Federal judge, Mr. Kavanaugh appears to have taken the . . . view that Congress is the preeminent policymaking body of the Federal government except where the Constitution gives policymaking powers to the executive; that Congress, the executive branch and the judiciary are all bound by the Constitution . . . and that judges and the President are further bound by the permissible decisions of Congress.’’ ‘‘It would be a welcome change to see the court allow the political branches of government to decide most political questions rather than the court.’’ In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
SUPPORT FOR OUR NATIONAL PARKS (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, our Nation’s national parks are a cherished part of our country’s legacy, and it is critical 
that they be preserved for generations to come. Unfortunately, the National Park Service is facing an insurmountable backlog of deferred maintenance that is growing more urgent as decadesold agency structures reach the end of their anticipated lifespans. This is impacting some of our most beloved parks. The Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia is the country’s second most visited National Park, supporting approximately 15,600 jobs and is a huge economic asset to nearby rural communities. Deferred maintenance has resulted in the unfortunate deterioration of its amenities and accessibility. The National Park Service Legacy Act would establish a National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund directly aimed at addressing the agency’s backlog and fixing the issues facing the Blue Ridge Parkway. As a proud cosponsor of this innovative legislation, I encourage its vote and final passage in the House this Congress. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 3 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 4 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1501 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. CURTIS ) at 3 o’clock and 1 minute p.m.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1376, the Electronic Message Preservation Act of 2017, introduced by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ), the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The Electronic Message Preservation Act of 2017 will ensure the Federal Government continues to take the necessary steps to modernize its recordkeeping. Despite the significant shift to electronic communications over the last two decades, many Federal agencies are just now moving away from a printtofile method of electronic record preservation. Using paper to preserve electronic records is inefficient, difficult to manage, difficult to search, and risks loss of the records. Paperbased systems can also increase the cost to the taxpayer. At the end of 2016, the Office of Management and Budget began requiring agencies to preserve records electronically if they were created electronically. This bill codifies that requirement. This bill ensures agencies will continue to electronically manage their records, where possible, and closes gaps in current law. H.R. 1376 also requires electronic Presidential records be held to the same archival standards as those of executive agencies. I would like to thank the gentleman from Maryland for his work on this important issue this Congress and in the previous Congress. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Electronic Message Preservation Act of 2017, and I want to thank Mr. GOWDY , our chairman, for getting this bill to the floor as he has today. I introduced this bill with the goal of modernizing the Federal and Presidential Records Acts. This bill would require the Archivist of the United States to issue regulations mandating that all Federal agencies manage and preserve their email records electronically. This bill would help ensure that email records from Federal agencies and the White House are preserved. According to an October 2017 report from the National Archives and Records Administration, approximately 46 percent of agencies continue to print and file paper copies of email messages. These records are more likely to get lost and are harder for agencies to retrieve during record searches under the Freedom of Information Act. This bill would put into statute what agencies are already required to do under a directive issued by the Archivist and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. In 2016, the National Archives issued a document for agency records officers titled: ‘‘Why Agencies Need to Move Toward Electronic Recordkeeping.’’ The document identified a number of reasons, including longterm cost savings, information security, and more efficient and effective implementation of the Freedom of Information Act. This bill also would require the Archivist to establish standards for the preservation and management of email records that are Presidential records and to certify annually that the White House has records management controls in place that meet those standards. Under this bill, the Archivist must report 1 year after a President leaves office on whether the controls used by the President met the required standards. This legislation would provide accountability to encourage every President to have the controls in place that are necessary to preserve emails and other electronic records. This bill has been passed by the House with bipartisan support several times before. I urge my colleagues to support the bill again today, and I hope that the Senate will act on the bill and send it to the President’s desk before the end of the year. Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from North Carolina and I have laid out very nicely exactly and eloquently what this bill is all about. It is very important that we modernize all of our systems in the Federal Government, and recordkeeping is so important. We see it, particularly in our committee, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, because we are constantly trying to get records and requesting records and occasionally subpoenaing records. So this is a way, I believe, to make that whole process more effective, efficient, and transparent. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1376. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
GOOD ACCOUNTING OBLIGATION IN GOVERNMENT ACT Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5415) to require agencies to submit reports on outstanding recommendations in the annual budget justification submitted to Congress, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5415 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

(B) With respect to a public recommendation for corrective action from the Office of Inspector General of the agency— (i) for which the agency has taken action not recommended and considers closed, an explanation of the reason why the agency took different action with respect to each audit report to which the public recommendation for corrective action pertains; and (ii) for which no final action has been taken, an explanation of the reasons why no final action was taken with respect to each audit report to which the public recommendation for corrective action pertains. (C) With respect to an outstanding unimplemented public recommendation from the Office of Inspector General of the agency that the agency has decided to adopt, a timeline for implementation. (4) An explanation for any discrepancy between— (A) the most recent semiannual report submitted by the Inspector General of the agency and the report submitted under paragraphs (2) and (3); and (B) any report submitted by the Government Accountability Office relating to public recommendations that are designated by the Government Accountability Office as ‘‘open’’ or ‘‘closed, unimplemented’’ and any report submitted under paragraph (1) and (2). (b) ADDITIONAL REPORT REQUIREMENTS FOR  CERTAIN AGENCIES .—The head of a covered agency shall include in the annual budget justification described in subsection (a) a written response to each recommendation designated by the Comptroller in the annual priority recommendation letter sent to such head as high priority for attention by that head.

(3) SEMIANNUAL REPORT .—The term ‘‘semiannual report’’ means the semiannual report submitted to Congress by each Inspector General under section 5 of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.). 
No additional funds are authorized to carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5415, the GAOIG Act. The Government Accountability Office and inspectors general are two of the best sources for recommendations to improve the operations of the Federal Government. Their efforts help fight waste, fraud, and abuse; promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness within the executive branch; and save taxpayer dollars. GAO and inspector general audits and investigations often end with corrective recommendations to the agency reviewed. As of May 2018, the GAO has issued more than 1,500 products with about 4,800 open recommendations. Since 2014, IGs have issued over 8,900 reports, with approximately 40,300 total recommendations. During that same time period, IGs identified over $99 billion in potential savings through their audits, investigations, and recommendations. But all of these recommendations are only as valuable as the agency’s commitment to implement them. I introduced the GAOIG Act to ensure every agency evaluates and implements recommendations by GAO and the inspector general. The bill requires agencies to include the unresolved GAO and IG recommendations within their annual budget justification to Congress. Agencies must also report on the implementation status of each recommendation and why they are not fully implemented. This creates a formal process in which agencies must take stock of their open and unimplemented recommendations each year. This increased transparency will encourage each agency to work with GAO and its inspector general to identify and implement highpriority open recommendations. I would like to thank Representatives PALMER , D UNCAN , B ISHOP , and FITZPATRICK for their cosponsorship of this legislation. I would also like to thank Chairman GOWDY and Ranking Member CUMMINGS of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for their support. The bill passed out of the committee unanimously by voice vote earlier this year. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Mr. WALKER for introducing this wellthoughtout bill and very important bill. I support this bill, which would increase the transparency and accountability of Federal agencies. The bill would require agencies to include in their budget justifications to Congress a summary of the recommendations made by GAO or the agency’s inspector general. Agencies would also be required to explain what steps they are taking to address these recommendations or, if they disagree with them, why they disagree. GAO and inspectors general provide critical oversight of the executive branch. Knowing what agencies are doing or not doing to address GAO and IG recommendations will assist Congress in conducting its constitutional oversight role. This is, indeed, a commonsense measure that I strongly support. I just want to urge the House to pass this bill. One of the things that has concerned many of us in the Congress is the issue of accountability. Accountability is so very, very important. We all have a tremendous amount of respect for the inspectors general and for GAO. Over and over again, they make recommendations, and the question becomes: Whatever happens to those recommendations? Are they placed on a shelf and never to be seen again, or are they put into place? After all, the American people are spending a lot of money with regard to the research and the investigations conducted by the IG and the research conducted by the GAO. And so, Mr. Speaker, we are very supportive of this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. b1515 Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5415, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
EXTENDING VIRGIN ISLANDS OF THE UNITED STATES CENTENNIAL COMMISSION ACT Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4446) to amend the Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial Commission Act to extend the expiration date of the Commission, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
H.R. 4446 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial Commission Act (Public Law 114–224) is amended— (1) in section 7(b), by striking ‘‘January 31, 2018’’ and inserting ‘‘January 31, 2019’’; and (2) in section 10, by striking ‘‘September 30, 2018’’ and inserting ‘‘September 30, 2019’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4446, introduced by the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ). H.R. 4446 would extend the Virgin Islands Centennial Commission by a period of 1 year. Congress established the Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial Commission to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the transfer of the Virgin Islands from Denmark to the United States. The Commission was delayed in convening. As a result, no events have been planned or carried out, and there is no final report available detailing the Commission’s recommended activities. This bill extends the life of the Commission by 1 year to give it more time to plan events celebrating this important moment in American history. The bill also delays the deadline for submitting the final report by 1 year. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on my bill, H.R. 4446, to extend the Virgin Islands Centennial Commission. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOWDY and Ranking Member C UMMINGS , House leadership, and staff for their work to bring this bill to the House floor. The Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial Commission Act was signed into law in 2016 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands of the United States becoming an unincorporated territory of the United States and to facilitate discussions and events on its relations with the territory. Since its creation, the Commission has seen the appointments of Senators LISA MURKOWSKI , B ILL NELSON , and MARCO RUBIO, Representatives T OM MACARTHUR and M IALOVE, and Assistant Secretary for Insular Areas Douglas Domenech. The Commission expires September 30, 2018, without the extension of such time. The Commission has been formed to plan, develop, and carry out such activities as the Commission considers fitting and proper to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands of the United States becoming part of the United States. The Commission also will provide advice and assistance to the Federal, State, and local governmental agencies, as well as civic groups, to carry out activities to commemorate this milestone in the movement of the Virgin Islands in its relationship with the United States. Passage of this bill would allow the Commission additional time to accomplish its mission to study specific issues related to the Virgin Islands of the United States by extending the final report termination deadlines by a year to January 31, 2019, and September 30, 2019, respectively. In June, the Centennial Commission met and selected a chair and interim executive director. We are currently in the process of collaborating with the National Museum of African American History and Culture on public programs as well as hearings here and in the Virgin Islands. The Commission is also in the process of engaging stakeholders to become involved in developing future projects to meet its goals and objectives. Last September, as we all know, the Virgin Islands faced catastrophic damage from two unprecedented backto back Category 5 hurricanes. The recovering American citizens residing on the islands would benefit greatly from continued congressional recognition, as well as the work of the Commission not only in commemorating our past, but, more importantly, talking about our future and our continued relationship with the country. This Commission has received national and international support, and an extended lifespan of the Commission would allow it to better benefit from this support and further examine the often inadequate relationship between the territory and the rest of the United States. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4446, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4446, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
WAYNE K. CURRY POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4890) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 9801 Apollo Drive in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, as the ‘‘Wayne K. Curry Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4890 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 9801 Apollo Drive in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Wayne K. Curry Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Wayne K. Curry Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4890, a bill to name the post office at 9801 Apollo Drive in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, after Wayne K. Curry. Mr. Curry was born in Brooklyn in 1951, but grew up in Cheverly, Maryland. After graduating from Western Maryland College, now McDaniel College, Curry began working for Prince George’s County while earning his law degree at night. In 1944, Wayne Curry ran and was elected to the position of county executive. Curry passed away from lung cancer on July 2, 2014, at the age of 63. He was a dedicated public servant, and we honor him today by naming a post office after him in the county in which he served. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 4890 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 9801 Apollo Drive in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, as the Wayne K. Curry Post Office Building. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN ) to tell us more about Mr. Curry. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Virgin Islands for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the committee for its consideration in support of H.R. 4890 as well as thank all the members of the Maryland delegation for their steadfast support. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4890, which designates the post office at 9801 Apollo Drive in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, in Maryland’s Fourth Congressional District the Wayne K. Curry Post Office in honor of our late county executive. Wayne Keith Curry was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in a racially segregated neighborhood in Cheverly, Maryland. His family was among the first nonWhite families to integrate the community in the early 1950s. He and his older brother were the first African American students to integrate Cheverly Tuxedo Elementary School and then Bladensburg High School. Wayne began his career in public service in the administration of Prince George’s County Executive Winfield Kelly, Jr., from 1975 to 1978. Through his vision, devotion, and tireless work ethic to make a better Prince George’s County, he quickly rose through the ranks of county government. He went on to serve in various roles, including community affairs assistant, administrative assistant to the county’s chief administrative officer, and senior assistant to the executive. Mr. Curry commuted nightly to Baltimore, eventually graduating with honors from the University of Maryland Law School, receiving his juris doctorate in 1980. From 1980 until 1983, Wayne worked as counsel for a large real estate development company in Prince George’s County, and later decided to start his own law practice in 1984. During this time, he served as general counsel for Dimensions Health Corporation, among other highprofile clients. Although he was a partner at a lucrative law firm, public service had a strong grasp on his heart. He served as chairman of the United Way Campaign of Prince George’s County, president of the Prince George’s County Chamber of Commerce, chairman of the School Superintendent’s Advisory Committee on Black Male Achievement, and chairman of the Prince George’s County Substance Abuse Advisory Board. When the opportunity presented itself, he ran for Prince George’s County executive in 1994. Running as the underdog, he ultimately prevailed. He made history when he became the first African American to serve in the county’s highest elected office. He brought a renewed vitality to the office and focused his administration on the economic empowerment of his constituents. The transformation of Prince George’s County reflected Wayne Curry’s own life from a sleepy southern hollow that was rural and all White to a large African American majority and increasingly cosmopolitan. County Executive Curry presided over a period of unprecedented population growth, development, and modernization of Prince George’s County and making it the national standard of African American success in local governance. Under Wayne’s leadership, Prince George’s County became the first county in our history where education and income levels rose as it transitioned from majority White to majority African American. His businessfriendly approach led Prince George’s County through a severe financial crisis, the end of court mandated bussing, the construction of 26 new schools and a new stadium for the Washington Redskins. He saw the county go from a deficit of $108 million to enjoying a $120 million surplus, protecting the county’s AAA bond rating. County Executive Wayne K. Curry passed away on July 2, 2014, at the age of 63 after losing his battle to lung cancer. He is survived by his wife, Sheila Curry; his son, Julian Curry; and daughter, Taylor Curry. Wayne Curry never sought to make history, but simply to serve the community and the people and to better their lives. He was always about the future and getting it right. Wayne K. Curry will live on through his historical impact on the people that I represent, and this bill will honor the vision, contribution, and legacy of the iconic Wayne K. Curry and will be a daily remainder in the heart of the county he cared so deeply about. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time. I urge passage of H.R. 4890, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4890, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 9801 Apollo Drive in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, as the ‘‘Wayne K. Curry Post Office Building.’’ I thank my colleague from Maryland, Congressman ANTHONY  BROWN , for his leadership in introducing this bill, which I am proud to cosponsor. Wayne Curry was an exceptional leader whose vision and commitment led to many of the groundbreaking developments that have helped make Prince George’s County such a vibrant and dynamic county today. He was also a trailblazer committed to opening the doors of opportunity for African Americans in business and government. Mr. Curry was a graduate of Western Maryland College and of the University of Maryland Law School in Baltimore. He worked for many years in commercial real estate and then eventually led the Prince George’s Chamber of Commerce. Early in his career, he served as an aide to former County Executive Winfield M. Kelly. Mr. Curry was elected the County Executive of Prince George’s County in 1994—one of the first African Americans to be elected to lead a county in the nation—and was reelected in 1998. As County Executive, he was a fierce advocate for Prince George’s County and for its residents, and fought to increase funding for public schools, to ensure that economic development in the county benefited all residents, and to ensure that minority contractors had a fair chance to compete for governmentfunded contracts. The Washington Post wrote that Mr. Curry was ‘‘A champion of black affluence’’ who ‘‘believed that economic power was the last milestone of the civil rights struggle.’’ We are blessed to have the memory and example of Wayne Curry to help lead us as we continue to fight to reach that last milestone and achieve the equality of economic opportunity that is essential to making the American dream a reality for minorities across this nation. I urge all Members to support H.R. 4890 and again thank Congressman BROWN for his work on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4890. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
MAJOR ROBERT ODELL OWENS POST OFFICE Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5238) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1234 Saint Johns Place in Brooklyn, New York, as the ‘‘Major Robert Odell Owens Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5238 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1234 Saint Johns Place in Brooklyn, New York, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Major Robert Odell Owens Post Office’’.

(Ms. P LASKETT ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5238, a bill to name the post office at 1234 Saint Johns Place in Brooklyn, New York, after Major Robert Odell Owens. Major Owens led a life of public service, beginning as a librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library. At around the same time, Owens became a member of the Brooklyn chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, where he worked to fight racism and discrimination in New York City. From 1975 to 1982, Owens served as New York State senator. In 1982, Owens won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he went on to serve 24 years as a representative to the citizens of New York City. In Congress, Owens fought passionately for many causes, including education policy. He was active in the Congressional Black Caucus Education Brain Trust, promoting reading, science, and math education. This bill would honor Congressman Owens’ service by naming a post office in Brooklyn in his name. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1530 Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 5238, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1234 Saint Johns Place in Brooklyn, New York, as the Major Robert Odell Owens Post Office. This is particularly important to me, as Congressman Owens was my Congressman as a child growing up, and Saint Johns Place was the street on which my mother lived when she came from the Virgin Islands to live in New York City. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. CLARKE ), and from that great place called Brooklyn, to tell us more about Congressman Owens. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the U.S. Virgin Islands and quasi Brooklynite for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues’ support for H.R. 5238, the Major Robert Odell Owens Post Office designation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a former colleague, a groundbreaking legislator, who is credited and lauded for being a forerunner of the progressive political movement in Brooklyn, New York, my predecessor, the Honorable Major Robert Odell Owens. Congressman Owens served in this body from 1983 to 2007, and he served in both Brooklyn’s 12th and 11th Congressional Districts of New York. Congressman Owens still brings to memory for many the fond recollections of his groundbreaking legislative accomplishments as a senior, longstanding member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Owens spent 8 years in the New York State Senate before he was elected to serve in Brooklyn, New York’s 12th Congressional District, a seat previously held by the Honorable Shirley Chisholm, his predecessor. Mr. Owens then went on to serve his community for over two decades. Through his committee work and work with the Congressional Black Caucus’ Education Brain Trust, Major Owens became known as the Education Congressman, but he was also deemed with another moniker, the Rapping Rep, due to his ability to intertwine his political perspective into rhythmic poetry. Mr. Owens will always be remembered for the legislative victories he achieved on the Hill, and his spectacular fight, particularly for the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, for which he is credited with its passage. His accomplishments in Congress are vast, and many are stemmed from his lifelong passion for education, community development, and equality. Mr. Owens’ passion for education began during his career in librarianship where he served as the community information librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library for a decade. His friends and fellow activists in the Brooklyn community note that Mr. Owens was known to place collections from the Brooklyn Public Library in local stores, restaurants, laundromats, and more because his passion lay within sharing knowledge and resources to those who may not have immediate access to it. Mr. Owens was one of the founders of the New York Social Responsibilities Roundtable which was an organization that is now a part of the New York Library Association. Their mission is to create a central position for libraries and librarians in the battle for civil rights, social justice, peace, and ever improved public access to education and information. Congressman Owens’ dynamic passions for public education, information sharing, equality, and civil rights became driving forces for him to run for Congress as a former head of the Congress of Racial Equality. His legacy in Brooklyn led him to become a continued featured speaker at the White House Conference on Library and Information Services, as well as a recipient of the American Library Association’s highest honor: honorary membership. Fittingly nicknamed the Librarian in Congress, Mr. Owens was dedicated to helping communities of color receive access to information resources through local public libraries. Mr. Owens was a pillar within the United States Congress as an advocate for Americans with disabilities, social justice reform, library funding, education reform, as well as development in public schools and libraries to ensure that underserved communities did not lack access to information and education resources. As a young public servant myself, I was inspired by Mr. Owens’ work with the disabilities activists who often visited his office and eventually provided testimony before Mr. Owens’ House Subcommittee on Select Education where he fought to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA. Today, Brooklynites benefit from public library resource initiatives because of his advocacy for funding. The ADA still stands as a law to prevent discrimination against Americans with disabilities, as it guarantees to create equal opportunity for the special needs community. To this day, my colleagues and I work to protect this law at all costs, thanks to Congressman Owens’ dedication to ensure that this law was enacted. I am so proud to be his successor. H.R. 5238 would designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1234 Saint Johns Place in Brooklyn, New York, the Major Robert Odell Owens Post Office. Congressman Owens will always be remembered in the district that he represented, and I am extremely pleased that the House will consider this bill in honor of his rich legacy and contributions to our great Chamber. As I continue the distinct honor of representing the Ninth Congressional District of New York, I look forward to commemorating the life, memory, and integrity of our former House colleague, Congressman Major Robert Odell Owens, my trailblazing predecessor. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge passage of H.R. 5238, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5238. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
STANLEY MICHELS POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2692) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4558 Broadway in New York, New York, as the ‘‘Stanley Michels Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4558 Broadway in New York, New York, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Stanley Michels Post Office Building’’.

Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2692, a bill to name the post office at 4558 Broadway in New York, New York, after Stanley E. Michels. Stanley Michels was a lawyer and politician from Washington Heights who was a New York councilman from 1978 to 2001. He was active in environmental protection and public health, having sponsored New York City’s first law regulating smoking in public places. Michels also sponsored one of the first city laws to prevent childhood lead poisoning, and he played a significant role in expanding the city’s recycling program. Stanley Michels was a dedicated public servant. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of S. 2692, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4558 Broadway in New York as the Stanley Michels Post Office Building. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ), to tell us more about Stanley E. Michels. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman STACEY  PLASKETT for yielding me time as well as Ranking Member ELIJAH CUMMINGS  and TREY GOWDY for their support in bringing this bill to the floor. I have a special acknowledgement and thank you to Senator KIRSTEN  GILLIBRAND , who introduced the Senate version of my bill which is before us today. I rise in strong support of S. 2692, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4558 Broadway in Manhattan as the Stanley Michels Post Office Building. Stanley Michels was a great public servant. He was a loving family man and he was from my neighborhood of Washington Heights. He served on the New York City Council from 1978 to 2001, representing Council District 6, and always did so with distinction and with integrity. As the chairman of the New York City Council’s Committee on Environmental Protection from 1992 through 2001, Stanley was best known for his activism on environmental issues, particularly water quality, and also he was a strong advocate of tenants’ rights. He was a very strong supporter of New York City parks. They called him the King of the Parks in New York City and he injected millions of dollars into the park system across the City of New York, but, particularly, in northern Manhattan: Fort Tryon Park, Inwood Hill Park, Highbridge Park, Bennett Park, and Isham Park. All of these parks in the long, narrow neck of northern Manhattan received tremendous funding from Stanley Michels. In many ways, Stanley was ahead of his time. In 1987, he was a prime sponsor of the Clean Indoor Air Act, which was New York City’s first law regulating smoking in public places. He was also the visionary behind the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act of 1982, legislation that is still relevant today in New York City and New York State. He played a significant role in expanding the city’s recycling program and in advocating for a memorandum of understanding among the city, the State, and upstate communities to protect the city’s watershed in the Catskill Mountains. After years of public service and a long fight against cancer, Stanley passed away in 2008, but his legacy will not be forgotten. It is my honor to see a post office named in his honor. Stanley Michels and his family poured their hearts into making New York City a better place for all of us to live in. This included: his wife, Molly Michels; his sister, Ellen Grant; his son, Jeffrey; and his two daughters, Karen and Shari Michels—who is now a New York City civil court judge—and three grandchildren. Stanley Michels left a tremendous legacy and he made a difference. Naming this post office after Stanley Michels is a fitting tribute to honor his memory and all of his contributions to New York City. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have sponsored this bill, and I look forward to celebrating Stanley Michels’ legacy next month. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time. I urge passage of S. 2692, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2692. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CORPORAL JEFFERY ALLEN WILLIAMS POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4407) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 3s101 Rockwell Street in Warrenville, Illinois, as the ‘‘Corporal Jeffery Allen Williams Post Office Building.’’ The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SECTION 1. CORPORAL JEFFERY ALLEN WILLIAMS POST OFFICE BUILDING.

Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4407, introduced by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ). H.R. 4407 would name the post office on Rockwell Street in Warrenville, Illinois, in honor of the life and service of Corporal Jeffery Allen Williams. Corporal Williams was born in 1985 and graduated from Wheaton Warrenville South High School in 2003. Shortly after graduating, Williams joined the Army and trained to become a medical specialist, dedicating his career and life to help his fellow soldiers. Williams was deployed to Iraq in 2005, where he was assigned as a medic in thenColonel H.R. McMaster’s personal security detachment. Tragically, Corporal Williams was killed in action in Iraq in September 2005. He is remembered by his troop as a dedicated, tough, and disciplined medic who always put others before himself. His decorations include the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Army Commendation Medal. We thank Corporal Williams for his service and sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to honor him. I look forward to hearing more about Corporal Williams from the sponsor of this bill, Mr. HULTGREN , in a few minutes, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 4407 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service at 3s101 Rockwell Street in Warrenville, Illinois, as the Corporal Jeffery Allen Williams Post Office Building. Corporal Jeffery Allen Williams began his military career in 2003, completing his basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia, and qualifying as a 91W specialist and basic medical technician. He was deployed to Iraq in February 2005 and was tragically killed in action on September 5 of that year while serving as a medic for the regimental commander’s personal security detachment. Corporal Williams’ awards include the Purple Heart, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Bronze Star, as well as the Combat Medic Badge. Corporal Williams was well loved in his community and held a special regard for the post office, having spent many days in his youth becoming friends with the office staff. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to name the post office in Warrenville, Illinois, in memory of Corporal Williams and the ultimate sacrifice he made to his community and this country. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 4407, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ), who is the sponsor of this bill. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, Mr. WALKER , for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and in memory of Corporal Jeffery Allen Williams from my district in Warrenville, Illinois. Jeff will be remembered by his fellow servicemen and women as a dedicated, tough, and disciplined medic who always put others before himself and was committed to his medical mission and fellow soldiers. Upon graduation from Wheaton Warrenville South High School, Jeff began his military training in 2003 at Fort Benning, Georgia. He continued his training at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, graduating as a 91 Whiskey medical specialist and basic emergency medical technician. In January 2004, Jeff was assigned to Fort Carson, Colorado, with Medical Troop, Support Squadron of the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment. Jeff deployed to Iraq in February 2005 with the ambulance platoon and was assigned as a medic for the regimental commander’s personal security detachment. During his tour, Jeff recognized the dire need for qualified medics and decided to reenlist in order to further serve his fellow soldiers and his country. When his service would eventually end, Jeff intended to continue his college education and become a physician’s assistant after his return from Iraq. Tragically, while serving in Tal Afar, Iraq, Jeff was killed in action on September 5, 2005. During his all too brief but distinguished military career, Jeff received various awards and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and the Army Service Ribbon. Jeff was also awarded the Combat Medic Badge. While Jeff is remembered by his Army colleagues as a dedicated and selfless soldier, he was that and much more to his family and friends at home. Those in the Warrenville community described Jeff as ‘‘the gregarious glue that connected our social networks together.’’ Jeff’s sense of humor was magnetic, and his ability to connect with people and care about others was incredible. He befriended pretty much everyone in his class of 700 at Wheaton Warrenville South High School. Jeff had a special affection for new students and was their first friend, making a point to sit with them at lunch and including them in his group of friends. Everyone who knew Jeff loved him, and there were few people in the Warrenville community who did not know Jeff. Jeff and his younger brother were raised by their mother. As the older brother, Jeff took on many of the household responsibilities, which included running errands for his mother. Jeff’s frequent and favorite errand was running to the Warrenville Post Office for his mother. Over time, he came to know employees by name and they him, and he became friends with most of them. Jeff would go out of his way to brighten everyone’s day there. He would often get lost in conversation, causing him to arrive home late. His mother came to realize that if Jeff wasn’t home, he likely was at the post office, making friends and engaging with all who crossed his path. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate, in honor of Jeff’s service to our Nation, that I am introducing this legislation, H.R. 4407, to name the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 3s101 Rockwell Street in Warrenville, Illinois, as the Corporal Jeffery Allen Williams Post Office Building. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of Corporal Jeffery Allen Williams by supporting my legislation to name a post office facility in his hometown after this remarkable young man, so that his service and sacrifice and his impression on his community may be long remembered. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge passage of H.R. 4407, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4407. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
GEORGE SAKATO POST OFFICE Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 931) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4910 Brighton Boulevard in Denver, Colorado, as the ‘‘George Sakato Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 931 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4910 Brighton Boulevard in Denver, Colorado, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘George Sakato Post Office’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘George Sakato Post Office’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 931, introduced by the senior Senator from Colorado, Senator CORY GARDNER . S. 931 would name the post office at 4910 Brighton Boulevard in Denver, Colorado, in honor of Private George T. Sakato. Born in Colton, California, Sakato joined the U.S. Army in 1944. Sakato served in the Army’s 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II. On October 29, 1944, Sakato showed extraordinary heroism, charging a hill on the front line in France, winning control of the site and assuming control of his platoon after his platoon leader was killed in action. In recognition of his heroism, Congress awarded him Nation’s highest award for military valor, the Medal of Honor. After returning home, Sakato continued 27 years of his life to work at the Stockyards Station Post Office. Today and through this bill, we celebrate Private Sakato’s life and service to his Nation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill honoring his life and service, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of S. 931 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4910 Brighton Boulevard in Denver, Colorado, as the George Sakato Post Office. Born in California in 1921, George Sakato overcame discrimination to become an American hero. Classified as an ‘‘enemy alien’’ because of his Japanese heritage, Mr. Sakato was rejected by the Army Air Forces when he tried to enlist shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Mr. Sakato did not quit though, saying decades later, in 2009: ‘‘What do you mean ‘enemy alien’? I am an American.’’ Mr. Sakato continued trying to enlist until he was finally accepted by the Army Ground Forces in 1944 and sent to fight in Europe, and we are glad that he did. There, he exemplified hard work and selflessness, serving with the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a unit of Japanese Americans that would become the most highly decorated combat unit of its size and time serving in U.S. history. Private Sakato would contribute to that legacy, earning the Army’s second highest combat honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, after courageously leading his fellow soldiers to overtake the enemy in France after his platoon leader was killed. In the year 2000, Private Sakato was awarded, as we heard, the Medal of Honor along with 21 other Asian American World War II veterans. Private Sakato worked for the United States post office in Denver for more than two decades and passed away at the age of 94 in 2015. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of S. 931 to commemorate Private Sakato’s service and to honor the contributions he and so many other Japanese Americans have made to this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 931. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
JACK H. BROWN POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2979) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 390 West 5th Street in San Bernardino, California, as the ‘‘Jack H. Brown Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2979 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 390 West 5th Street in San Bernardino, California, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Jack H. Brown Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Jack H. Brown Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from the Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2979, a bill to name the post office at 390 West 5th Street in San Bernardino in honor of Jack H. Brown. Jack Brown was born in San Bernardino, California, in 1938. He served in the Navy’s Pacific Fleet during the Vietnam era. After returning home, Brown took a job at Stater Bros. Markets, a popular local grocery store. He would go on to found Stater Brothers Charities, along with the Boys and Girls Club in San Bernardino and Children’s Fund of San Bernardino County. Jack did a great deal for his community, and it is fitting that we would name now a post office in his hometown in his honor. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 2979, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 390 West 5th Street in San Bernardino, California, as the Jack H. Brown Post Office Building. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR ) so that he may tell us more about the honorable veteran from San Bernardino, California, Jack Brown. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. Many communities have largerthan life figures, people who dedicate themselves to the service of others and change countless lives for the better, leaders who touch so many lives that their legacies outlive them. For my community in southern California’s Inland Empire, that figure was Jack H. Brown. Jack was the executive chairman of Stater Bros. Markets, one of the Inland Empire’s largest employers. But he will be remembered for far more than his successes as a local community member than as a business leader. Jack poured himself into our community using his time and resources to make the Inland Empire a better place, especially for children. He helped establish the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino to give the children of our community a safe place to learn, live, and grow. He served as the founding chairman for the Children’s Fund of San Bernardino County, a nonprofit organization that has provided assistance to more than 1.4 million children in our region since its inception in 1986. 
But Jack’s commitment to his community didn’t stop there. Each time our region has been rocked by earthquakes, wildfires, floods, or acts of terror, like on December 2, 2015, we knew that Jack Brown would be there for the community and for the brave first responders who ensured that loss of life didn’t continue to grow. b1600 When we lost Jack Brown in late 2016, we lost a constant presence in our community. That is why I offered this bill to designate the U.S. Post Office at 390 West 5th Street in San Bernardino as the Jack H. Brown Post Office Building. While I can never truly repay Jack for all that he did for our community, I am hopeful that honoring his name in this way will restore that constant presence and remind the Inland Empire of the contributions of this truly great man. Jack and I had a great relationship. Although he liked to tell me that I was his mayor in Redlands, Jack was sure to remind everyone that San Bernardino was his hometown. I am proud that this bill will memorialize his name at the center of the hometown that he loved so much. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time. I urge the passage of H.R. 2979, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BACON ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2979. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SPECIALIST TREVOR A. WIN’E POST OFFICE Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4946) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1075 North Tustin Street in Orange, California, as the ‘‘Specialist Trevor A. Win’E Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4946 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1075 North Tustin Street in Orange, California, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Specialist Trevor A.

(b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Specialist Trevor A. Win’E Post Office’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may conclude. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4946, a bill to name the post office at 1075 North Tustin Street in Orange, California, in honor of U.S. Army Specialist Trevor Win’E. Trevor Win’E was born in 1981, in Orange, California. Specialist Win’E enlisted in the Army shortly after the 9/ 11 terrorist attacks to train as a petroleum supply specialist. In 2003, he was set to deploy to South Korea but requested to, instead, deploy with his unit to Iraq, a request the Army granted. One year later, he was killed when his convoy encountered an IED attack in Tikrit, Iraq, causing fatal injuries. Today, we honor Specialist Trevor Win’E’s bravery and sacrifice for our Nation with a small but lasting symbol of our gratefulness and respect. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 4946, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1075 North Tustin Street in Orange, California, as the Specialist Trevor A. Win’E Post Office. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ) to tell us more about Trevor Anthony Win’E. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today in support of H.R. 4946. Freedom is not free. All gave some, and many made the ultimate sacrifice for our country and for our freedom. Army Specialist Trevor Anthony Win’E, one of my constituents, made the ultimate sacrifice. I am privileged today to introduce this bill to name the United States Post Office at 1075 North Tustin Street in Orange, California, after Army Specialist Trevor Anthony Win’E. Trevor was born on September 24, 1981, the youngest of three children, to Rick and Deborah Win’E. He attended Calvary Chapel High School in Santa Ana, my hometown, graduating in the year 2000. His family and close friends recall Trevor as a compassionate and devout young man, always willing to help, always willing to lend a hand. Trevor was indeed a man of strong convictions who wanted to serve our country. Just months after the 9/11 attacks on our country, Trevor enlisted in the U.S. Army on May 1, 2002. After basic training, he was trained as a petroleum supply specialist. He was assigned to the Army’s 24th Quartermaster Supply Company at Fort Lewis, Washington, where he had a key role in multiple training operations. According to Lieutenant Colonel John Pratt, commander of the 24th Quartermaster Supply Company, Trevor was dedicated to his fellow soldiers. In November 2003, Trevor’s company was scheduled to deploy to Iraq, but Trevor was assigned to move to South Korea instead. He, of course, requested he deploy and serve alongside his fellow servicemembers in Iraq. Trevor was granted his request and continued to serve with his company, with his coworkers in Iraq. In Tikrit, Iraq, Trevor was in the lead truck of a convoy, serving as a turret gunner. Unfortunately, the convoy was attacked by multiple improvised explosive devices and Trevor suffered severe injuries. The following day, on May 1, 2004, 2 years to the date of his enlistment, Trevor died. He was 22 years young. Trevor was proud of his military service and wanted to serve in a capacity critical to the operations of a fighting force. He answered the call of duty after our Nation was attacked. Naming the post office after Trevor is a fitting tribute to his service and sacrifice to our great country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4946. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, actually, I have no further speakers. I want to thank the gentleman for his powerful words about a life well and honorably lived. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 4946, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4946. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
SERGEANT DIETRICH SCHMIEMAN POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5504) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4801 West Van Giesen Street in West Richland, Washington, as the ‘‘Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5504 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4801 West Van Giesen Street in West Richland, Washington, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5504, a bill introduced by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ) to name a post office in West Richland, Washington, in honor of Marine Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman. Marine Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman grew up in Richland, Washington. After graduating high school in 2009, Schmieman enlisted in the Marine Corps, eventually attending the Special Operations School. Sergeant Schmieman completed two overseas deployments. He received multiple honors during his service, including two Marine Corps Achievement Medals and a Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation. He also achieved his goal of serving as a critical skills operator in the 2nd Raider Battalion. In July 2017, Sergeant Schmieman was tragically killed in a cargo plane crash over Mississippi. We thank him for his service to our Nation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill in his honor. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to hearing more about this bill from Congressman NEWHOUSE in a few minutes, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 5504, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4801 West Van Giesen Street in West Richland, Washington, as the Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office Building. A graduate of Columbia Basin College, Dietrich Schmieman joined the Marine Corps in 2009. Following a deployment to Okinawa, Japan, as a military parachutist and diver, Dietrich was promoted to sergeant and selected for Marine Corps Special Operations School. You heard that he tragically lost his life in a cargo plane crash in July, but before that, he would complete a second overseas deployment and attain his goal of serving as a critical skills operator. Sergeant Schmieman received 14 awards and decorations during his service and continues to be deeply missed by his Marine team, who plans to climb his beloved Mount Rainier in his honor this summer. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 5504, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from North Carolina for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of legislation that will commemorate the life and service of a young man from central Washington who died serving his country just over a year ago, on July 10, 2017. Marine Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman grew up in Richland, Washington, with his parents, Eric and Susan, and his two brothers, Aaron and Hans. He attended Christ the King Catholic School, Hanford High School, and Columbia Basin College, where he met friends who would remain close to him throughout his entire life. In 2010, with a world of opportunity ahead of him, he chose to dedicate his life to service and enlist in the United States Marine Corps. It was his goal to serve within Special Operations Command. Throughout his service, he received 14 awards and decorations, including several Achievement Medals, Good Conduct Medals, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He had completed two overseas deployments, serving our Nation during Operation Enduring Freedom. He achieved his goal, honorably serving as a critical skills operator in the U.S. Marine Corps 2nd Raider Battalion at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, when he was tragically killed in a KC–130 plane crash in Mississippi on July 10, 2017. My legislation would designate the U.S. Postal Service facility at 4801 West Van Giesen Street in West Richland, Washington, as the Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office Building. Dietrich and his fellow servicemembers gave the ultimate sacrifice, and I hope to honor his memory, as well as the memory of the 15 other men and women killed in the crash, with this dedication to their service. Dietrich’s strong ties to his family, friends, and hometown continue to be evident. An avid skydiver, Dietrich’s death inspired his parents, childhood friends, and fellow marines to complete a memorial skydive over central Washington. He had a tattoo symbolizing his love of the Pacific Northwest and requested that his ashes be spread on Mount Rainier, where his Marine brothersinarms will hike this August in his honor. We recently observed the 1year anniversary of the devastating plane crash, and I know that the designation of this post office will mean a lot to Dietrich’s family and to our community, serving as a local memorial and a reminder of the sacrifice he and his fellow servicemembers gave to preserve the freedoms that are the cornerstone of our Nation. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to name this building, which will be visited often by friends and family, after a courageous young man whose life and service deserve this honor. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge the passage of H.R. 5504 in memory of Sergeant Schmieman, an American hero, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5504. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1615 CREATING ADVANCED STREAMLINED ELECTRONIC SERVICES FOR CONSTITUENTS ACT OF 2018 Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3076) to amend section 552a of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Privacy Act) to require agencies to accept electronic release forms, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3076 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents Act of 2018’’ or the ‘‘CASES Act’’. 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) congressional offices provide crucial services to constituents by acting as a liaison between the constituents and the respective agencies; (2) this includes assisting constituents by making inquiries and working toward resolutions on behalf of the constituent with the respective agencies; and (3) this process should be simplified through the creation of electronic forms that may be submitted under section 552a of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Privacy Act), thus modernizing the process for constituents and improving access and efficiency of Government services and agencies in order to expedite the resolution of the problem for which constituents sought help. 
(a) G UIDANCE .—Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director shall issue guidance that does the following: (1) Establishes— (A) standards for each agency to develop an electronic identity proofing and authentication process for allowing an individual to provide a prior written electronic consent form for the disclosure of the individual’s record under section 552a(b) of title 5, United States Code, or for individual access to a record under section 552a(d) of such title; or (B) a method by which each agency can electronically identity proof and authenticate an individual submitting an electronic consent form through a central online portal. (2) Creates a template for an electronic consent form that can be properly identity proofed and authenticated in accordance with paragraph (1). (3) Requires each agency to accept the electronic consent form described in paragraph (2) that provides consent from any individual properly identity proofed and authenticated in accordance with paragraph (1) from the individual providing consent or an entity other than the individual, including a congressional office, on behalf of the individual for the purpose of authorizing the disclosure of the individual’s record in accordance with section 552a(b) or 552a(d) of title 5, United States Code. (4) Authorizes each agency to provide an online link to the consolidated online portal described under subsection (b)(1). (b) PORTAL ; CONSENT IDENTIFIER ; CONGRES SIONAL FUNCTION .— (1) CONSOLIDATED ONLINE PORTAL .— (A) OPERATION OF PORTAL .—The Director (or a designee) shall operate (or designate the head of an agency to operate) a consolidated online portal that allows a member of the public to submit an electronic consent form in accordance with the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (a) to any agency from a single website. (B) PRIVACY AND OTHER FEATURES .—The portal shall include features to protect the privacy of individuals using the portal and may include any additional functions the Director finds will improve the implementation of this section. (C) USE OF EXISTING WEBSITE OR PORTAL .— The Director may use any existing website or portal to satisfy the requirements of this subsection, including the portal established under section 552(m) of title 5, United States Code. (2) CONSENT IDENTIFIER .—The Director, or a designee, shall assign each consent form submitted through the portal described in paragraph (1) a consent identifier, which shall be provided to the agency and the individual or entity submitting the consent form. The agency shall track the consent form with the consent identifier. (3) CONGRESSIONAL ASSISTANCE FUNCTION .— (A) IN GENERAL .—The Director, or a designee, shall ensure the operation of a function that allows a congressional office to provide a publicly available online link to the portal described in paragraph (1), which shall autopopulate information about such congressional office, including an indication of consent for such office to access a record in accordance with section 552a(b) of title 5, United States Code, in the consent form accessed through the portal. (B) NOTIFICATION OF CONSENT IDENTIFIER  
REQUIRED .— The Director, or a designee, shall ensure the function sends the consent identifier to the congressional office when a consent form is submitted to an agency through the portal as accessed through the function. (c) AGENCY COMPLIANCE .—Each agency shall comply with the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (a) not later than 1 year after the date on which such guidance is issued. (d) DEFINITIONS .—In this section: (1) AGENCY ; INDIVIDUAL ; RECORD .—The terms ‘‘agency’’, ‘‘individual’’, and ‘‘record’’ have the meanings given those terms in section 552a(a) of title 5, United States Code. (2) CONSENT IDENTIFIER .—The term ‘‘consent identifier’’ means a nonproprietary, unique identification number. (3) DIRECTOR .—The term ‘‘Director’’ means the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
No additional funds are authorized to carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3076, the CASES for Constituents Act, introduced by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ). One of the most important services we can provide our constituents is help in navigating the complicated bureaucracy of Federal agencies. Whether it is a senior who needs help with a Social Security office or a veteran whose benefits are delayed, as Members of Congress, we can often help constituents reach a real person and get better results from Federal agencies. However, in order for us to assist constituents while protecting their privacy rights, the Privacy Act requires constituents to complete and sign a consent form before agencies can provide a Member of Congress information about the case. The constituent prints the form or obtains it in person from a congressional office, signs it, and then mails, faxes, emails, or physically brings it back to the congressional office. The congressional office then must send the consent form to the agency from which the constituent needs help. This process has unnecessary steps, leading to delays that frustrate our constituents, many of whom need help quickly. H.R. 3076 helps to speed up the process by allowing constituents to submit Privacy Act consent forms electronically directly to the agency or a central portal. H.R. 3076 instructs the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance to Federal agencies to accept electronic consent. OMB’s guidance will maintain a role for congressional caseworkers to advocate on behalf of constituents for a swift resolution. A swift resolution is especially important for those constituents in the wake of natural disasters, since victims often need to reach out to multiple Federal entities for relief. At a time when many citizens need help from their government, allowing them to communicate more easily with the government is the very least we can do. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representatives GARRET GRAVES and JOEKENNEDY for introducing this bill to improve constituents’ experiences when they are seeking help. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this practical solution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, the CASES for Constituents Act, introduced by Representatives GARRET  GRAVES and J OEKENNEDY . This bill, as you heard, would modernize the way Federal agencies process Privacy Act waivers and make it easier for Members of Congress to help constituents get assistance from Federal agents. We all know what this means. It helps to speed up the process of assisting your constituents, so it is a very valuable improvement. A constituent has to provide an agency with written consent before a congressional office can obtain information from the agency on behalf of the constituent. Some agencies, as we have heard and know, have outdated policies and still require these consent forms to be mailed or faxed. Under the bill before us, the Office of Management and Budget would be required to establish standards for Federal agencies to accept electronic consent forms and for agencies to accept such forms. The bill also would require the OMB to operate a consolidated online portal that would allow individuals to submit electronic consent forms and to track 
the status of their form. The bill would also allow congressional offices to provide online links to the portal. I appreciate very much the bipartisan way in which this bill was developed. I want to thank the majority for their cooperation in making a number of improvements to the bill; for example, the substitute amendment would require OMB to include features to protect the privacy of individuals who use the consolidated online portal required under the bill. Mr. Speaker, this is a good, bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina for working with us on this, as well as many staff and members from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Mr. Speaker, can you imagine for a minute if you had a medical emergency at your house and you had to mail a form to the ambulance service to have them come address the heart attack victim or other type of medical emergency that is occurring at your house? How irrational is that? Obviously, it doesn’t make sense to do something like that, to mail for something that may be an emergency. Mr. Speaker, can you imagine, even in today’s time, with the strict demands we have for customer service, if we actually had to truly mail order forms to different online companies to have them deliver something, to retail outlets to have them deliver something, a product to our house? There would be no tolerance for that. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the government right now, the government today, our own United States Government which is here to serve our own Americans, only has a customer service rating of about 70 percent. In fact, it is less than 70 percent. Well, that might have been a high watermark for my grades in school— maybe—Mr. Speaker, but that is absolutely an unacceptable level. This is our government. These are our taxpayers. Why is it that private industry has been able to use technology to provide better customer service, to provide faster services? It is because they care about their customers and they care about their business and there is an incentive for them to do so. They don’t have a monopoly, like the Federal Government does, for many of the services that it offers, but that does not excuse the Federal Government from providing better services. Mr. Speaker, I had an opportunity to work very closely with Congressman JOEKENNEDY to help develop this legislation, and this is a solution to help bring the United States Government into the 21st century, or perhaps the 20th century. It simply does the same thing that private companies have figured out how to do for decades now, where we can access our banks online, we can access our insurance online, where we can go online to buy groceries and virtually any other good or service that we need. We can even file our own taxes with the Federal Government. Yet the Privacy Act of 1974, as it is implemented today, requires, in order for us to provide services to our constituents, which may be an emergency situation, that they have to print out a form and mail it in, and that we then have to take and mail it to an agency. That is ridiculous in 2018, and it is unacceptable. This bipartisan legislation addresses that. It allows for people to access their own government, access government services to address important things like, perhaps, accessing their VA benefits; like, perhaps, fixing a wrong the IRS has caused; like, perhaps, dislodging a permit or some other type of service the government is supposed to provide and has been sitting on, in some cases as we have dealt with, for years. Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you a quick story. In 2016, in August of that year, in my hometown of Baton Rouge in south Louisiana, we experienced a 1,000year flood. People were calling us by the hundreds per day, calling and saying: I need help. I need help with FEMA, SBA, and other government services. We said: Yes, you bet. All you need to do is go to our website, print out this form, and then mail it to us. Mr. Speaker, I can’t say on the House floor some of the responses our office received whenever they were telling us about the 4 feet of water that their computers and printers and other equipment were under. It was a real aha moment. How ridiculous is it that we sit here and act like we are 80 years ago as a government? We can do better. This simply brings us to current technology, to allow constituents to reach out to our offices when we are addressing urgent issues, like passport issues for folks stuck in other countries, like Department of Defense issues where our own military men and women may be having problems in other countries, where our own citizens aren’t getting the benefits that they paid for or they earned. It gives us the ability to quickly step in and address their issues, to intervene on their behalf and get these issues resolved. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, especially, my friend JOEKENNEDY for working with us so closely on this bipartisan legislation, Congresswoman MIMI WALTERS , Congressman G ENE GREEN , Congressmen W ILLHURD and KEVIN MCCARTHY through the Innovation Initiative, Congressman MARK MEADOWS , Delegate E LEANOR HOLMES  NORTON , Congresswoman B ARBARA  COMSTOCK , and many others who provided input to us, helped us perfect this legislation and get it here today. I want to thank the bipartisan cosponsors and folks who helped us on this. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, obviously this bill would work a very substantial improvement on our constituent services operations. I have no further speakers. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 3076, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3076, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to require the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance on electronic consent forms, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SPC. STERLING WILLIAM WYATT POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4960) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 511 East Walnut Street in Columbia, Missouri, as the ‘‘Spc. Sterling William Wyatt Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4960 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SPC. STERLING WILLIAM WYATT POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 511 East Walnut Street in Columbia, Missouri, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Spc. Sterling William Wyatt Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Spc. Sterling William Wyatt Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4960, a bill introduced by the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ) to name the post office at 511 East Walnut Street in Columbia, Missouri, in honor of Specialist Sterling William Wyatt. Sterling Wyatt was born and raised in Columbia, Missouri. Even before he graduated high school, Wyatt had shown great service and achievement. He participated in the youth group and operated the sound equipment for his church. He made the rank of Eagle Scout. He earned a black belt in tae kwon do, and he received a certification as a nurse attendant. After graduating high school in 2009, Wyatt continued his service, enlisting in the United States Army, where he was assigned to the 5th Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division, and was ultimately deployed to Afghanistan. On July 11, 2012, when on patrol in Kandahar, Afghanistan, Wyatt’s vehicle was attacked by an IED, and he was killed in action at age 21. Specialist Wyatt made the ultimate sacrifice in his service of his nation. In recognition of his heroism, Specialist Wyatt was awarded the Medal of Valor, the Bronze Star, and the National Defense Service Medal, among others. We commend him for his service and honor him for his sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman HARTZLER for introducing the bill and look forward to hearing more about the bill from her in the next few minutes. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 4960, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 511 East Walnut Street in Columbia, Missouri, as the Spc. Sterling William Wyatt Post Office Building. Specialist Wyatt epitomized dedication and hard work, becoming an Eagle Scout, first degree black belt in tae kwon do, and a certified nurse attendant before his high school graduation. He carried that spirit with him when he enlisted in the Army, joining the 20th Infantry Regiment. Specialist Wyatt deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan, and gave his life on July 11, 2012, when his vehicle was hit by an IED. Just 21 years old, Specialist Wyatt was awarded the Medal of Valor and a Bronze Star. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to remember the ultimate sacrifice paid by Specialist Sterling William Wyatt. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 4960, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ), the sponsor of this bill. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask support for H.R. 4960, which would name the downtown Columbia, Missouri, post office in memory of one of our Nation’s heroes, Specialist Sterling William Wyatt, who proudly served in the United States Army. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member and so many of my colleagues for your support of this legislation. Sterling was born and raised in Columbia, Missouri, located in the heart of Missouri’s Fourth Congressional District. Early on, Sterling showed his commitment to service by being an active participant in his youth group and in his church. Through his service and hard work, he was quite an accomplished young man. He earned the rank of Eagle Scout, a first degree black belt in tae kwon do, and a certification as a certified nurse attendant, all before graduating from high school in 2009. b1630 Soon after, he decided to continue his lifestyle of service by joining the United States Army. He was assigned to the 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division at Joint Base LewisMcChord in Washington. Tragically, Specialist Wyatt was killed on July 11, 2012, while on patrol in Kandahar, Afghanistan. He was only 21 years old. His vehicle was attacked with an enemy improvised explosive device. His awards and decorations for his service are many, including, but not limited to, the Medal of Valor and Bronze Star. Specialist Wyatt’s dedication to serving his community and country were a testament to his faith and his family, especially his loving parents, Randy and Sherry Wyatt. It is fitting that we bring this bill today for a vote before the United States House of Representatives, because just a few days ago we solemnly remembered the 6year anniversary of his passing. As representatives of the people who bravely serve our country, especially those who pay the ultimate sacrifice, we owe it to their lives and memories to never forget all that they have done for us. Although Sterling was taken from us too soon, this bill will enshrine his memory in our community for posterity so everyone can know this brave soldier and be reminded that freedom is not free. And maybe, when others learn about Sterling’s story and sacrifice, they, too, will put service above self and answer the call to serve, which is the noblest and most honorable action anyone can take. Truly, greater love has no one than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. Sterling did this for his brothers and sisters in arms, for those who yearn to be free in a desperate land, and for all of us. We will forever be grateful. And, with the renaming of this post office in Columbia, Missouri, the Specialist Sterling William Wyatt Post Office Building, we will always remember and always be grateful. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation to honor Specialist Wyatt’s memory. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge the passage of H.R. 4960 in honor of Specialist Wyatt, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4960. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
HARMON KILLEBREW POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3230) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 915 Center Avenue in Payette, Idaho, as the ‘‘Harmon Killebrew Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3230 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 915 Center Avenue in Payette, Idaho, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Harmon Killebrew Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Harmon Killebrew Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3230, a bill introduced by the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. LABRADOR ), to name the post office at 915 Center Avenue in Payette, Idaho, in honor of Harmon Killebrew. Harmon Clayton Killebrew was born in Payette, Idaho, in 1936. He began his career playing major league baseball in 1954. He played over 22 seasons with multiple teams, and when he retired in 1975, he had the fifth most home runs in major league history. Killebrew was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984. In 1976, Killebrew cofounded the Danny Thompson Memorial, an annual golf tournament that raises money for cancer research. Sadly, on March 17, 2011, at the age of 74, Killebrew passed away. He left an incredible legacy, one we continue to honor with this bill. I thank the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. LABRADOR ) for introducing this bill and look forward to hearing more from him about Killebrew in a few minutes. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 3230, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 915 Center Avenue in Payette, Idaho, as the Harmon Killebrew Post Office Building. A member of the Washington Senators, Minnesota Twins, and Kansas City Royals, Harmon Killebrew excelled in major league baseball for 22 years. During that time, he notched an impressive 2,086 hits, played in 13 All Star games, and tallied nine seasons with over 100 RBIs. In fact, I can remember as a kid rooting for the Orioles that we didn’t want Harmon Killebrew coming up to the plate. Harmon retired in 1975 in fifth place for career home runs. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor Harmon Killebrew’s accomplishments to the great American pastime. I urge the passage of H.R. 3230, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. LABRADOR ), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. LABRADOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3230, a bill that honors Idaho’s greatest athlete and one of our great humanitarians. H.R. 3230 names the post office in Payette, Idaho, after Harmon Killebrew, a Hall of Fame baseball player who later built an incredible legacy of charitable work. Idahoans take great pride in Harmon Killebrew’s success, and rightfully so. Killebrew’s career began in 1954 when Herman Welker, the U.S. Senator from Idaho, tipped off the owner of the Washington Senators, Clark Griffith, about the 17yearold slugger. Griffith sent a scout, who almost didn’t get to see Killebrew play. After a night of rain, groundkeepers burned gasoline to make the field playable. Killebrew did his part by hitting a ball 435 feet into a Payette beet field. Immediately signed as a $12,000 bonus baby, Killebrew debuted a few weeks later. During his 22year career with the Washington Senators, Minnesota Twins, and Kansas City Royals, he hit 573 home runs, more than all but four major league players at the time of his retirement. He was the American league’s most valuable player in 1969, hitting 49 home runs and driving in 140 runs. He played in 13 AllStar games and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1984. Killebrew built his strength lifting 10gallon milk cans on Idaho dairies and leveraged his work ethic into legendary status. For fans across America, Killebrew was beloved for remaining the downtoEarth farm kid who signed a major league contract before turning 18. Twins teammate, Rich Reese, called him ‘‘one of the classiest people I’ve ever met in my life. . . . he treated people with respect, even with the stature that he had.’’ Asked what he liked to do for fun, Killebrew once said, ‘‘Well, I like to wash dishes, I guess.’’ In the off season, he worked feeding cows, selling men’s clothing, and reading gas meters. After retirement from baseball, he sold insurance, ran a car dealership, and worked as a broadcaster. In 1976, Killebrew helped found the Danny Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament in Sun Valley, Idaho, now called the KillebrewThompson Memorial. The event benefits cancer research. The Harmon Killebrew Foundation, founded in 1998, with his wife, Nita, has built more than a dozen Miracle League fields designed for kids with disabilities, including one named for him in Payette. The baseball and football fields at Payette High School are also named for Killebrew. Killebrew died of cancer in 2011 at age 74 after entering into hospice care, a treatment he had advocated for for years. At his memorial service, his wife read a tribute from a fan: ‘‘Harmon is an extraordinary, beautiful, loving, compassionate human being, who also happens to be a legendary baseball player.’’ In the days after his death, his high school team, the Payette Pirates, made an improbable run for a State championship. Entering the district tournament with a losing record, the Pirates won four straight to reach the State title game. The team wore HK patches on their sleeves. ‘‘Harmon’s been with us the entire time,’’ said one player. The Pirates finally lost to a 25– 1 Fruitland team, taking home the secondplace trophy. ‘‘He is still touching people,’’ said Nita Killebrew, who worked with my office on the bill and lives in Meridian. Killebrew’s legacy of generosity lives on, and it is appropriate to honor his legacy with the legislation we are considering today. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3230. Through this bill, we will recognize one of Idaho’s greatest stars, and we will advance the legacy of one of America’s most charitable athletes. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge the passage of H.R. 3230 to name the post office in Payette, Idaho, for Harmon Killebrew, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3230. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
VETERANS PROVIDING HEALTHCARE TRANSITION IMPROVEMENT ACT Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 899) to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that the requirements that new Federal employees who are veterans with serviceconnected disabilities are provided leave for purposes of undergoing medical treatment for such disabilities apply to certain employees of the Veterans Health Administration, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 899 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Providing Healthcare Transition Improvement Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DISABLED VETERAN LEAVE FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Section 6329(d)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: ‘‘(1) the term ‘employee’ has the meaning given such term in section 2105, and includes— ‘‘(A) an officer or employee of the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission; and ‘‘(B) notwithstanding subsection (a) of section 7421 of title 38, an individual occupying a position listed in subsection (b) of such section;’’. 
(b) A PPLICABILITY .—With respect to a position listed in section 7421(b) of title 38, United States Code, the amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply to any individual appointed to such a position on or after the date of enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 899, the Veterans Providing Healthcare Transition Improvement Act introduced by the junior Senator from Hawaii. S. 899 is the Senate version of H.R. 2648 introduced by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STIVERS ). In 2015, Congress enacted the Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act. The Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act provides 104 hours of paid sick leave to newly employed veterans with a serviceconnected disability rating of 30 percent or more. The sick leave is used to attend medical treatment related to the service connected disability and must be used within 12 months of beginning employment. The law, however, did not explicitly apply to veterans hired into certain medical occupations at the Department of Veterans Affairs. When the VA has applied the provisions of the act to these occupations, this bill would ensure new veterans hired in these positions continue to receive paid sick leave to treat their serviceconnected disability. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STIVERS ) for sponsoring the House version of this bill and for his dedication to caring for our Nation’s veterans. I would also like to thank Chairman DAVID ROE and his staff at the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs for working with us to bring this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON VETERANS AFFAIRS , Washington, DC, June 19, 2018. Hon. TREYGOWDY , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : I am writing to you concerning H.R. 2648, the ‘‘Veterans Transition Improvement Act,’’ and its Senate companion, S. 899. There are provisions in the legislation that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed expeditiously to floor consideration of this legislation, I am willing to waive this committee’s right to sequential referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving consideration of the bills, the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bills which fall within its jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to name members of this committee to any conference committee which is named to consider such provisions. Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R. 2648 and into the Congressional Record during consideration of this legislation on the House floor. Sincerely, DAVID P. R OE, M.D., Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, June 20, 2018. Hon. DAVID P. R OE, M.D., Chairman, Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : On May 23, 2018, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported H.R. 2648, the Veterans Transition Improvement Act with an amendment, by voice vote. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs with an additional referral to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Based on our previous consultation, we intend to request S. 899—the Senate companion to H.R. 2648—be scheduled for floor consideration. To expedite floor consideration, I ask that you forego further consideration of H.R. 2648. This in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on H.R. 2648, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of S. 899, to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request. Sincerely, TREYGOWDY . 
Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Representatives STIVERS and T AKANO for their sponsorship of this much needed bipartisan bill, which would expand, as you heard, coverage of Representative STEPHEN  LYNCH ’s Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act to newly hired healthcare veterans at the Veterans Health Administration. Approximately onethird of VA’s new hires are veterans. It is no surprise that veterans who leave military service want to continue to serve this country and the American people. We are grateful that these brave men and women, many of whom are wounded themselves, choose to devote their civilian careers to taking care of their fellow wounded warriors. The bill would provide newly hired doctors, nurses, physician assistants, dentists, optometrists, and chiropractors at the VHA who have serviceconnected disabilities with 104 hours of sick leave during their first year of employment to take care of their medical conditions. This is a very good bill that I urge my colleagues to support, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STIVERS ), the champion of this bill and the sponsor of its House companion. Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 899, the Veterans Providing Healthcare Transition Improvement Act. I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), for helping me, being the lead Democrat on this. This is bipartisan and bicameral legislation. Senator HIRONO is the sponsor in the Senate. We are the sponsors in the House. But, Mr. Speaker, it is great to have a veteran in the chair today. Mr. Speaker, as a brigadier general in the Ohio Army National Guard, I know firsthand the incredible sacrifices that our veterans have made in the service of our country. We owe it to them to provide them time when they come home to deal with the things they need to work on, their medical and other conditions. In 2015, the Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act was signed into law, which was great. It gave sick leave to people that are newly hired Federal employees, rather than waiting on that leave to accrue, if they had a disability rating, a serviceconnected disability rating of 30 percent of more. Unfortunately, that bill did not extend those benefits to title 38 employees. b1645 Those are VA employees, like physicians, physician assistants, registered nurses, chiropractors, podiatrists, optometrists, and dentists. They are healthcare providers themselves. It is no small number of employees. In fact, as we sit here, there are over 14,000 vacancies in title 38 jobs. That means up to 14,000 people can benefit from this bill. Again, it is bipartisan. It is a simple change that allows these title 38 veteran employees to get leave to deal with their wounded warrior conditions rather than waiting for that leave to accrue over time. It is a bipartisan bill. I thank Mr. TAKANO for that. A lot of veteran organizations have supported it: the National Association of VA Physicians and Dentists, the Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs, the American Legion, the VFW, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans, Association of the United States Navy, American Federation of Government Employees, National Federation of Federal Employees, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, AMVETS, and the Federal Managers Association. 
I thank the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the gentleman from North Carolina, the gentleman from Maryland, and the chairman from South Carolina for their hard work on this. I also want to thank the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) for their expertise as they worked through this bill. I thank the sponsors of the Senate legislation, and I thank Representative TAKANO for joining me in this important effort. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan legislation. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), one of the sponsors of this very, very important bill. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 899, the Veterans Providing Healthcare Transition Improvement Act, which extends paid sick leave benefits for veteran employees with serviceconnected disabilities in their first year of work at the Department of Veterans Affairs. As the lead Democrat on this bill, I thank my colleague Representative STEVE STIVERS from Ohio for his bipartisan leadership on this issue. And let me hasten to add, I do enjoy the work that we do together as founders and co chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Maker Caucus, bringing to the attention of the Congress advanced manufacturing technologies. But back to the issue at hand. Mr. Speaker, I also thank Senator MAZIE HIRONO for taking the lead on this important issue in the Senate. Veterans who choose to provide their medical skills and expertise to serve other veterans at the Department of Veterans Affairs should not have to take a leave of absence to receive the care that they need. By improving the Wounded Warrior Federal Leave Act to extend benefits to wounded warriors working at the VA, we will help veterans who need to take time off to get their own medical care. This will also help in hiring and recruiting what are known as title 38 employees at the VA. This group of employees includes physicians, physician assistants, registered nurses, chiropractors, podiatrists, optometrists, and dentists. According to 2018 data from the Veterans Health Administration, there are over 14,000 title 38 vacancies nationwide. We must make it a priority to fill these vacancies to ensure that the VA is well staffed and capable of providing veterans with the services that they need. Extending benefits to title 38 employees at the VA can help with the recruitment and hiring of veterans who want to continue helping other veterans. Veterans working at the VA already make incredible sacrifices to help their fellow veterans. Their paychecks should not be one of them. This is why I urge my colleagues to stand with our veterans and support this legislation. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of S. 899, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 899, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘An Act to amend title 5, United States Code, to ensure that the requirements that new Federal employees who are veterans with serviceconnected disabilities are provided leave for purposes of undergoing medical treatment for such disabilities apply to certain employees of the Veterans Health Administration.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ROUTE 66 CENTENNIAL COMMISSION ACT Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 66) to establish the Route 66 Centennial Commission, to direct the Secretary of Transportation to prepare a plan on the preservation needs of Route 66, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 66 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Route 66 Centennial Commission Act’’. 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) Route 66 was the Nation’s first allpaved highway under the U.S. Highway System connecting the Midwest to California and has played a major role in the history of the United States. (2) Route 66 was the symbol of opportunity to hundreds of thousands of people seeking escape from the Dust Bowl in the 1930s, serving as a ‘‘road to opportunity’’ in the West and providing employment during the Great Depression, as thousands were put to work on road crews to pave the road. (3) Route 66 was invaluable in transporting troops, equipment, and supplies across the country to the West, where the government established multiple industries and armed force bases during World War II. Upon the conclusion of the war in 1945, Route 66 was a key route taken by thousands of troops as they returned home. (4) Route 66 symbolized the Nation’s positive outlook during the postwar economic recovery in the 1950s and 1960s, serving as an icon of freespirited independence and linking people across the United States. During this period, the tourist industry along Route 66 grew tremendously, giving rise to countless tourist courts, motels, service stations, garages, and diners. (5) Since June 27, 1985, when Route 66 was decommissioned as a Federal highway, the popularity and mythical stature of Route 66 has grown domestically and internationally, as the road has experienced a rebirth of interest and support. (6) The year 2026 will be the centennial anniversary of Route 66, and a commission should be established to study and recommend to Congress activities that are fitting and proper to celebrate that anniversary in a manner that appropriately honors America’s Mother Road.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 66, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 66, the Route 66 Centennial Commission Act. I thank my colleague, Representative GRACE NAPOLITANO , for sponsoring this legislation with me, and I also thank Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member DEFAZIO for helping shepherd this bill to the floor, along with Highways and Transit Subcommittee chairman, Mr. GRAVES . I am proud to have Route 66 run through the middle of my district, and I believe it is important that we celebrate the history of Route 66. In 1926, Route 66 became our Nation’s first allpaved highway under the U.S. highway system, connecting Chicago, Illinois, to Santa Monica, California. Early on, the road was used by hundreds of thousands of Americans seeking to escape the Dust Bowl and provided critical employment opportunities for road crews paving the road during the Great Depression. During World War II, the highway transported troops, equipment, and supplies to military bases across our country and was used after the war by thousands of troops returning home to their families. By the 1950s, Route 66 began to see a rise in tourism and became the true symbol of American freedom and independence that we all know today. In April of last year, I went on an extended tour of Illinois’ stretch of the highway with my colleague Representative DARIN LAHOOD and also many State and local leaders. I had the opportunity to see the economic impact that the Mother Road brings to Illinois. It supports many jobs and key economic activity in small towns, and it helps to generate important revenue to support those small rural communities. For example, travelers along Route 66 in Illinois can see a giant pink elephant statue and other largerthanlife sculptures at the Pink Elephant Antique Mall in Livingston, Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as a matter of fact, my family and I were coming back to my hometown of Taylorville yesterday, and we stopped and had a great lunch at the Twistee Treat, which is attached to the Pink Elephant Antique Mall. So 
if you ever want to go there, they have great burgers. I happened to have a pork tenderloin sandwich that I probably shouldn’t have eaten, but it was really, really good, and topped it off, of course, with Twistee Treat’s famous ice cream. You can also, if you are traveling Route 66, stop and see a movie at the Wildey Theater in Edwardsville, Illinois. That originally opened in 1909. Or stop for an allday breakfast at Jungle Jim’s Cafe, a quintessential roadside diner in Springfield, Illinois. Those are just a few of the thousands of local businesses along Route 66 whose livelihoods depend upon the historic highway. You don’t even have to be in a car to ride along Route 66. The Illinois Route 66 Trail is a system of offroad paths for bikes, hikers, or anyone else looking to see the Mother Road in a different way. The centennial of this great highway will be an international celebration, and the State of Illinois will be ready to welcome travelers from around the world who want to experience the history and magic of this scenic byway. This bill, Mr. Speaker, will create a 19member commission to recommend activities to honor the 100th anniversary of the Mother Road in the year 2026. It also directs the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a plan to ensure the first allpaved U.S. highway connecting the Midwest to my colleague’s, Mrs. NAPOLITANO ’s, district in California will be preserved for many years to come. In doing this, the Secretary of Transportation will work with the Governors of the eight States that this historic highway passes through to develop a comprehensive preservation plan. H.R. 66 is endorsed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation; the Route 66 Road Ahead Partnership; the National Historic Route 66 Federation; Auto Club Enterprises, also known as AAA; and the Route 66 Alliance. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  their letters of support of the bill. 
NATIONAL TRUST FOR  HISTORIC PRESERVATION , July 16, 2018. DEAR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES : We appreciate this opportunity to present the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s perspective on H.R. 66, the Route 66 Centennial Commission Act, which is scheduled for House floor consideration today. The National Trust enthusiastically endorses this legislation and looks forward to its enactment this year. 
HISTORIC PRESERVATION  The National Trust for Historic Preservation is a privatelyfunded charitable, educational, and nonprofit organization chartered by Congress in 1949 to ‘‘facilitate public participation in historic preservation’’ and to further the purposes of federal historic preservation laws. The intent of Congress was for the National Trust ‘‘to mobilize and coordinate public interest, participation, and resources in the preservation and interpretation of sites and buildings.’’ With headquarters in Washington, D.C., nine field offices, 27 historic sites, more than one million members and supporters, and a national network of partners in states, territories, and the District of Columbia, the National Trust works to save America’s historic places and advocates for historic preservation as a fundamental value in programs and policies at all levels of government. H.R. 66, ROUTE 66 CENTENNIAL COMMISSION ACT  We appreciate Representative Rodney Davis’ leadership on this legislation to create a Route 66 Centennial Commission that recognizes and honors Route 66 on its centennial anniversary. Historic Route 66 stretches approximately 2,400 miles from Chicago, IL to Los Angeles, CA, passing through eight states and more than 300 communities. This vital transportation corridor between the Midwest and southern California has endured as a symbol of freedom and mobility while epitomizing a new optimism that pervaded the nation’s economic recovery following World War II. Route 66 was found by the National Park Service (NPS) to be nationally significant in its 1995 Route 66 Special Resource Study, which determined that Route 66 met the eligibility requirements for a National Historic Trail. Numerous buildings along Route 66 are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and a 2012 Multiple Property Documentation Form (MPDF) establishing the road’s national significance was recently approved by the Keeper of the National Register. Route 66 has been designated a National Scenic Byway in four states, including one segment that has been designated an All American Road—the highest designation offered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Route 66 is internationally recognized as representing America’s love of the automobile and open road. As a Dustbowl migration route, a World War II strategic military route, and a vacation travel route, it has been celebrated in music, literature, television, movies, and popular lore. The National Trust has been supportive of Route 66 preservation efforts for many years, including it in our signature National Treasures program, participating in symposiums, providing strategic assistance, and including Route 66 on the 2018 list of America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. When Congress passed the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program in 1999, a program administered by the National Park Service (NPS), Route 66 was described as a symbol of the American people’s heritage of travel and their legacy of seeking a better life. We applaud Representative Rodney Davis and the over 40 cosponsors of H.R. 66 for their commitment to recognizing the national significance of Route 66. Thank you again for the opportunity to present the National Trust’s perspectives on this legislation, and we look forward to working with Congress to ensure H.R. 66 is enacted into law this year. Sincerely, PAMBOWMAN , Director of Public Lands Policy. 
THERT. 66 R OADAHEAD PARTNERSHIP , March 7, 2018.

This legislation will help ensure activities that are fitting and proper to celebrate this milestone are planned and carried out in a way that appropriately honors America’s Mother Road. 2026 marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the U.S. Numbered Highway System and Route 66. The road was our nation’s first allpaved highway connecting the Midwest, starting in Illinois, and ending in California.

AUTOMOBILE CLUB OF  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA , Los Angeles, CA, January 17, 2017. Subject: H.R. 66—Route 66 Centennial Commission Act. HON. RODNEY DAVIS, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. THEHONORABLE CONGRESSMAN DAVIS: Auto Club Enterprises (AAA) applauds your leadership for introducing H.R. 66, which would form a commission tasked with celebrating Route 66’s centennial and direct that a preservation plan for the Route be prepared. Auto Club Enterprises represents the interests of our AAA members and motorists in five of the eight states represented in this proposal (California, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri and southern Illinois). Furthermore, the largest motor club within ACE, the Automobile Club of Southern California (ACSC), played a central role in the survey and signposting of the original highway that became Route 66: the National Old Trails Road, created in 1914–1915. ACSC published the first maps of the route and its signs guided travelers for the first decade of the road’s existence [both illustrations attached]. We are keenly aware of the strong historical connection between Route 66 and major trends in our nation’s history and travel and the history of the Southwest. Route 66 was one of our nation’s first all paved highways connecting the Midwest to California, and has played a major role in the history of the United States. It offered opportunity to hundreds of thousands of people seeking escape from the Dust Bowl in the 1930s, and its construction created jobs for thousands during the Great Depression. Route 66 represented America’s great optimism and enthusiasm during the postwar economic recovery. In this era, the tourism industry along Route 66 grew tremendously; giving rise to countless tourist courts, motels, service stations, garages, and diners. Because of its resonance within American history and culture, Route 66 has been the subject of memorable productions in all media, from popular music to television to movies. For all these reasons—its historical and cultural significance and its connection with our own history, Auto Club Enterprises supports the passage of H.R. 66. We look forward to working with you and other stakeholders in support of passing H.R. 66 and to our continued partnership after its passage to successfully implement its provisions. Sincerely, HAMID BAHADORI , Manager, Transportation Policy and Programs. 
THEROUTE 66 A LLIANCE , Tulsa, OK, February 8, 2018. Re H.R. 66. THEROUTE 66 R OAD AHEAD PARTNERSHIP : On behalf of the Route 66 Alliance, I am pleased to provide this letter of support for H.R. 66, which will establish a Route 66 100th Anniversary Commission at the Federal level. This legislation will help ensure activities that are fitting and proper to celebrate this milestone are planned and carried out in a manner that appropriately honors America’s Mother Road. 2026 marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the U.S. Numbered Highway System and Route 66. The road was our nation’s first allpaved highway connecting the Midwest, beginning in Illinois, and ending in California. Since the early decades of the 20th Century, Route 66 has reflected and been an integral part of American history. And Tulsa celebrates this legacy since the Father of Route 66, Cyrus Avery, led the effort to have Route 66 pass through Oklahoma, specifically Tulsa, where East meets West! Hundreds of thousands of people used Route 66 to escape the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, and many found employment along its path. The road also transported troops, equipment, and other military supplies across the country during the Second World War, and was used by thousands of troops as they returned home. In the 1950s and 1960s, Route 66 saw the rise of American tourism and became home to countless tourist attractions, motels, diners, and other businesses along its path. Today, Route 66 remains an iconic symbol of American freedom and of the U.S. as a mobile society. H.R. 66 will create a commission to recommend activities for the commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of Route 66. The bill also requires USDOT to develop a plan on the preservation needs of the road, and directs USDOT to host a conference on the U.S. Numbered Highway System. The Route 66 Alliance is dedicated to the preservation and promotion of Route 66, and is committed to helping ensure the road’s 100th Anniversary is planned and celebrated in a manner that recognizes its historic significance. For this reason, we strongly support H.R. 66. Best regards, KENBUSBY , Executive Director & CEO. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, throughout its history, Route 66 has become more than just a way to get from point A to point B. It has evolved into a symbol of American independence and prosperity. I am proud to help continue the legacy of Route 66, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 66. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 66, the Route 66 Centennial Commission Act. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman RODNEY DAVIS, for introducing this legislation with me; and I thank Chairman SHUSTER and Chairman GRAVES and Ranking Member DEFAZIO and Ranking Member N ORTON  for their support in moving this bill along through the committee. Route 66, as was pointed out, runs east to west through my district as Foothill Boulevard and Huntington Drive in the cities of La Verne, San Dimas, Azusa, Duarte, and Monrovia. Our local restaurants, shops, and businesses, like so many others dotting the interstate from the heartland to the West Coast, provide rest breaks for travelers, allowing them to sample the local flavors of our communities that are proud to be connected by the iconic road. Other cities are doing this as well. The city of Duarte celebrates every year in September with a parade of classic cars, equestrian groups, and marching bands. Along the highway, there are signs still there from long ago showing Route 66 lives there. The theme of the Los Angeles County Fair this year, which is a very popular fair, is Route 66, with memorabilia and Route 66 moviethemed nights. States and local governments across the country are reinvesting in Route 66 as an icon of American history and culture. The Federal Government should be involved in this effort as well. H.R. 66 creates a national commission to recommend activities to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Route 66 in 2026. The bill will also direct the Department of Transportation, as was pointed out, to develop a plan on the preservation needs of this iconic Route 66. The Department is required to consult with eight States through which Route 66 travels, which include California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois. Mr. Speaker, Route 66 is a significant part of America’s past, but it also continues to provide transportation, economic, and community benefits to our society today. We must continue to improve this historic road so that many more generations can, in the words of Chuck Berry, get their kicks on Route 66. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support Route 66, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1700 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my colleague Mrs. NAPOLITANO , and also my colleague Mr. LAHOOD, for going on the Route 66 tour and passing legislation through the Natural Resources Committee when he was a member of that committee to ensure that this Mother Road gets the recognition that it deserves when it turns 100 years old. I will tell you, you talk about economic impacts, this road has a tremendous impact in rural America and central Illinois. When I pulled into the Pink Elephant Antique Mall yesterday, it was tough to find a parking spot on a Sunday in Livingston, Illinois, when that town has 850 people who reside there. This is a big deal. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I yield to the gentlewoman from California. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. My communities, as of now, are very excited about this bill and the celebration of the 100th birthday. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEYDAVIS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 66, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
INNOVATIVE STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF 2018 Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3906) to establish centers of excellence for innovative stormwater control infrastructure, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3906 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Innovative Stormwater Infrastructure Act of 2018’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall establish a stormwater infrastructure funding task force composed of representatives of Federal, State, and local governments and private (including nonprofit) entities to conduct a study on, and develop recommendations to improve, the availability of public and private sources of funding for the construction, rehabilitation, and operation and maintenance of stormwater infrastructure to meet the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). (b) CONSIDERATIONS .—In carrying out subsection (a), the task force shall— (1) identify existing Federal, State, and local public sources and private sources of funding for stormwater infrastructure; and (2) consider— (A) how funding for stormwater infrastructure from such sources has been made available, and utilized, in each State to address stormwater infrastructure needs identified pursuant to section 516(b)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1375(b)(1)); (B) how the source of funding affects the affordability of the infrastructure (as determined based on the considerations used to assess the financial capability of municipalities under the integrated planning guidelines described in the Integrated Municipal Stormwater and Wastewater Planning Approach Framework, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency on June 5, 2012, and dated May, 2012), including consideration of the costs associated with financing the infrastructure; and (C) whether such sources of funding are sufficient to support capital expenditures and long term operation and maintenance costs necessary to meet the stormwater infrastructure needs of municipalities. (c) REPORT .—Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report that describes the results of the study conducted, and the recommendations developed, under subsection (a). (d) STATE DEFINED .—In this section, the term ‘‘State’’ has the meaning given that term in section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1362). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLI TANO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous on H.R. 3906, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, BILL SHUSTER ; the ranking member, Congressman DEFAZIO; and my good friend the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mrs. NAPOLITANO , for their work in progressing this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, as we know, with the additional development that is occurring in this country, with the additional water and stormwater systems that are being built, heavy rains end up transiting or transferring pollutants, heavy metals, trash, bacteria, and many other things into our water system. Mr. Speaker, I represent south Louisiana. The watershed that I represent drains from Montana to two Canadian provinces to New York. It is one of the largest watersheds in the world. Of course, all of that stormwater runoff ends up coming down right through my home State and contributes to one of the largest dead zones in the Nation— in fact, the largest dead zone in the Nation—which is not very compatible with us having some of the top commercial and recreational fishing and one of the largest or most productive estuaries in the United States. So I want to thank Mr. HECKfor introducing this legislation, for working with Congressman KATKO in putting this together in a bipartisan manner. What this legislation does is it recognizes that stormwater runoff does actually transfer, or does contribute to pollutants, in our waterways, and it recognizes that this is a problem. But it also recognizes that it is a problem that needs to be solved by local, by State, and by Federal agencies, by Federal officials. So this legislation creates a new task force to look at innovative financing, to look at new funding streams, to look at how we can do a better job integrating the various funding streams to actually achieve this objective that we all share on a bipartisan basis to help reduce the amount of pollutants and trash and other things that get into our waterways. This is an important step forward. Mr. Speaker, in a previous life, I managed a large infrastructure program where we built tens of billions of dollars of infrastructure. One of the first things I realized is how important it was for us to look at all the funding streams that are available, and the possible funding streams that are available, pulling those together to make sure that they are being used in a complementary manner, not managed in silos, and certainly not managed in a contradictory or in a conflicting manner. The gentleman’s legislation helps to address that. It helps look at the revenue streams that are available today, whether they are Federal, whether they are State, whether they are local funds, or perhaps even private or not forprofit, looking at the different regulatory structures that are out there, looking at opportunities for us to achieve this bipartisan goal of reducing pollutants, of helping reduce trash, of helping reduce the dead zone and other adverse outcomes as a result of stormwater runoff from heavy rains. Again, I want to point out that this is bipartisan legislation, that this passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee unanimously, that my good friend from California Mrs. NAPOLITANO worked with us on changes in the committee. I thank, again, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK) and Mr. K ATKO for working together on something that is an important issue, for coming up with a bipartisan solution, and looking forward to ensuring that this passes the House and passes the Senate as well to where we can get it to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, because I rise in support of H.R. 3906, the Innovative Stormwater Infrastructure Act of 2018. This bipartisan bill, as was pointed out, was introduced by our colleague from Washington, Congressman HECK, aimed at addressing one of the ongoing concerns facing our communities, an unfunded mandate—very unfunded: how to address and pay for controlling ongoing sources of stormwater that empty into our local water bodies. According to EPA, runoff from urbanized areas is a leading source of water quality impairments on local water bodies. In urban and suburban areas, buildings and pavement cover much of the land and prevent rain and snowmelt from soaking into the ground. Instead, these developed areas rely on storm drains to carry large amounts of water runoff from roofs and paved areas to nearby waterways, and with it, as was pointed out again, high levels of pollution, such as oil, dirt, chemicals, and lawn fertilizers released directly into local streams and rivers. Congress needs to do more to help communities come into compliance with the goals of the Clean Water Act, the unfunded mandate. We need to encourage the development of new technologies and practices for addressing stormwater runoff. We need to encourage the implementation of costeffective, lowimpact development and naturebased infrastructure alternatives. 
Finally, we need to provide additional Federal assistance to communities to help address their local water quality challenges. Many of the communities are small and could not afford them. It will bankrupt them if they have to follow the letter of the law. Mr. Speaker, while H.R. 3906, as introduced, would have addressed some of these challenges, the bill was modified by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. This modification removed the authorization of a new EPA stormwater grant program and replaced it with a new study on how existing sources of Federal, State, local, and private funds are being used to address local stormwater challenges. As amended, H.R. 3906 would direct the EPA administration to partner with Federal, State, and local agencies and stakeholders in the creation of a new stormwater infrastructure funding task force. This new task force will look at funding and affordability issues related to the construction, rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of the stormwater infrastructure necessary to meet the goals of the Clean Water Act. The task force will be required to inventory the available public and private sources of funding for stormwater infrastructure and to assess how the use of these sources of funding might affect the affordability of the infrastructure to a municipality, which sometimes is floundering. While there may be several financing options available to communities to address local stormwater challenges, the actual cost of these options to a community may vary greatly. For example, it is far cheaper for a community to obtain a Federal grant for water infrastructure than a loan, but it may also be more affordable for a community to borrow from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund than to borrow the same amount from the private market. So the question is not simply about whether funding is available to the community, but is that funding also affordable to the community. I expect that the results of the task force will show how the Federal Government needs to be an active player in financing affordable stormwater infrastructure. Perhaps this information will guide future Congresses to take a greater role in financing our water infrastructure challenges. Mr. Speaker, while I am disappointed that this legislation does not provide additional Federal resources so desperately needed to address our local water infrastructure challenges, the bill is a very good first step in further refining the scope of the stormwater challenges facing our Nation. I am pleased to support the bill, and I heartily urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK). Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, pretty simply put, this bill is about addressing the single largest source of water pollution in America, which is stormwater runoff. It is a nationwide issue from D.C., to Los Angeles, to Milwaukee, to Louisiana. But it is also one that is acutely felt in my home State of Washington, because there, it really does rain a lot. When that rain falls, the rain runs off the roofs. The rain runs down the streets. The rain runs into the storm drainage system. Along the way, it picks up all sorts of nasty, toxic stuff that has been alluded to earlier, stuff like fertilizers, metals, oils, and pesticides. That stuff, all that bad stuff, runs into our lakes and our rivers and, ultimately, in my region of the country, into Puget Sound, which is the largest estuary, by water volume, in the United States. It has been estimated by scientists that stormwater accounts for up to 80 percent of all water pollution. Gone are the days of the easyfix solutions of pointsource pollution, where we could just pass a law saying: You can’t do that anymore. Figure it out. This is a lot more difficult. It is a lot more decentralized. It is a lot more pervasive. Frankly, it is no less harmful. And it hurts not just our environment. Let’s be clear, this hurts our businesses as well, especially those that depend on clean water. In our State, we have a robust shellfish industry that employs thousands of people. Stormwater can kill a salmon in a matter of hours. We actually have timelapse films from underwater showing this, and it is not very much time that has elapsed. This isn’t something where they ingest the metal, and then months or years later they die. You can literally watch them die as the stormwater hits the water. And they are fundamental. Salmon are fundamental to the economy and the culture of the Pacific Northwest and especially to the Native people, who have depended on them since time immemorial. Salmon support, in fact, in our region of the country, a $30 billion a year economy. Salmon are also the prey of choice of our beloved southern resident orcas, which we are precariously close to losing altogether. Frankly, we can’t save the orcas if we don’t save the salmon, and we can’t save the salmon if we don’t save Puget Sound, and we can’t save Puget Sound if we don’t deal with stormwater runoff. Every region has its own story. The gentleman from Louisiana told his most eloquently, and I thank him, about how stormwater is punishing our waterways and, along with it, our way of life and our economy. That is why State and local governments are implementing green stormwater infrastructure, like rain gardens and permeable pavement, and are building new gray stormwater infrastructure to reduce combined sewer outflows. But that is not enough. It is not enough by a long shot. b1715 State and local governments are stretched thin, and that is why we need the Federal Government to step up and do its partnership role in this. Back in my State, we estimate that the stormwater problem could be solved with $19 billion in investment between now and 2036; and, frankly, almost all of that is in the Puget Sound region, 98 percent. That is a lot of money and that is why H.R. 3906 is an important first step to help the experts and the stakeholders come together and come up with innovative ways not to be duplicative and to think outside the box. Mr. Speaker, I conclude by thanking Chairman SHUSTER ; Ranking Member DEFAZIO; along with Subcommittee Chairman GRAVES ; Ranking Member NAPOLITANO ; my colleague and my friend from New York, Congressman KATKO ; and their staffs for their work on this bill. I appreciate their help to bring greater attention to the problem of stormwater runoff. But let’s be clear: We have to do more; we have to do a lot more. I look forward to continuing to work with the committee to increase the Federal Government’s partnership role in tackling this urgent threat, which, again, is the number one cause of water pollution in America. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, just one last word, I think this is a very important bill. We have been dealing with the stormwater issue for at least 7 years in my area, and because it is an unfunded mandate, the cities are crying out for help. I think the two cases set forth by my colleagues point out the need for Federal help. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, Congressman HECKrecently brought up the shellfish industry. Just this week, the Louisiana Oyster Task Force is coming to town. We are going to be meeting with them, talking to them about this and a number of other priority issues because their industry has been impacted by water quality and many other challenges. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that this legislation helps to make sure that all of the various levels of government, together with our nongovernment partners in the private sector and the not forprofit organizations that are out 
there, that we are all working together; that we are ensuring that the regulatory structure that is out there is actually complementary to this effort to help ensure clean water not just now, but for generations to come; that we are using better technology; that we are using better mechanisms, such as vegetative plantings and buffers and other things, to ensure that we are not polluting our waters but that we are cleaning them; that we have safe drinking water; that we have safe, productive ecosystems for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Congressman HECK, Congressman KATKO , my friend Congresswoman NAPOLITANO , and many others who were involved in this legislation. This is going to help us to ensure that the various funding streams that are out there, that we are using them in a complementary manner, not in a stovepipe manner. Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 3906, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3906, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a stormwater infrastructure funding task force, and for other purposes.’’ A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
J. MARVIN JONES FEDERAL BUILDING AND MARY LOU ROBINSON UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5772) to designate the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, as the ‘‘J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5772 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse located at 205 SE 5th Ave., Amarillo, Texas, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse’’. 
Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the Federal building and United States courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5772. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5772 would designate the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, as the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse. Judge Robinson was a legal pioneer, paving the way for women in what was once a maledominated profession. In 1973, Judge Robinson was appointed justice of the Seventh Court of Appeals in Amarillo, Texas, making her the first female appellate judge in Texas. Four years later, she was appointed to chief justice of the same court. Five years later, President Carter appointed Robinson to a Federal judgeship as the second woman to serve as a United States district judge in Texas. For over 60 years, Judge Robinson was a pioneer, a scholar, and, above all, a judge of fairness and integrity. I support naming this Federal building and courthouse after her. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I join the chairman in supporting H.R. 5772, which designates the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, as the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse. The new designation is a welldeserved honor for Judge Mary Lou Robinson. You have heard some description of her outstanding career. Let me add a few more points. She has served as a judge in Amarillo, Texas, for more than 63 years, with 35 years on the Federal judiciary. When she took senior status as a Federal judge in 2016, she became the longest serving Federal judge in both the Northern District of Texas and the entire Fifth Circuit. Judge Robinson received numerous awards throughout her career for both her legal and her public service to the community. She was named one of the 100 Legal Legends by Texas Lawyer, the 2016 Jurist of the Year by the Texas Chapters of American Board of Trial Advocates, and the 1973 Texas Woman of the Year by the Texas Federation of Business and Professional Women, among other awards. Her colleagues reported that she had a reputation for running an orderly and efficient courtroom, and she treated celebrity trials the same way she treated mundane 2day civil cases. Judge Robinson certainly served with distinction during her time on the Federal bench. She was deeply respected by the Amarillo legal community, and I am pleased to support this legislation which aptly names the facility in her honor. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Pennsylvania yielding and the support of the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentlewoman from Nevada for this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I introduced this legislation with a near unanimous request of the legal community and the broader leadership in the Texas Panhandle. Since 1980, the Federal building and courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, has been known as the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building. Judge Jones led a remarkable life. He served in this House from 1917 to 1940, including as chair of the Committee on Agriculture. He was then appointed to the court of claims, took a leave of absence to serve in the Roosevelt administration during World War II, and went back to the court of claims, where he was the chief judge there from 1947 until his retirement in 1964. As I said, it was a remarkable life, but there is another remarkable life that has made a lasting impact on the cause of justice in the Northern District of Texas, and it has also been an inspirational life. Judge Mary Lou Robinson has served as a judge, as Members have heard, for more than 60 years, more than 35 years of which has been as a Federal district judge in the Northern District of Texas. She is a pioneer: She attended and graduated law school at the University of Texas at a time when very few women applied or were admitted to the law school at all. When she went into private practice in Amarillo, she was one of two female attorneys practicing there. In 1955, Judge Robinson became the first woman in Amarillo history to serve as a judge higher than the justice of the peace level and was the first Potter County court at law judge. Up until that time in Texas, women could not serve on juries. She was elected State district court judge in 1960. As you have heard, in 1973, she became an associate justice of the Seventh State Court of Appeals, making 
her the first female appellate judge in the entire State of Texas. She later became the chief justice of that court. In 1979, Judge Robinson was nominated and confirmed to the Federal bench, again being only the second woman to serve as a U.S. district judge in Texas. Then, day in and day out, for nearly 40 years, Judge Robinson presided over Federal and criminal cases with fairness and with high expectations fitting the American legal system. She took senior judge status in 2016. As Members have heard, she has been honored repeatedly, such as the Sandra Day O’Connor Award for Professional Excellence from the Texas Center for Legal Ethics and the Texas Lawyer magazine’s one of 100 Legal Legends in the State. But I will say, Mr. Speaker, that Judge Mary Lou Robinson’s influence extends even further than the trailblazing and remarkable longevity that her legal career would indicate. Throughout it all, Judge Robinson has upheld the highest standards of legal ethics and professionalism, being a role model not only for those in the legal system, but for men and women throughout the region. She is fair, but she is tough. And here I can speak from a bit of personal experience that no lawyer wanted to go unprepared into her courtroom. With her razorsharp intellect and knowledge of the law, she was always well prepared and probably knew more about the law of the case than the lawyers arguing it. No one ever doubted that all sides of the case would get a fair hearing. At the same time, those who know her off the bench know her to have a great sense of humor, compassion, and a warm human touch. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5772 would add Judge Mary Lou Robinson’s name to the Federal building and courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, so that it would be known as the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse. Marvin Jones served in all three branches of our Federal Government. Judge Robinson has served in the judicial branch of the State and Federal Government for more than 60 years. This designation honors each of them in a way that is fitting to each of them. Adding Judge Robinson’s name to that of Marvin Jones will not only honor the careers of two remarkable individuals, it will help inspire all of us to reach toward their high standards of integrity, professionalism, and service to our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I say again that we are most impressed by the two people whose names are on this Federal building, and I urge my colleagues to support the designation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5772. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
JOHN HERVEY WHEELER UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3460) to designate the United States courthouse located at 323 East Chapel Hill Street in Durham, North Carolina, as the ‘‘John Hervey Wheeler United States Courthouse’’, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3460 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The United States courthouse located at 323 East Chapel Hill Street in Durham, North Carolina, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘John Hervey Wheeler United States Courthouse’’ during the period in which the facility is used as a Federal courthouse. (b) REFERENCES .—During the period in which the facility referred to in subsection (a) is used as a Federal courthouse, any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘John Hervey Wheeler United States Courthouse’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. b1730 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 3460, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 3460 would designate the United States courthouse located in Durham, North Carolina, as the John Hervey Wheeler United States Courthouse. Mr. Wheeler played a pivotal role in the civil rights movement. John Wheeler was a respected civil rights leader in Durham, North Carolina, successfully litigating school segregation cases in the 1940s. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Mr. Wheeler to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission where he worked alongside Vice President Johnson in drafting civil rights legislation. Mr. Wheeler also served as president of the Mechanics & Farmers Bank where he was able to continue his work on civil rights issues, making possible the purchase of homes, the acquisition of Federal loans, and a relaxation of racial barriers in North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I think it is fitting to name the courthouse in Durham after him. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 3460. This is the bill, as you heard, that would name the United States Federal courthouse located in downtown Durham, North Carolina, as the John Hervey Wheeler United States Courthouse. Mr. Wheeler was a prominent community leader. He was a bank president and he was a civil rights lawyer who helped transform the city of Durham over his long and impressive career. Clearly, it is appropriate to name this courthouse after him. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD ) who brought us this legislation and can speak more personally about the qualities of Mr. Wheeler. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) for her friendship, leadership, and for yielding me the time this afternoon. I also thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) as well. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 3460, that seeks to name the United States courthouse located at 323 East Chapel Hill Street in Durham, North Carolina, as the John Hervey Wheeler United States Courthouse. This bill, Mr. Speaker, has the support from my friends in the North Carolina congressional delegation and the entire Durham community. It was favorably reported out of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee several days ago. John Hervey Wheeler, Mr. Speaker, was a prominent African American bank president, civil rights lawyer, political activist, civic leader, educator, statesman, and philanthropist. He was a family friend as well. Mr. Wheeler was born on the campus of Kittrell College in Vance County, North Carolina, on New Year’s Day in 1908, as the second child to the former Margaret Hervey and John Leonidas Wheeler. After the Wheeler family relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, John Wheeler attended high school at Morehouse Academy from 1921 to 1925, and then matriculated to Morehouse College from 1925 to 1929, where he graduated summa cum laude in June of 1929. After graduation, Mr. Wheeler moved to Durham where he began his career 
with the Mechanics & Farmers Bank as a bank teller. He advanced through the company’s ranks and in 1944, became executive vice president. Eight years later, Mr. Wheeler would become bank president. At the age of 44, he was the youngest African American bank president in the country. As president, Mr. Wheeler saw the bank grow from operating branches in two cities, Durham and Raleigh, to also having a branch in Charlotte. During his tenure the bank’s assets grew from $5 million to $41 million. John Wheeler, Mr. Speaker, was instrumental in making loans to hundreds of families in North Carolina, enabling them to purchase their homes. He made loans to churches and businesses, loans they otherwise would not have been able to obtain because of discriminatory lending practices. John Wheeler was eager to become a lawyer. He enrolled in law school at the North Carolina College for Negroes, now North Carolina Central University, where in 1947 he was among the first law school graduates. John Wheeler became a thoughtful activist through his involvement known as the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, a communitybased civil and political organization founded in Durham in 1935. Mr. Wheeler began serving as chairman in 1957, a position he held until 1978. The organization continues today as the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People. During my entire time in Durham, Mr. Speaker, as a student at North Carolina Central University, John Wheeler was a titan of a community leader, well respected, and effective. On many occasions, he personally counseled me by providing advice that I recall to this day. It was through the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs that Attorney Wheeler and Attorney M. Hugh Thompson and Attorney Oliver Hill of Richmond, Virginia, challenged several North Carolina school boards by alleging they were failing to provide equal funding to African American schools. It was a constitutional challenge. In the case of Blue v. Durham Public School District filed on May 18, 1949, Wheeler, Thompson, and Hill were successful in proving that the Durham Public School District was violating the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court entered its order and I have a copy with me today, Mr. Speaker. I will simply read one sentence: 
The net result of what has been done leaves Negro school children at many disadvantages which must be overcome. 
The court ordered equal funding for the schools on January 26, 1951, in the very building we are naming today. Incidentally, Mr. Speaker, the State courthouse in Richmond, Virginia, is named for his cocounsel, Oliver Hill. In my home county of Wilson, also in 1949, Black residents employed Attorney Wheeler to represent them in a similar lawsuit because the Wilson County School Board refused to build any public schools in the rural portions of the county for African American children. Mr. Wheeler won that case as well, and because of the litigation, two consolidated schools were constructed. Thousands of African American children in Wilson County benefited by obtaining a high school education. Mr. Wheeler ultimately filed several school desegregation lawsuits before the end of the decade. In 1956, he and several other Durham attorneys, including future CORE chairman, Floyd B. McKissick, Sr., won the U.S. Supreme Court case of Frasier v. Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina, which led to the first three African American undergraduates to gain admission to our State’s flagship institution. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed John Wheeler to the President’s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. In 1963, Mr. Wheeler became an incorporator of the North Carolina Fund, an ambitious antipoverty agency established by thenGovernor Terry Sanford to help eradicate poverty. Mr. Wheeler joined the organization’s board, and his bank became the repository for its accounts. In 1964, thenGovernor Terry Sanford named John Wheeler as a delegate to the Democratic Party’s national convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Mr. Wheeler was the first African American in North Carolina to be a convention delegate. That same year, Mr. Wheeler became the first African American President of the Southern Regional Council, a civil rights organization founded in 1944 and based in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1967, John Wheeler received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse College for his tireless leadership as a member of the school’s board of trustees. He had previously received honorary doctorates from Shaw University in Raleigh, Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, and Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama. In 1970, Mr. Wheeler was awarded an honorary doctorate from Duke University, and that same year received the Frank Porter Graham civil liberties award for his defense of freedom for all North Carolinians. In 1971, North Carolina Central University, my alma mater, also honored him with an honorary doctorate degree. On January 4, 1976, Morehouse College formally dedicated the John H. Wheeler Hall as the school’s social sciences and business administration building. On December 25, Christmas Day, in 1935, Mr. Wheeler married the former Selena Lucille Warren, the daughter of Julia McCauley and Dr. Stanford L. Warren, a cofounder and onetime president of the Mechanics & Farmers Bank. They had two children, Julia Taylor and Warren Hervey Wheeler. Mr. Wheeler passed away 40 years ago on July 6, 1978, at the age of 70. Mr. Speaker, in closing, John Hervey Wheeler gave so much of himself to his community, State, and country. He accomplished more in his time on Earth than some could hope to accomplish in two lifetimes. It is for these reasons that I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 3460, to direct that the United States courthouse be named in his honor. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. BUTTERFIELD , for sharing with us that amazing life story. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3460, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
GEORGE P. KAZEN FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2734) to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 1300 Victoria Street in Laredo, Texas, as the ‘‘George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2734 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. GEORGE P. KAZEN FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The Federal building and United States courthouse located at 1300 Victoria Street in Laredo, Texas, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the Federal building and United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 2734. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 2734 would designate the Federal building and the United States courthouse located in Laredo, Texas, as the George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Judge Kazen was appointed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas by President Carter in 1979. He served as chief judge from 1996 to 2003, and assumed senior status in 2009. In March of this year, he retired from the bench. Prior to his appointment as a Federal judge, Judge Kazen was in private practice for 14 years. Earlier in his career, he served in the United States Air Force as a captain and judge advocate. In addition, Judge Kazen has been an adjunct professor of law at St. Mary’s University School of Law and served as judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Given Judge Kazen’s service, I think it is more than fit to name this Federal building and courthouse after him. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of S. 2734 which designates the Federal building and United States courthouse located in Laredo, Texas, as the George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse. I would like to commend Congressman CUELLAR , our colleague from Texas, who introduced the House companion to this bill, H.R. 5280, that also has bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ), to share with us the impressive story of Judge Kazen’s legal and public career. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I first of all want to thank the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) for the great leadership that she has provided in the committee and in the House also. I also want to thank my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) for his leadership and for the great service that he has provided the country here in the U.S. Congress. This particular bill means a lot to my district. I also want to thank, before I forget, the members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for unanimous support of this particular bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2734, a bill which would designate the Federal courthouse located in my district at 1300 Victoria Street in Laredo, Texas, as the George P. Kazen Building and United States Courthouse. b1745 Judge Kazen was born in Laredo, Texas, on February 29—a leap year—in 1940. He received his law degree with honors from the University of Texas School of Law in 1961. Shortly after graduation, he served a term as a brief attorney for the Texas Supreme Court and entered the United States Air Force as a JAG officer, where he was awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal also. Judge Kazen would return back to the city of Laredo in 1965, where he practiced law until he was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to become a United States district judge in 1979 for the Southern District of Texas. During his many years of service in the courtroom, he was known as an honest, humble, and dedicated individual. He was also among the most respected judges in the State and in the country, and consistently ruled with class and fairness, all while still making time to serve numerous civic organizations throughout south Texas. Judge Kazen recently retired after almost 40 years of service on the bench. I am pleased to have this opportunity to honor him and say that this is an outstanding individual and a very noble individual. Dedicating this Federal building and courthouse would serve as a reminder to all of us of this great man of character who served his community and his country for so many years. Also, I want to convey my legislative intent for this bill that the central jury assembly room on the first floor of this courthouse be known as the Marcel C. Notzon II Jury Room. Judge Notzon was born on August 24, 1935, in Laredo. His love for the law and justice spanned a legal career over 39 years, with almost a quarter century on the bench as the United States magistrate judge for the Southern District of Texas. Judge Kazen, the man whom this building will be named after, would call Judge Notzon the ‘‘heart of the courthouse.’’ Judge Notzon, who just recently passed away, will be most remembered as a portrait of a beloved and compassionate public servant and for a full life he served in accordance with the rule of law. In particular, I want to thank Senator J OHN CORNYN and Senator C RUZ for helping to bring this bill to the floor in the Senate and successfully passing the Senate, and all my Texas colleagues, all 36 Members from Texas in the House, for also supporting this piece of legislation that would honor George P. Kazen throughout this earned gesture. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to show their support for this bill to name the Federal courthouse located at 1300 Victoria Street in Laredo, Texas, as the George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse. I want to thank Ms. TITUS and Mr. BARLETTA for their work and their support, and their staff also, and the committee. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleague Mr. CUELLAR for helping explain why it is even more important for us to name this building for Judge Kazen. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2734. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PROMOTING FLOOD RISK MITIGATION ACT Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R 5846) to require the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study regarding the buyout practices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5846 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Promoting Flood Risk Mitigation Act’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5846, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5846, as amended, the Promoting Flood Risk Mitigation Act, requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study and issue a report to Congress regarding the flood buyout practices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The removal of homes and buildings that have been repeatedly flooded to avoid future disaster damages and losses is a critical mitigation technique. These mitigation measures not only save lives but also reduce disaster costs by minimizing the risk of future damage from disasters. Studies have shown that for every $1 invested in mitigation, there is a potential savings of $4 to $8, because of damages avoided. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5846, the Promoting Flood Risk Mitigation Act, as amended. This bill was brought to us by my colleague from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study of the efficacy of buyouts of flood prone property acquired by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and examine ways to streamline funding to provide more timely assistance to a larger number of State and local governments. One only needs to look at last year’s hurricane season to see the devastating impacts of these intense storms that were caused by climate change and what they did to our communities. Unfortunately for many residents, the damage and destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria were not occurring for the first time but for a second or third time. These homes have been flooded and then had to be repaired with Federal assistance. In order to stop this endless repairing and rebuilding of homes in floodplain areas, we must find ways to encourage more homeowners to agree to having their homes bought out, as well as ways to encourage State and local governments to purchase more of these properties. The bill before you requires the GAO to assess the feasibility of a pilot program that, in exchange for a credit on their flood insurance premiums, property owners would be able to agree, before a flood occurs, to have their residence bought out if their residence is later substantially damaged by flood. The study would also examine the role that nonprofit organizations could play in making buyouts more readily available and more efficient. We must stop the cycle of destroy, rebuild, destroy, rebuild. This study is a good first step to assess the benefits of buyouts and the feasibility of potential solutions. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), who is the ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, to further discuss this. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and the gentlewoman from Nevada from the committee of jurisdiction on this issue. During the markup of the National Flood Insurance Program, a number of us suggested that perhaps there is a way to help this bankrupt program save substantial funds. Right now, the program is $20 billion in debt, and we have a temporary extension from the March omnibus that expires in July. The issue is that 2 percent of the properties in America have accounted for 24 percent of the spending by the National Flood Insurance Program. More than 30,000 of them have flooded five times each and been rebuilt by the 
bankrupt Federal Flood Insurance Program. Some have flooded more than 30 times. This is insanity, that we would keep rebuilding in these floodprone areas, rebuilding, rebuilding, rebuilding, and piling up debt and raising the insurance premiums for everybody else on the program who presents way less risk. So we decided that a way to go would be to provide a significant incentive to these people, and the incentive would be that they would have an agreed upon contract with FEMA to purchase their property at preflood market value, and they would also get a discount on their Federal flood insurance. So they get the discount on the insurance and have entered into an agreement to sell the property to FEMA at the full market price. FEMA would remove the structures, and it would be turned into open space that would continue to flood repeatedly, but we wouldn’t have to pay anything to rebuild it. We proposed that. The House Republicans said, oh, they thought it would be too expensive. We don’t know if it would be too expensive. It is 2 percent and 24 percent of the costs. I don’t think it is going to be more expensive. I think it is going to save a heck of a lot of money. So this bill would have the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, study this proposal and set up a pilot program to see if, indeed, it would facilitate cost savings and avoid the repeated rebuilding of floodprone structures and have willing takers on the other side. The other real incentive is that, if someone has finally tired of it the fifth time their house was flooded and they want out, that process now takes 2 to 5 years and involves a whole lot of negotiations over value, preflood value, and all that sort of thing. Here you get an agreedupon preflood value; you get a discount on your flood insurance; and you just walk away. FEMA will take care of the rest, the removal of the rubble and turning that into open space. So I think this would be one thing we need to do to help the Federal Flood Insurance Program, which is critical. Thirtyfour thousand people in my State have it. I have had Federal insurance; I don’t have it anymore. But this is a critical program for many, many people who are only very, very occasionally going to be flooded, but they can’t get a mortgage unless they have flood insurance. Mr. Speaker, I recommend this bill strongly to my colleagues. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ). Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work on this bill. I thank the gentlewoman from Nevada for her work on this bill. It is a bipartisan bill because it makes commonsense. So whether it is DEFAZIO or B LUMENAUER or D UFFY —go down the list of different people who have worked on it—they have worked on something that makes eminent commonsense, and I want to thank them for their efforts. The saying is: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. But the corollary to that is: If it is broken, fix it. What we have just heard are any number of different conversations about the degree to which the buyout program is not just a little bit broken but a whole lot broken. First off, just at an individual level, it captures people in a hamster wheel that they can never get out of. If you look at the average buyout time, it is about 5 years. In that 5year time period, people are stuck there waiting and waiting and waiting as their house, in many cases, refloods. I have been to Shadowmoss in the West Ashley section of Charleston. I remember going in there after a flood. Those people who had a second story had carried stuff up to the second story. Those who didn’t were just dealing with the flooding as it occurred on the first floor. But they had been repeatedly flooded. So at an individual level, this makes sense for the remedy that it offers an individual, so they are not stuck in a house that is repeatedly flooding, as they are trapped in dealing with that. It makes sense based on what Mother Nature is telling us. My colleague from Nevada mentioned this notion of climate change. I don’t know exactly what is going on, but I know that in Charleston, South Carolina, if you compare the 1950s with the present day, there is 10 times more flooding in what they call king tides, and it has become regular. Something is going on out there that says this buyout program needs to be adjusted, and it needs to be adjusted now. The final point I would make is that this makes, as has been registered thus far, a whole lot of sense for the taxpayer, because if you look at the numbers, again, 30,000 homes in America have been flooded five or more times with substantial consequence to the taxpayer. We are talking about $5.5 billion being spent by the taxpayer in rebuilding and repairing. Destroy and repair is the term my colleague from Nevada used. The destroyandrepair, destroyandrepair cycle is destructive for the taxpayer. It is for that reason that everybody from the State floodplain managers to the National Association of Realtors to the Nature Conservancy has supported this measure. I cannot endorse it enough, and I thank the gentleman for his work on it. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge passage of this legislation and all the bills that we have brought before you today from this subcommittee. I want to thank our chairman, Mr. BARLETTA , for working with us across the aisle on these bipartisan bills. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1800 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 5846, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5846, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REINSTATING AND EXTENDING DEADLINE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT INVOLVING GIBSON DAM Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 490) to reinstate and extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project involving the Gibson Dam. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 490 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REINSTATEMENT AND EXTENSION OF TIME FOR FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION PROJECT INVOLVING GIBSON DAM. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Notwithstanding the time period specified in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project numbered 12478–003, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (referred to in this section as the ‘‘Commission’’) may, at the request of the licensee for the project, and after reasonable notice, in accordance with the good faith, due diligence, and public interest requirements of, and the procedures of the Commission under, that section, extend the time period during which the licensee is required to commence construction of the project for not more than 3 consecutive 2year periods from the date of the expiration of the extension originally issued by the Commission. (b) REINSTATEMENT OF EXPIRED LICENSE .— (1) IN GENERAL .—If the period required for the commencement of construction of the project described in subsection (a) has expired prior to the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission may reinstate the license effective as of that date of expiration. (2) EXTENSION .—If the Commission reinstates the license under paragraph (1), the first extension authorized under subsection (a) shall take effect on the date of that expiration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the RECORD  on the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill, S. 490, authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, upon request, to extend by 6 years the time period during which construction must commence on a hydroelectric project involving the Gibson Dam, which is located on the Sun River in Montana. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is expired. This bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent back on June 28, and I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation so that we can send it to the President’s desk. I would also note that when the Senate passed this bill, they also passed five other House bills extending construction licenses for hydro projects in North Carolina, New York, Virginia, and West Virginia. These now have become law. So this is the last one. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 490. This bipartisan legislation, sponsored by Senators STEVE DAINES , JON TESTER , and J IMRISCH, would reinstate and extend the deadline for the construction of a hydroelectric project on the Gibson Dam in Augusta, Montana. Congressman GIANFORTE of Montana introduced companion legislation last year. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission licensed the project in 2014, but the developer was unable to commence construction before the statutory deadlines passed. S. 490 is substantially similar to legislation that, during the previous Congress, was reported unanimously by the Energy and Commerce Committee and passed the House with 410 votes. I know of no objections to the bill on this side of the aisle, and I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in support of S. 490. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ). I would note that he was the sponsor of the House companion bill. This is a Senate bill that we are taking up, but, obviously, he has great interest in it. I would note that we passed it with strong bipartisan support through the Energy Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, the Bureau of Reclamation built the original Gibson Dam on the Sun River between 1926 and 1929. The dam has served to capture spring snowmelt for irrigation and to prevent flooding in the region. This bill would extend the FERC license to build a 15megawatt turbine at the base of the existing Gibson Dam. The ability to produce clean energy off Gibson Dam will benefit the county and the State by creating a new source of revenue. Furthermore, the construction of the powerhouse will bring jobs to Montana. Finally, the turbine will be built in such a way that helps the environment and enhances fish and wildlife opportunities. By granting an extension of this permit, we are giving a community in Montana a chance to create jobs and a benefit to the environment. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the record. We were going to take this up and pass it like that, but the Senate acted first, which is why we are taking up the Senate bill. It does have bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 490. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
OVERTHECOUNTER MONOGRAPH SAFETY, INNOVATION, AND REFORM ACT OF 2018 Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5333) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to clarify the regulatory framework with respect to certain nonprescription drugs that are marketed without an approved new drug application, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the RECORD  on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5333, the OvertheCounter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act. Overthecounter medications are widely used to treat common ailments such as colds, headaches, and seasonal allergies. In fact, more than 240 million Americans use OTC products every year and trust these affordable remedies to get well and stay well. Despite the success and high utilization of these medicines, the Food and Drug Administration’s regulatory framework for oversight of OTC products, also called the monograph system, is outdated and incomplete. The system was created more than 45 years ago, yet movement on unfinished items has ground to a halt due to the cumbersome notice and comment rulemaking process. I will give an example that was pointed out in committee that the FDA brought out. The FDA advanced notice proposed rulemaking for this one started on December 4, 1979. Through a process of 20 different procedures they went through, they got to November 19, 1997, almost 18 years later, and what do they do? They reopen the administrative records to consider new data. It is taking too long. That is what this bill would remedy. The lack of modernization makes it impossible for manufacturers to address safety concerns and offers little incentive to develop new products. H.R. 5333, which I introduced with the Health Subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS); the Health Subcommittee vice chairman, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ); the Health Subcommittee ranking member, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ), the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ); and the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ) would provide meaningful and long overdue reform to FDA’s monograph system. The necessary reforms would create a more flexible framework that accounts for advances in science, permits timely updates to safety information and label changes, and creates a workable process for completing unfinished monographs. By updating the current burdensome process, Congress would also create a pathway to market for new and innovative products that greatly benefit our constituents and reduce strain on our healthcare system. Safe, reliable, and affordable OTC drugs allow consumers to treat common ailments at home, usually without visiting a healthcare provider, saving the healthcare system $102 billion annually. Our bill would improve regulatory certainty for manufacturers and, over time, we would see additional investment in research and development, leading to new, innovative OTC medicines that will continue to save Americans and our healthcare system money. I thank my colleagues, FDA, and stakeholders for working so closely with me over the last 2 years to ensure that this modernization effort appropriately addresses and resolves this complex issue. I strongly urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 5333 to modernize the broken monograph system, strengthen consumer protection, spur innovation, and increase consumer choice. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5333, the OvertheCounter Monograph, Safety, Innovation and Reform Act. I am a proud original cosponsor of this legislation that will strengthen the Food and Drug Administration’s ability to oversee the overthecounter drug market and establish a user fee program for this market for the first time. H.R. 5333 is legislation that enjoys bipartisan support and would reform the current monograph system that is relied upon by industry to legally market overthecounter drugs in response to concerns raised by both the FDA and the industry that the current system is outdated and burdensome. Under current law, the safety and effectiveness of overthecounter drugs is established through conformance with a monograph. Monographs serve as a type of rule book outlining the conditions of use for a particular drug ingredient, including the dosage form, patient population, labeling and warnings, and other requirements. This rule book is established currently through a threephase rulemaking process and is very resource and time intensive. This process has made it difficult for the FDA to finalize, revise, or update monographs to reflect innovations, changes in science, or to respond to safety issues. We also have heard from the industry that the current process inadvertently discourages innovation, as it is not nimble enough to respond to evolving science and technology. The legislation we are considering today would address these concerns by transitioning the monograph system from rulemaking to administrative order, create a procedure for the FDA to respond to the needs for safety label changes, and establish an innovation pathway. 
These reforms can only be successful if it is also accompanied by stable and reliable funding that more appropriately represents the growth and science of the overthecounter industry. Today, the overthecounter monograph program oversees more than 100,000 products with a staff of about 30 people and a budget of just over $8 million. The user fees provided in this bill would help the FDA transition the monograph program from rulemaking to administrative order, provide for additional staff capacity, and enable the FDA to respond to innovation and safety changes in the current market. I want to thank my colleague from Ohio, Congressman BOBLATTA , for introducing this legislation and for working with me and other members of our committee. I would like to thank the original cosponsors of the bill, Representative DIANA DEGETTE , Representative DEBBIE DINGELL , Chairman M IKE BURGESS , and Representative B RETT  GUTHRIE for their dedication and hard work on this important issue. I ask all my colleagues to join me in supporting the OvertheCounter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ), the chairman of the Health Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of this important, bipartisan bill to modernize the regulation of overthecounter medicines. An overthecounter product is one that the Food and Drug Administration has found to be safe and effective for direct consumer use. To date, consumers have access to over 300,000 of these nonprescription items. We are all familiar with these products, from cough and cold medicines to antiperspirants, antacids, and sunscreens. Our pharmacy aisles and medicine cabinets are filled with overthe counter products that American consumers rely on each and every day. These products do not need premarket approval but are required to be consistent with monographs established by the Food and Drug Administration. Making a simple change to existing monographs requires a timeconsuming and resourceintensive rulemaking process that can, in fact, take years to effectuate even if the change is to enhance the safety of a product. This creates undue delay in potential benefits seen by consumers and is an inefficient use of public resources. b1815 Fortunately, the Food and Drug Administration, patient and consumer groups, and the regulated industry all agreed that reform is necessary and have spent the past several years engaged in discussions about modernization of the overthecounter regulation. Congress worked with these groups to turn these discussions into legislation that we are considering this afternoon. This bill would make the overthe counter regulatory framework more science based and responsive to public health concerns. It would encourage the development of more innovative products and would provide resources to the Food and Drug Administration to bolster the agency’s ability to review overthecounter applications and regulate this sector in a consistent manner. Quite simply, it is a meaningful bill for each American. I want to thank our Energy and Commerce Committee Members, Representatives LATTA from Ohio, D IANA DEGETTE from Colorado, B RETT GUTHRIEfrom Kentucky, D EBBIE DINGELL  from Michigan, as well as Ranking Member GREEN , my colleague from Texas, for their leadership in this legislation. I also want to recognize the hard work and the dedication of committee staff on this legislation, particularly Warren Burke and Michelle Vanek of the Office of Legislative Counsel; Danielle Steele, with our majority staff; and Kim Trzeciak, with the committee’s Democratic staff. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ). Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5333, the OvertheCounter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act of 2018, and I want to thank Chairman WALDEN and Ranking Member P ALLONE  for bringing this important bill to the floor. The monograph system for regulating overthecounter drugs is broken, plain and simple. Mr. Speaker, 60 percent of all medicines sold in the United States are over the counter, yet the FDA only has 18 fulltime employees overseeing the market. It doesn’t work for patients; it doesn’t work for companies; and it doesn’t work for the FDA. Companies cannot bring new, innovative products to market and the FDA cannot act quickly when they are faced with a safety risk. This is not reflective of how our healthcare system should be run, and it is putting patients at risk. Our legislation helps bring the agency into the 21st century by creating a user fee program at FDA for OTC drugs and by making it easier to bring a new, innovative product to the market. From past experience, we know that user fee programs have been very successful at FDA, and this bill extends that successful model to the OTC space. Today, the FDA has to go through the cumbersome rulemaking process to update a monograph, which is problematic for many different reasons. Not only does it make it harder for innovative products to come to market, but it also makes it nearly impossible for the FDA to amend existing monographs if they see safety concerns in certain products. We need to make sure FDA has the ability to act quickly if they see unsafe products in the market, and our legislation makes it easier for the agency to do so. This is why the bill has the support of industry groups and consumer groups. Mr. Speaker, I know that there has been much discussion about the exclusivity provisions of this legislation. It has been debated in committee, and we compromised with 18 months of exclusivity. I will be the first to admit it is not perfect, but, on balance, the public health benefits of this bill outweigh any concerns about exclusivity. Americans deserve to have the most innovative products on the market available to them, while ensuring the FDA has the resources they need to protect public health. I am proud to say that this legislation accomplishes both these goals. I, too, want to thank my colleagues, BOBLATTA , D IANA DEGETTE , B RETT  GUTHRIE , GENE GREEN , Dr. B URGESS , Chairman WALDEN , and Ranking Member PALLONE for all their hard work on this legislation. Their staffs worked tirelessly as well on this, and I want to thank all of them for their efforts. Passage of this bill represents another step towards getting our legislation signed into law this year. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5333. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), my friend and colleague. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for introducing this critical legislation. As it stands, the OTC monograph system is slow and outdated, leading to new changes being stuck in the pipeline for years with no light at the end of the tunnel. As a pharmacist, I know how important it is to my patients that they have access to new uses and applications. Regardless of the application needed under a monograph, today’s legislation puts in place changes that will help those who I have spent my life assisting: the patient. This legislation establishes a mechanism for safety label changes, giving these new efforts an outlet through which to get changes for the public quickly available and on shelves. This critical legislation will shorten market exclusivity by 6 months for certain new overthecounter products approved without a new drug application and will also bolster the staffing capability at the FDA overseeing the OTC drug industry. Overthecounter drug innovation has faced challenges for years, and, with 
this legislation, we finally have an opportunity to open up these channels that will help everyone. I voted for this legislation through the subcommittee and through full committee and am proud to offer my full support to pass this legislation. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ), my colleague and a member of our committee. Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, today we have an opportunity to make long overdue reforms to the way that the FDA reviews overthecounter medicines. These medicines play a critical role in treating Americans’ ailments and in helping us stay healthy. In fact, almost 7 in 10 parents report giving their kids OTC medicine to help treat sudden medical symptoms. Similarly, 81 percent of adults use these drugs as a first response to treat a minor ailment. Think about it. Despite the widespread use of overthecounter medicines, the FDA is currently forced to use a cumbersome and laborious monograph pathway to approve them. This antiquated, 40yearold OTC review system has not kept pace with new medical advances and the rapid expansion of this market, which now comprises over 300,000 drugs. As a result, the current monograph review system fails to respond to the OTC safety issues in a timely and effective way, which can pose serious healthcare risks for children and families. Between 2004 and 2005, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 1,500 cases of children under the age of 2 visiting emergency rooms due to serious side effects or overdoses associated with overthe counter cough and cold products. Since the CDC made this startling finding, the FDA has been trying to revise the cough and cold monograph system to warn parents about the risks that these common drugs can pose to children, but the FDA can’t do it because they have been hamstrung due to the burdensome process it must undergo to revise these monographs. The OvertheCounter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act would streamline the FDA’s review of overthecounter drugs and provide it with new tools to protect children and warn parents about potentially dangerous OTC drugs. I want to add my thanks to the bipartisan team that passed this bill, Representatives LATTA , BURGESS , GREEN , GUTHRIE , and D INGELL for all working together with me on this important legislation, and, in addition, Ranking Member PALLONE , Chairman W ALDEN , the FDA, and the many stakeholders that have worked closely with us throughout the process. Mr. Speaker, the bill is a rare triple win for regulators, consumers, and industry. I urge my colleagues’ support. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, once again, I just want to thank all the members for all their hard work on this. Especially, I want to thank the gentleman from Oregon, the chairman of the full committee, for his work on this piece of legislation. Also, I want to thank the staff. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5333, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. MULLIN ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this legislation to reauthorize the Animal Drug User Fee Act, ADUFA, which will continue agreements between the FDA and the animal drug industry to pay user fees that will help speed the approval of new drugs. Farmers, ranchers, families, and veterinarians need ADUFA so they can keep their animals and pets safe and healthy. In the rural and agricultural communities across the country, including my home State of Oklahoma, ADUFA is critical to farmers, ranchers, and all American consumers. These animals are a major food source for our communities and our families, so it is vitally important that we move quickly today and reauthorize ADUFA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5554, the Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2018. This bill reauthorizes the Food and Drug Administration’s animal drug and animal generic drug user fee programs and ensures that the FDA continues to have the tools it needs to approve animal drugs to help our pets and livestock live healthier lives. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the remainder of my statement. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5554, the Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2018. This bill reauthorizes the Food and Drug Administration’s Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Programs and ensures the FDA continues to have the tools it needs to approve animal drugs to help our pets and livestock live healthier lives. This legislation reauthorizes the FDA’s authority to collect user fees from the animal drug and generic animal drug industries for additional five years and reflects bipartisan agreement and recommendations negotiated between the FDA and the animal drug industry with input from farmers and ranchers, veterinarians, food and feed producers, and other public health stakeholders. These critical user fee agreements have helped to accelerate the development of animal drugs, reduce application review times at the FDA, and create a more predictable and streamlined process for getting animal drugs to market. It is critical that we pass H.R. 5554 today as the current authorization for these programs will expire on September 30th of this year. If ADUFA and AGDUFA are not reauthorized by the deadline, the FDA will lack the resources and subject matter experts it needs to do this important work. This will be the fourth reauthorization of ADUFA and the third reauthorization of AGDUFA. These user fee programs have proven to be highly successful and allow the Center for Veterinary Medicine at FDA to meet and exceed its performance goals. The FDA’s gold standard for safety and efficacy extends beyond products just for humans, but also for animal drugs. Safe and effective animal medications, as approved by FDA, protect our companion animals and keep our food supply safe. Reauthorizing ADUFA and AGDUFA ensures this continues. As a result of our bipartisan compromise, this bill also creates a conditional approval pathway for certain new animal drugs that are intended to treat a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition or address an unmet health need for which ongoing efficacy studies are complex or particularly difficult. I am 
pleased we have reached consensus on this policy and that the provision includes a 10 year sunset. The Energy and Commerce Committee has worked in a strong bipartisan fashion to move this bill forward. I commend my colleagues, Rep. KURT SCHRADER and Rep. M ARKWAYNE  MULLIN , for introducing this important legislation and advancing it for floor consideration. I urge my colleagues to join me and vote in support of the Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2018. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ), the chairman. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of this critical bill to reauthorize the Animal Drug User Fee Act and the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act for an additional 5 years. Among other things, these user fees provide critical resources to the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine to ensure efficient and timely review of animal drug applications, quality assurance measures for animal feed, and surveillance of the safety and efficacy of animal drugs on the market. In addition to reauthorizing these user fee programs, this legislation also includes new authority to facilitate greater innovation in the animal drug space. Mr. Speaker, these user fee programs must be reauthorized by September 30 to avoid a major disruption of the operations of the Center for Veterinary Medicine. The clock is ticking. The agency must start sending pink slips to employees 60 calendar days before the end of the fiscal year. That is the end of this month. We are talking about real consequences for animal health and for the American people. House passage of this bill today is an important step, and I urge the Senate to do its work and promptly take up and pass this bill so that President Trump can sign it into law. I thank the gentleman for the recognition. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER ), our colleague from the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5554 is a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the animal drug and animal generic drug user fee programs, and I am proud to lead it with my colleague, Mr. MULLIN . ADUFA and AGDUFA are crucial to FDA’s work to review and approve applications for animal drugs. Over the past several years, animal drug user fee programs have streamlined the approval process for pharmaceuticals and eliminated the FDA’s application backlog, reduced review times, and created a more predictable process. As a veterinarian from Oregon, I am particularly grateful to see this bill come to the floor. I am acutely aware of the great innovations that are occurring in the human health sphere, and I want to ensure our fourfooted friends also have access to the latest and greatest medical innovations. That is why I am particularly pleased with this bill and its language to expand conditional approval for animal drugs with major uses in major species. b1830 Conditional approval is a careful, deliberative process based on similar pathways for drugs for minor uses and minor species that was already established in 2004. Conditional approval is critical for veterinary medicine since it is not costeffective for drug companies to pursue large, complete clinical trials, given the small population of intended beneficiaries, without some initial interest and success under the conditional approval program. Before being conditionally approved, drugs must demonstrate a reasonable expectation of effectiveness and meet every other FDA standard for approval, including safety. They still need to get complete FDA approval within 5 years and must apply for annual renewal. I thank Chairman WALDEN ; Ranking Member PALLONE ; Mr. G REEN ; my colleague from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON), who worked very hard on the bill; and certainly Mr. MULLIN for his partnership in leading this way. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their bipartisan approach, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote from all my colleagues. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5554, the Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act of 2018. These user fee agreements are important to millions of North Carolinians living with companion animals. They are also important to the agricultural community. Some of you may not be aware that North Carolina is the second largest pork producer, the second largest turkey producer, and the third largest poultry producer in the country. Our agricultural community and family farms are essential to feeding our nation and they depend on medicines to keep animals healthy. I am pleased that the final legislation includes language that I have worked on with my colleagues including Representatives HUDSON and S CHRADER to enable conditional approval of innovative veterinary drugs that have been demonstrated to be safe to use and have a reasonable expectation of effectiveness. The FDA already has this authority for unmet medical needs in minor uses and minor species, and this expanded authority can help improve protections for animal and human health. This legislation must be passed before Congress adjourns for August or the FDA will be required to halt the programs. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. MULLIN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5554, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REPORT ON H.R. 6385, DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS BILL, 2019 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky, from the Committee on Appropriations, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–829) on the bill (H.R. 6385) making appropriations for the Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, which was referred to the Union Calendar and ordered to be printed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1, rule XXI, all points of order are reserved on the bill. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller handed down the most significant hacking indictment targeting a foreign power in history. Director Mueller alleges that 12 Russian military officers were responsible for breaking into political organizations, stealing sensitive documents, and disseminating them to undermine faith in American democracy. Friday’s indictment will further shape the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, and demonstrates our commitment to holding malicious actors accountable. Yet, today, Mr. Speaker, not 3 days later, President Trump said he didn’t see any reason to think that Russia carried out the election meddling. Well, the President set it up as whether you believe U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies or Russia. However, this isn’t a matter of belief, this is matter of fact; and the facts say the Russian government hacked us. I hope that the President will finally acknowledge this, and I pray that my Republican colleagues will hold him accountable if he doesn’t. And I thank Director Mueller for his ongoing work. 
NATIONAL JUVENILE ARTHRITIS AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, almost 820,000 Minnesotans live with arthritis every day. When you think about arthritis, you likely think of it affecting only folks in their older years. But many of those Minnesotans coping with arthritis are actually children. Nationwide, 300,000 children suffer from juvenile arthritis, which makes it harder to do all the things that are essential to being a kid: Running, playing, enjoying the outdoors, and a chance to be themselves. Families with children coping with this condition face very unique challenges. We have made a lot of progress, Mr. Speaker, in the fight against juvenile arthritis, but there is still a lot of work to be done. July is National Juvenile Arthritis Awareness Month, an opportunity to recognize, to refocus, and redouble our efforts to find a cure. 
b1915 RUSSIANS ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, now that the Manchurian President has come back from meeting with his holders in Helsinki, we need to look at what is going on here. We were scolded today in another country by the President of the United States telling us how: Well, Russia has made mistakes. Well, we have made mistakes, too. When has a President ever done that? And all my colleagues do is sit over there and don’t say a word. Let this have been some other President, it would be holy water in here. He attacks women all the time— NANCY PELOSI , MAXINE WATERS , ELIZABETH WARREN , Megyn Kelly, Hillary Clinton, you name it. But then stands there next to the person that had everything to do with our elections being rigged or held up, and he stands there and says: Well, he said he didn’t do it. What is going on here? Is there any backbone? The President of the United States doesn’t have a backbone. What did I see today? It used to be being called a communist was the worst thing you could call someone. Now they are our friends? Wake up. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BANKS of Indiana). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
TAX REFORM (Mr. NORMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the great news that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act continues to deliver for the people and small businesses of the Fifth District of South Carolina. It has been almost 7 months since tax reform, and our economy is booming. People have a renewed hope and sense of security in their futures again. Firsthand, I see small businesses in my district expanding and creating more jobs. New hires are at the highest level in 17 years. Smallbusiness optimism is the highest in decades. Consumer confidence is at its highest in 2 decades. I have directly heard from families who are seeing more hardearned dollars remaining in their pockets. Because of our progrowth policies, our economy, our families, and our businesses in my district and across the Nation will have strong futures. Thanks to tax reform, South Carolinians and Americans are better off now. HONORING THE LIFE OF DERRICK ‘‘BO’’ TAYLOR (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Derrick ‘‘Bo’’ Taylor, who attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1. Bo was devoted to his two sons, Gregory and Kyle, and his girlfriend, Denise Cohen. Bo worked for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for 29 years, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant. Bo and Denise dated for several years and attended the Route 91 festival together, where, tragically, they both died. Bo is remembered by his friends and family as being very well liked and respected, and a leader. He was dedicated to everyone in his life and was known as a true friend. I would like to extend my condolences to Bo Taylor’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF LYNDA DuRANT (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent in my district, Mrs. Lynda DuRant, who saved her husband’s life by bravely and correctly administering CPR in an emergency situation. An educator in the Effingham County public school system, Mrs. DuRant used her CPR training to save her husband John’s life when he suffered a significant cardiac event. The doctors said later that her immediate and proper use of CPR was crucial to his survival. CPR has only a 10.6 percent success rate, because it is often performed incorrectly. With early June being National CPR and AED Awareness Week, I encourage everyone to become certified in administering CPR. Like Mrs. DuRant, you never know when you will be called upon in an emergency to save a life. Thank you, Mrs. DuRant, for your brave action and for reminding us of the importance of this critical skill. 
ESSENCE OF BETRAYAL (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today President Trump went to a foreign country and criticized his own country, the United States of America, while bowing and scraping to a foreign dictator, Putin. Americans must ask this obvious question, and it is: Why does President Trump refuse to criticize Vladimir Putin about anything? It must be because Putin knows something about President Trump that President Trump doesn’t want the rest of us to know. If that is true, then President Trump has put his own well being and interests above those of the Nation. And that, Mr. Speaker, is the essence of betrayal. His actions have betrayed the confidence and the trust of the American people and could be called treasonous. Sadly, Trump’s supporters must look at themselves and think whether or not they were sold out by the dog whistle ‘‘Make America Great Again.’’ They must now realize that the President has subjected himself to domination by the leader of the international white nationalist movement, Vladimir Putin. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. f 
YUCCA MOUNTAIN (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the USA has approximately 121 sites around the country that are storing nuclear waste in approximately 39 States. They are in temporary facilities, temporary storage that could be subject to all sorts of problems, whether it be terrorist attack or other issues with nature. I had the chance recently to visit Yucca Mountain, the facility in Nevada that would be the repository for nuclear waste, if it could be approved and put in place. I was impressed with what I saw for many key issues. Seismic activity is very low in the area, if any. We have an issue where it could be a very hardened site for attack. It would be very difficult to attack it. And the issues with groundwater are nil, since groundwater is so deep in the Nevada desert, well below the areas proposed. We need to do something about this situation with nuclear waste being stored temporarily the way it is or with moving forward with a project like Yucca Mountain, which is the only one approved in the United States currently under the law. Mr. Speaker, further delay means further peril for the way this stuff is being stored currently. We need to move forward on this. 
TRUMPPUTIN MEETING (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn President Trump’s unpatriotic performance and feckless 
groveling to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin at today’s summit in Helsinki. President Trump, no, no, no. Putin’s Russia is not a competitor of the United States. His Russia is a fierce enemy of liberty in the United States and globally. Putin seeks every chance to undermine democratic institutions. He illegally invaded Ukraine and gunned down and poisoned freedom fighters like Boris Nemtsov. Our European allies are not our foes, Mr. President. They are our trusted friends. How can President Trump ignore the piercing sacrifice of bloodshed for liberty by thousands, hundreds of thousands of our countrymen and millions of our allies? As one of America’s rich sons, he chose to dodge the draft when his number came up, and I haven’t been able to find any veteran from his family. So I remind my colleagues of Patrick Henry’s admonition: Give me liberty or give me death. With our Constitution as our anchor, this legislative branch, Article I, must rise to meet its constitutional obligations to preserve liberty at all costs, placing country over party. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
IN RECOGNITION OF DAN CARSON (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dan Carson from Norwich, New York, who started an adaptive baseball program for individuals with physical and intellectual challenges. Seven years ago, Dan Carson started the Baseball Buddies game at the Norwich Little League field behind the middle school, and now it has grown into a huge community event. The program recently hosted its annual game, where about 25 past or present players from the Norwich Purple Tornados were paired with special needs students. For these kids, the game is about more than baseball. The players and buddies form lifelong friendships and learn valuable lessons from each other. Most students with special needs do not have the opportunity to participate in team sports in high school, but this game is an exception. Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Dan for all his work that he has done to create a place where, regardless of ability, children can participate in the great American pastime. I know I speak for everyone when I say, ‘‘Play ball.’’ 
TRADE POLICY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time tonight. It is my hope tonight that we will have a discussion in our country and in this historic Chamber on trade policy. I am delighted that two of my good colleagues have joined me to carry on this discussion. A key tenet of international economic policy for the Trump administration has been to improve U.S. bilateral and multilateral trade arrangements with an eye toward enforcing reciprocity with our trading partners as it relates to tariff levels and the elimination of nontariff barriers. The goal: to simply achieve more market access for American goods and services. Mr. Trump recognized this, campaigned on free and fair trade, and routinely emphasizes the importance of reciprocity between trading partners. He has stated that he prefers bilateral arrangements over multilateral arrangements by indicating that he did not want to pursue the Transpacific Partnership or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, one with Asia partners and one with the EU. While it is true that bilateral treaties are easier to negotiate and acquire, select multilateral arrangements can achieve broad geopolitical and geoeconomic strategic objectives. In the case of TPP, it could, potentially, significantly leverage the economic clout of China in Southeast Asia and obviously link longstanding free trade partners across the transatlantic region with the TTIP. President Trump has also initiated the effort to improve the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, among the United States, Mexico, and Canada. He has called this agreement one of the worst ever, but has offered concrete ways to improve it and modernize it for current conditions in Mexico, Canada, and the United States. No doubt, these are, in fact, significantly different than back in 1992 when the NAFTA agreement was arranged. This work continues in earnest, and I am pleased that the administration has made significant strides in improving NAFTA between Canada and Mexico over the past year, something that I think is very important in my home State of Arkansas, where Mexico and Canada are absolutely the largest trading partners that our companies and farmers have in my home State. President Trump’s objectives of changing the mercantilistic trade policies of China have proven more challenging. Tonight, we will talk about the President’s strategy, because we want the United States to have an opportunity in China. We want a more open China trading process. We want more goods and services made in America sold in China. But over the last 3 decades, China has developed into one of the world’s largest and fastest growing economies, but also one of the world’s largest protectionist economies, putting up barriers to American goods and services in both tariff matters and in nontariff ways. b1930 We are going to talk about that tonight, and I would like to start by talking about that with my friend from Ohio. What is interesting is that this strategy of getting at a more open China, ending a more mercantilistic trading policy with China has taken a couple courses of action: one, the President has imposed section 301 under the Trade Act of 1974, going after China’s intellectual property theft in the U.S., their ability to compel U.S. companies or companies from the European Union to give up their intellectual property in order to do business in China, clearly a violation. And so the President has proposed a 301 investigation and tariffs related to that. He has also imposed tariffs under the 1962 act for national security purposes across the board on steel and aluminum—all countries, all products. And that is very challenging, Mr. Speaker, because, if the real issue is getting at China, the world’s largest subsidizer and dumper of steel and aluminum, this may not be the most successful strategy to accomplish. That could, in fact, be a distraction from our ultimate objective in opening China. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ), my friend, so that we can have his perspective on tariffs and trade and how we can improve and be more successful in getting the outcomes that we want. Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, prior to coming to Congress 2 years ago, I spent 15 years building manufacturing companies. I have been personally on the receiving end of bad trade policy and bad trade practices. So, in 2016, when President—then candidate, now President—Trump talked about making America great again by dealing with bad trade deals and bad trade practices, frankly, he energized me and many other people in my industry, in the manufacturing sector, and, indeed, all across the country because America has lived with bad consequences of bad trade deals. In fact, America has built its history on trade. Truly, economic liberty is as much a part of America’s history as religious liberty and other forms of liberty. We were the world’s largest trading country. We are a great trading power in every way you can measure it. We do have trade deficits with some countries, but we have to pay attention to the right metrics. So when we talk about bad trade practices and bad trade policies, we talk about, to use an analogy, watching basketball. Think how the sport would change if there were no fouls called and no one could shoot free throws. These are the kinds of things that happened with the WTO. Eventually, after, sometimes, years of filing a 
complaint, the WTO will adjudicate a subsidy practice by China on steel, for example, and then they will say: Hey, you have to stop. Well, the moment a complaint is filed, the Chinese company just dumps faster because they know that it is going to be turned off. The trouble is there is no consequence for this bad conduct. So what I had hoped we would be doing is we would be using our great relationships around the world to unite our allies, our best trading partners, frankly, people who are also the victims of these bad trade practices and bad trade policies, to take action against those bad practices so that we can define what is a foul and what is the effective free throw. What are the consequences? I believe that the President’s goals are being poorly served by some of his advisers and I hope that the President will change course, because what we are doing has resulted in failure in every type of war studied, from Sun Tzu through World War II, through more modern wars. When you multiply your enemies, you are not winning, and we are doing that with the practices that some of the administration is implementing, things that implement uniform tariffs, things that distort the very definition of a national security issue to call German luxury autos a national security issue. We have tools in the kit bag that could be very effective, tools like sanctions. When we engage in warfare, when we engage with enemies of our country that are strategic enemies, we have sanctions in place against Russia, sanctions in place against Iran, and sanctions in place against North Korea. The beauty of sanctions is they can be targeted not just as a country or a sector; they can be targeted to companies and even individuals. We can use these things to restrict the flow, and we can define what is illicit finance. We can use these tools that the world uses already against bad actors and, frankly, some of the worst actors in the world to unite our allies and to define a better way for trade going forward. So we shouldn’t confuse this with a critique of the objective. The objective is, indeed, noble and necessary. Past trade practices, past Presidential policies have left America on the short end. True, as Milton Friedman said: 
If countries want to subsidize the cost of a good, let them. They are just lowering the cost for our consumers. 
But we can’t simply be a nation of consumers. We need people to put capital at risk in America to thrive, and for our great industries, whether it is agriculture or manufacturing or technology, for the intellectual property to flourish here. We have the best markets for goods, services, intellectual property, capital, and we need to make sure that we defend that. I applaud President Trump for being passionate about putting America first in these practices, but I do believe that we need to look at the tactics that have been employed by many who have advised him and say, ‘‘Is this multiplying our enemies?’’ And, in fact, it is. I hope we can move forward in a better way and we can serve this great country by restoring trade to its right and proper place as a vibrant part of our economy. Exports drive our economy, but imports can benefit our economy. Trade is exactly that. Trade is something of value for both parties. Both profit when trade is there. A zerosum understanding is not the right way to look at trade. We benefit and so do others; and it is okay that they benefit, because then they are able to buy more from us in trade. The practices that are in place today give us a chance to assess the progress, and I think it is vital that we do that. It is vital that we keep this economy doing the great things that it has under President Trump’s leadership, under congressional leadership. We were told that the new normal was a 1.5 percent growth rate, that we couldn’t grow at the high rate. With regulatory relief and tax reform, our economy is growing higher than 3 percent, and we certainly don’t want to do anything that would derail that momentum. I am encouraged by Mr. HILL’s dialogue tonight, and I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak. I know we have other colleagues who would like to as well. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Ohio. He is a valued member of the House Financial Services Committee, and his decades of work in private business and in manufacturing is ideal for this discussion. He knows about intermediate goods manufacturing and how a lot of those parts are made domestically, but some parts, critical parts, might be made abroad. Nonetheless, they allow us to create a competitive manufactured good here in the United States, employ Americans, and then potentially sell that domestically or export it to, yet again, another country. I appreciate his manufacturing expertise. We are also joined tonight by my friend from Illinois, a distinguished member of the House Ways and Means Committee, DARIN LAHOOD, who comes from America’s heartland of agriculture and can speak to the issue of how do we achieve this outcome that we want: more open markets, fairer and reciprocal trade, but how do we do that in a way that minimizes the impact on American consumers and our agricultural producers. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD), my friend. Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, FRENCH HILL, for organizing tonight’s Special Order on trade. I want to associate my thoughts tonight with the comments made by Congressman DAVIDSON and also with Congressman FRENCH HILL. Mr. Speaker, I would just start off and say that it is imperative that we, as Members of Congress, come together to stress to the President and his administration the importance of free trade. When I look back over the last year and a half of his administration, I applaud the President and his leadership in working with us to roll back regulation, have reasonable regulation in place, and also onceinalifetime tax reform that he was able to get passed, along with this Congress, two accomplishments that have jumpstarted our stagnant economy, and we are seeing the results. However, I think we do ourselves a real disservice to the work that we have already done on this economy by engaging in a trade war. I think we go backwards in terms of the economic progress that we are making to get in a longterm trade war. Mr. DAVIDSON referenced it a little, but it is frustrating and disappointing to see several staff members with the President who are unelected and unconfirmed who are trade protectionists. They have the ear of the President when it comes to implementing trade policy, and that is, again, frustrating. These protectionists are failing to take the time and recognize the longterm costs of the recent tariff actions and our current position as it comes to renegotiating NAFTA and other trade agreements on our economy. I have said this many times before when I think back to the election. Our President wasn’t elected by people on the East Coast or the West Coast. It was people in the Midwest, people from rural America, people from the South who helped elect him. And, unfortunately, these are the folks who are left the worst off by these trade policies that are being put in place currently by the administration. As we move forward in this Congress, we need to carefully examine how much authority the legislative branch has ceded over time to the executive branch. I credit my colleague, WARREN  DAVIDSON , for introducing a piece of legislation that I am a cosponsor of that would help take back a little of that authority under our Constitution, to have more input from Congress on that. We need to talk more about that, managing our trade policies to determine how best to restore our constitutional authority. Our other colleague, Congressman GALLAGHER of Wisconsin, has also introduced a piece of legislation that also does the same thing. We have no choice or alternative with the current world that we live in. We live in a globalized world with supply chains set and marketplaces and customers continuing to grow, but we need to be engaged. Given that 95 percent of the world’s customers live outside of the United States, we tend to forget that we represent about 4.5 percent of the world’s population. There is no doubt that we produce the best goods; we produce the best products; we have the best workers. But you have got to have markets. You 
have got to have customers around the world for those products to go to support free and fair trade. I think about Illinois. Illinois is the sixth largest State in the country. Ag is the number one industry in the State of Illinois. It is the number one in my district. When I think about Illinois, for example, global trade supports over 1,700,000 jobs in Illinois. Ensuring that our manufacturers and farmers have access to markets around the world to sell their goods is vital to their ability to remain competitive and our economic success. The district that I represent, Illinois’ 18th Congressional District, spans central and west central Illinois. We are proud to be home to some of the world’s most respected manufacturers, including companies like John Deere, Caterpillar, and CNH. We are also home to some of the world’s most fertile farmland. We have the eighth largest district in the country in terms of corn and soybean production in the country. About 40 percent of the corn and soybeans grown in my district go somewhere else around the world. They get put on barges on the Illinois and Mississippi River, go down that river through New Orleans, through the Gulf, through the new Panama Canal, and go anywhere around the world. But when you put up tariffs and barriers, you restrict those farmers from getting their goods all across the world. Unfortunately, these days, manufacturing and agriculture communities like mine across the country face uncertainty and dark days ahead. That is because of our current trade policy. While I applaud the President’s intent to go after bad actors in the global marketplace, his approach and the resulting retaliation has put our American workers and products in jeopardy, with no end in sight. The administration’s reckless and frequent use of tariffs, some premised on national security, which I think is a fallacy, threaten to spark an allout trade war in this country and around the world. We have already seen retaliation on Americanmade products from some of our closest allies like Canada, Mexico, and the EU. In addition, China, which consumes a third of the world’s soybeans, has also followed suit. In Illinois, total State exports threatened by new tariffs have reached over $3.8 million. Instead of tariffs, which are simply taxes passed on to consumers, our approach to address unfair trading practices should be targeted to minimize collateral damage and should include specific and clear end goals, which we have not seen. Bottom line, we must pursue targeted trade enforcement policies that minimize harm to American farmers, our rural communities, and our manufacturers. b1945 We know that our agriculture industry is typically first and hardest hit by any trade retaliation. To make things worse, our farmers are already at a disadvantage compared to other foreign competitors given the lack of free trade agreements that the U.S. has compared to other countries, especially in the Asian markets. It was referenced earlier that TPP which, of course, is the TransPacific Partnership, is going on without us. I look back at this administration. There was a lot of talk when they came in about bilateral trade agreements. We are 19 months into this administration, and we don’t have one—not one— bilateral trade agreement. There was a lot of talk about putting those in place. Part of the reason we have not had that is they have run from us because of our position and what we have asked for in those bilateral trade agreements. The loss of marketplace due to tariffs will be extremely hard to regain and may not be possible to regain at all. The administration’s go at it alone approach is clearly not as effective as with working with our allies to negotiate a solution to global oversupply and technology theft perpetrated by countries like China, and there is no doubt they have done that. The forced technology transfers and the stealing of our technology should be addressed. But there are better ways to do that in a strategic and a precise way, partnering with our allies to do that, but we can’t do that going at it alone, and we can’t do it premised on national security. Lastly, let me just say that we have heard a lot about surpluses. We have heard a lot about trade deficits. It seems like the administration is fixated on trade deficits. I will tell you, in agriculture we have a trade surplus with every country in the world. Think about the collateral damage that is going to be done to those farmers and those ag products by engaging in a trade war. We do need to address the trade deficit, but it is a complicated, nuanced issue that we ought to address. There are lots of things we can do to change that instead of the path we are heading down right now. At the end of the day, our farmers want trade, not aid. In a free market system, it shouldn’t be based on subsidies or aid. So we need to, again, continue to work with this administration on our proper oversight, taking back some of our constitutional authority to make sure that we are getting the message across that we need to have free and open trade that is going to benefit our farmers, our manufacturers, and working people all across this country. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. LAHOOD from Illinois, for his expertise in agriculture and these markets. I think it is very important to have his example. I might react by saying the gentleman was talking about the power of working together. I was reflecting that if we were working together to leverage the challenges of China, we are about 15 percent of twoway trade with China. The European Union is about 15 percent or so of trade with China. Japan is another seven. Clearly working together on some of these issues that we have in common would give us more leverage. Let me just outline four key objectives I think of U.S. trade policy with China that I believe would be shared by those two other groups that I mentioned, the European Union and Japan. Ensure China fully complies with its obligations as a member of the WTO, including the beneficial agreements on government procurement, information technology, environmental goods agreement, and a trade and services agreement. These are things, Mr. Speaker, that we have worked on bilaterally and multilaterally since China entered the WTO in 2001, an admission I think now that many people question, was China really ready to join the World Trade Organization in 2001? That is number one. Number two, that we fully protect U.S. intellectual property rights and establish ways and means to cease governmentdirected cyber theft of U.S. trade secrets and intellectual property both for commercial and national security reasons. I am reminded that Ambassador Winston Lord, the U.S. Ambassador to Beijing in 1989, when he was briefing President Bush 41 in preparation of his first foreign trip. President Bush’s first foreign trip in February of 1989 was to China where he had served as our representative back in the 1970s. Ambassador Lord wrote that memo to the President and said: You have got to talk about religious freedom, human rights. You have got to talk about Taiwan. You have got to talk about Tibet. And you have got to talk about theft of intellectual property. This was in February, 1989, Mr. Speaker, and we are still debating that issue today, unresolved. I would say that the European Union shares that view. Now, here is the amusing point. Ambassador Lord and the State Department team, when they sent that memo to President Bush 41, said that it was in its eighth printing, and they were sorry that the author wasn’t getting any royalties for it. Meaning, we have been talking about this since we established diplomatic relations with China back in 1979, and we have been fighting this intellectual property theft. Number three, seek changes in China’s extensive industrial policies which protect domestic sectors and firms, particularly China’s stateowned industries. China’s objective is for these stateowned enterprises to be global competitors compatible with other trading partners, but they are not. They are stateowned. They are state subsidized. Finally, fourth, promote changes to industrial policies that provide open 
and reciprocal treatment for American exporters of goods and services by reducing nontariff barriers and making China’s tariff level comparable with U.S. tariffs. I think those four things, Mr. Speaker, is what all of us agree on tonight, and I think they would benefit the European Union as well. But I think my friends have made a good case that if we were to partner with the E.U. and with Japan, we would have a lot more economic clout in delivering on that negotiating posture. I would ask my friend from Ohio, does he share that view? What are his thoughts about what are alternative strategies maybe in the steel and aluminum area? Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ). Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. HILL. I want to agree with the importance of bringing allies to the table to address those practices. There are four, and there are several others that we would probably agree on. In a way, I think the thing that our President respects about China is they put China first. They have used all the resources of their nation really since 1989, since Deng Xiaoping transformed China’s economy to a more marketoriented economy. They are not a marketoriented economy. That was one of the things they committed to do as part of joining the World Trade Organization. They are a commanddriven economy in many respects. They have made great progress since 1989 to being market oriented. Frankly, since 2008, they have gone the other way in some of their practices. If you look at the revolutionary idea, though, the idea that lives can be changed by trade and capitalism, China under Deng Xiaoping, at the peak, they were using communism with Communist principles, and he introduced to them communism with Chinese principles, which was essentially capitalism as long as we can stay in charge. It is a corrupt, subsidized form of capitalism, but at its peak, it was lifting 1 million Chinese people a month out of dollaraday poverty. Trade was a key part of this, inflows of foreign direct investment to reach this massive market. Today General Motors sells more cars in China than they sell in the United States of America. This is a better path than the one I expected. When I graduated from high school in 1988, Mr. Gorbachev had not torn down the Berlin Wall. By the end of 1989 when I was there, unfortunately bad things had happened in Tiananmen Square in China, but, thankfully, great things happened at the Berlin Wall. I was fortunate to be able to see people there. I met a man who was from East Germany in his first hours of freedom who said: Is it like this everywhere? We were in the Ku’damm district— kind of like Times Square is in New York—in Berlin. I thought he meant how big the city was. But what he really meant was the stores were open at night, and there is fresh milk, as he said. He was astonished that regular people, even foreigners, could go in, and the shelves had stock. This is the idea of economic liberty. This has produced abundance wherever it has been tried. Where the other ideas, the redistribution that Mao tried every version of Marxist Communist ideology that he could think of, and they all failed. They produced scarcity, poverty, and depravity. By engaging in the world, China transformed their economy. That is something to respect. I think the President admires the way that they put China first. But the reality is in putting China first, they have engaged all the resources of the country to where in 2014 we saw that President Obama had to take action against hackers. In fact, they were indicted. But did President Obama cut off all relations and trade with China? He did not. He engaged in diplomacy with China. I think it is great that we engage with Russia. Perhaps even Russia will see a marketoriented economy. They started out that way in the 1990s. But they also proved that deficits do matter. This is something that the whole West wrestles with, and it is another thing that we could unite in agreeing with. I hope we can also get to ways we can unite here, because, as Mr. LAHOOD mentioned, the Global Trade Accountability Act is not an adversarial bill. It doesn’t even go retroactive to the actions that have occurred in the past. It does get Congress engaged. It gets Congress engaged because the same benefits of cooperation, the same benefits of multiplying our allies instead of multiplying our enemies, could happen here in Congress where we multiply the people working on the problem. We want to join our President in taking action against bad actors and in making our trade policy better than it has been even with the Canadians— they have bad trade practices that we can improve. Even with the Europeans; they have bad trade practices that we can improve upon. Great friends work through problems and I feel like that is the reality that we have with our friends. Here in Congress, the President has great friends. I would consider the three of us some of his great friends, not adversaries, in the goal we are concerned, I think, about the means of getting to that, and the Global Trade Accountability Act would simply say that Congress works with the President who leads the negotiations similar to the REINS Act. Where Congress can come alongside and say we do it, what would that mean? Well, that would mean that the President is more engaged. But it’s really the President’s advisors. Men like Peter Navarro, instead of refusing to come talk to Ways and Means, would engage with our chairman, would engage with our committee dealing with trade, and would, in fact, develop a plan instead of criticize their own failure to plan after the fact. How do we know this? This is an example. We have a uniform tariff policy that probably never should have been implemented, that has got a chance for exclusions. We have over 20,000 companies that want exclusions right now. Commerce is doing them not sector by sector, but company by company; not commodity by commodity, but company by company. There are only six people working on this massive task. Were there to be required engagement, I believe there would have been a better plan in that collaborative approach, and perhaps a different course of action. I look forward to seeing other ways that you all might think that we could collaborate and make the great cause of making our trade agreements better and more productive. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Ohio. It is quite clear that in Article I the Congress exclusively in an enumerated power has the power of regulating commerce between foreign nations and, of course, we know setting duties, levies, and taxes as an Article I power. I think you make an important component, just like Congress partnered with the executive branch on how to rightsize certain overregulation in our economy from the previous administration or how Congress collaborated with the Treasury Department in designing tax reforms to make America more competitive to have people bring business back to the U.S., not be double taxed on foreign earnings. In both of those examples, as you note, we collaborated, the executive branch and the legislative branch. So I do think that also would strengthen the sequencing of our strategy to get at the heart of what I think our key challenges are which revolve around access into China. I ask my friend, Mr. LAHOOD, does he have thoughts on this line of discussion? Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. HILL. The gentleman laid out four different objectives which I think are very pertinent. The gentleman mentioned state owned enterprises. I think about that in China, and I think about how in many ways they have cheated the system and done things, but this is a problem that has been going on for a long time. One of the requirements with any trade agreement is you have to have enforcement. I don’t think we have had proper enforcement like we need when it comes to a number of these initiatives we have had over a series of 20, 25 years. But enforcement is important. That means law enforcement. It means getting the Department of Justice involved holding bad actors accountable. But I think you have more 
ability to do that and more leverage if you partner with the E.U., you partner with Japan, you partner with our other allies to do that. We simply haven’t done that. I think, again, going at it alone is not the right approach to take. Are there things we ought to be working on to change? Of course. There are rules we should change. We should engage on a number of these issues. We should hold a number of the bad actors accountable. But disengaging, putting up tariffs, and putting up barriers are the frustrating parts to me because I have not seen what is the ultimate goal with this strategy. What is the endgame? How do we land this plane eventually? That is what is frustrating to me. What I try to explain to my farmers and my manufacturers in the district is: How does this all end? I have worked with the White House on a number of issues and been a strong ally with them, but there is clearly a division in the White House. You have the protectionist wing and you have the freetrader wing. b2000 There are many good people who have talked about the importance of free trade—Secretary Perdue, Ambassador Branstad to China, Secretary Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow—people who support the free enterprise system, support trade. Gary Cohn was in that group. On the other side, you have the more protectionist wing. Again, from them, we have not seen how this all ends, giving us some confidence this is going to work out. That is the frustrating part, again, for our constituency and my farmers and manufacturers moving forward. We have talked a lot about China and what they have engaged in and what they have done, whether, again, it is forced technology transfers. In a lot of ways, what they do with American companies that come over there or foreign companies is a form of extortion: Give us your technology, make us a part of it, and then we will let you come into the country. Well, we ought to be stronger in going after them. There are mechanisms and ways, and there are success stories in doing that. But we pulled out of TPP, and that is something the President ran on. But what has happened since we pulled out of TPP? All those other countries have gravitated towards China, Southeast Asia. They have gravitated towards them without us. So we are left out, being on our own. I don’t think that is good, long term, when we need marketplaces and we need customers to engage with. Being isolated is not the right approach to take on this. We need to, again, engage the White House and particularly try to understand the path we are on and the end game here moving forward. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Illinois mentioned enforcement. I was looking in the archives this week when I was thinking about China, and I found an article that I wrote back in 1996 as a private citizen about the Clinton administration’s China policy. The paragraph on China and trade reads like this: 
China, as a world power, for her part, must recognize that bilateral and multilateral treaties are to be enforced. Lack of compliance with international treaty obligations must produce a known and delivered set of sanctions by the world community. China must clearly understand the consequences of noncompliance. 
I would argue so strongly about the gentleman’s point that have we—when I say ‘‘we,’’ I mean the United States, in the past two decades, the European Union as an entity and others—have we done a good job at enforcing those norms and those treaty provisions and those basic tenets of being a WTO member aggressively and collectively against China? I would argue we have a mixed record at best. But I think the gentleman makes a very good point about enforcement. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ). Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I think we have made great progress towards that end in uniting on trying to take a difference course of action. Just recently, we passed updated export controls and CFIUS regulation to try to give more tools to the kit bag. Who is going to execute this? The executive branch. But the legislative branch passed the law, the House, the Senate. We are working to get the final package to agree on language—not just against China, but anybody who would steal our intellectual property, anybody who would take targeted action to harm our economy or put their citizens in a position to do that harm—and also try to strike the balance. Here is the thing. We can have perfect security for America’s intellectual property by exporting zero of it, but we can’t do that. What we have to do is find a balance that says: We want you to innovate in the United States of America; we want the ideas to continue to originate here; we want the capital to be invested here to create those great ideas; but we do want to have some concern. You mentioned the Clinton administration. One of the first actions Bill Clinton took as President was to move release authority for sensitive information from the Department of Defense into the Department of Commerce. And what happened? Swiftly, Hughes worked with China to be able to help send them launch vehicles off of one rocket. One rocket went up into the air, multiple low Earth orbit satellites went around, precisely positioned in orbit around the Earth. The down side is that is the exact same technology that can be used to send warheads to multiple cities after one launch vehicle penetrates U.S. airspace. This is dangerous technology in the wrong hands. So we have to find a way to review those things and keep America safe, but we also have to find a way to have the ideas and the intellectual property initiate here. We can’t shut down all these in the name of national security. We certainly don’t want to shut down the production of luxury automobiles. But we might want to restrict the trade there. China is actually targeting our entrepreneurs. We have some of the best education in the world, and the world comes here to become welleducated. Over 50 percent of our graduate and postgraduate students are not native born Americans. We allow, frankly, most of the world to come here to get educated. Unfortunately, we don’t retain enough of that talent. So we send many of those people out of here with those skills that can be put to work in our marketplace. But in the process, Chinese capital sometimes and, frankly, other foreign nationals are getting into venture capital. They are on our campuses. They are recruiting our talented people. They also are looking to buy our innovative ideas for dual use, but sometimes only to advance their own technology. The challenge today is that China has had this mixed blend of aggressive behavior towards us. They have also seen the benefits of trade. They have seen the benefits of the flow of goods, services, capital, and, in some cases, people, and they have brought those to bear to benefit their own economy. Today, nearly a third of initial public offerings are taking place in China. This is a challenge. And I would say we are better off finding a way to compete in the marketplace than as I thought I would as a soldier, which I never thought I would go to China without body armor and a rucksack full of ammo and night vision goggles and whatnot. I would rather trade with them. I hope we can stay on friendly terms with them. I hope we can get on friendly terms with Russia, when it is possible. As much as it depends on us, we should live at peace with everyone. But we do have to trade. We do have to enforce the rules. We do need law and order. We have made many of these commitments, including commitments in the WTO. We should insist that China live up to their obligation and become a marketoriented economy. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about the steel and aluminum tariffs across the board. I have raised that issue before I was joined by many Members of the Congress on that issue because I felt like it came out of the blue to Members of Congress engaged in trade policy, whether on the House Financial Services Committee or on the House Ways and Means Committee, and that it was sweeping in its nature. 
It has produced the challenge you talked about that 20,000 American businesses are trying to seek an exclusion from that. I have several in my district, Mr. Speaker, who make the steel belts and steelbelted radial tires who are hurting. These are companies in Arkansas that use a steel rod that is not made in America, Mr. Speaker, and that is spun into the steel belt that is sold to the tire manufacturing industry. They are being hurt by this kind of acrossthe board steel and aluminum tariff. If we are concerned about a good, healthy aluminum industry for national security purposes and a good, healthy steel industry for national security purposes, then we ought to go after, directly, the world’s largest dumper of steel and aluminum, which is China and their stateowned enterprise sector with their subsidies, and not sweep up everyone engaged in that intermediate goods manufacturing in America, not penalize our partners in Europe who share that concern with us, who could help us go after that. Ambassador Lighthizer made a comment. He said: Well, one of the key reasons for going across the board like that was the risk of transshipment risk, in other words, violating the rules of origin, passing Chinese subsidized or dumped steel through a third country into the U.S., like Mexico, for example, or Canada, for example, just to name two possibilities. That got me thinking: Well, surely— back on my friend from Illinois’ comment about enforcement—there is a more elegant way to tackle what is really a regulatory issue, a transshipment risk, rule of origin risk. Why don’t we see what others are doing? So I looked at Canada. Just in March of this year, Mr. Speaker, the Canadians put in place a whole new regulatory regime working with the Americans to block rules of origin changes or transshipments of Chinese steel or aluminum through Canada. And, likewise, we have worked with the EU; and the OECD has their own steel committee that works to, on a regular basis, block that kind of work. So I just wonder, if we had consulted and worked together, perhaps we could have taken a more sophisticated route at stopping steel and aluminum dumping that is damaging our American industry. We do need a protective steel and aluminum industry in this country, no doubt. We also have good friends like Canada, good allies who produce it, but that is not to say that we don’t want to have a vibrant industry here. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD). Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, on the national security issue and premising much of this on national security, I didn’t serve in the military, but national security is not something that should be used lightly. So when I saw that being used by this administration, I went to the experts and talked to people in our military. I think we saw early on that General Mattis was interviewed. He didn’t think very highly that this was a national security risk. Talk to any of our top brass in the military and I don’t think you will find anybody that supports this. I don’t think you have seen anybody in the administration from the military that has come out to support this as a national security threat, because it is not, in my view. I think it is a faulty premise to go forth on this. I think, eventually, when it gets to the WTO, I don’t think it is going to stand up. I think that, again, gets back to our credibility in going about this. We have got to be very careful when we put our prestige of the United States out there and rely on national security when you can’t even find our own defense apparatus and our security folks out there who think this is a proper basis to do this. So that concerns me, moving forward, and I think, again, puts us in a tough position, again, being more isolated and not having other likeminded allies to help us. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ). Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, prior to being here, I worked in the manufacturing sector. I worked in metal stamping. One of the challenges, as Mr. HILL highlighted, is the tariffs are only on the commodity. Frankly, they are blunt force. They are all steel, all aluminum. The reality is some grades of steel, some grades of aluminum are commodity. Beverage cans, for example, are a commodity. We make it in the U.S.; they make it in Canada. Everywhere they consume lots of beverages, there is a significant ability to produce this grade of aluminum. So the idea that we would target that isn’t necessarily changing our market, but where it is, there are things like the grades of rod that your tire manufacturers are or a similar rod for welding wire. Welding wire is highly automated. So we have got domestic welding wire manufacturers who already weren’t the lowest cost provider. China, India, South Korea all heavily subsidize their welding wire manufacturers. Having domestic welding wire manufacturers probably is a national security issue. We want the base rod to be made in the U.S. Some of those grades aren’t. But soon, if we don’t get exclusions to our domestic welding wire manufacturers, we won’t have the manufacturer of welding wire either. Meanwhile, their cost for the steel has gone up by 25 percent or more because of the tariffs and they are losing market share. They don’t have a year or 2 to wait for the exclusions review. They are losing business now. And the size they are could kill their companies. Some of these companies are big enough to just shift production offshore, as we have seen other people do, but some of the smaller companies don’t have that option. They will live or die on whether or not they can get a governmentmandated exclusion to a governmentcreated problem that restricts their ability to buy the aluminum. So we either have to put tariffs on the secondary goods—so you can see where this goes—and then they will put tariffs on the secondary goods, or we have to find a way where we say it is a national security issue for us to get this capability in the U.S. We want that capability, but we have to go about it the other way. I believe passionately that it is the sanctions. As you alluded to your own articles in the sixties, you have to take sanctions action. When you talk about how you deal with transshipments, we already deal with transshipments for national security purposes. And it is targeted. The sanctions protocol offers a path forward. I hope we can engage on that. I hope we can pass the Global Trade Accountability Act to provide a check, and I hope that more of our colleagues will engage in this sort of discussion. I hope colleagues across the aisle can engage in it, not necessarily to be an attack on our President or our policies, but as a gateway to support economic liberty that has indeed made America the land of opportunity. b2015 Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time of my colleagues tonight on the floor. We have worked hard tonight to talk about how do we have a more constructive partnership between the executive branch and the legislative branch like we do in designing economic policy, tax policy, regulatory reform policy, like this excellent description that Mr. DAVIDSON gave of how we created a modernized CFIUS approach for reviewing investments into the United States. We had full engagement with General Mattis at the Pentagon, Secretary Mnuchin at the Treasury Department, Secretary Ross at the Commerce Department, and the White House, with Senator CORNYN in the United States Senate, ANDYBARR, ROBERT PITTENGER  here in the House working to create a collaborative approach regarding how to have a great national security policy for investment in the U.S. I think we have all argued here tonight that, with our Article I engagement in the House Financial Services Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee, we want to be a constructive partner on accomplishing the President’s objective, which is fair and reciprocal trade, first and foremost, with China, and to finally break this cycle we have talked about tonight of inadequacy, of holding them to account, making progress, enforcing their rules of the road under WTO, all with a heart toward helping our consumers, having more choice, more free 
trade, more opportunity to expand our economy, not contract, as we get into a downward spiral on a tariffonly strategy. Mr. Speaker, we want to work successfully with this administration on a new and modern NAFTA and with a successful set of trading arrangements with our friends in Europe and in Asia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
HIGH STAKES ON THE HIGH COURT: JUSTICE HANGING IN THE BALANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ESTES of Kansas). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. CLARKE ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to anchor this CBC Special Order hour. I would like to thank our Congressional Black Caucus chairman, Representative CEDRIC RICHMOND of Louisiana, for his leadership in this effort. For the next hour, we have an opportunity to speak directly to the American people about issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus and the 78 million constituents we represent. Tonight’s Special Order hour theme is High Stakes on the High Court: Justice Hanging in the Balance. As onefourth of the Democratic Caucus, we are emphatic in our opposition of Donald Trump’s USA Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. During the 2016 election, a thencandidate Trump, in his sole attempt to appeal to African American voters, asked: ‘‘What do you have to lose?’’ Well, it turns out, my fellow Americans, we have so much to lose. In fact, we have lost already under Donald Trump. Every time Donald Trump and the congressional Republicans undermine and sabotage healthcare, Black and Brown folks lose. When congressional Republicans and Donald Trump give their billionaire donors and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans such a massive tax cut and then raise taxes on low and middle class families, working class families, Black and Brown folks, lose. When Donald Trump threatened temporary protected status, TPS, Black and Brown folks lost. And with the recent announcement of Brett Kavanaugh as the President’s nominee, Black and Brown folks now have even more to lose. The stakes have never been higher. For nearly eight decades, African Americans have arduously, through generations of sacrifice and protest, successfully fought to secure historic legal victories that have significantly bent the moral arc of the universe towards justice. Republicans want to destroy a generation of progress for civil rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, workers’ rights, and healthcare. Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination solidifies the Republican agenda to roll back major social legislative victories that would impede our advancements in social justice. With the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, we are looking at the most conservative Supreme Court in over 75 years. Everything we hold dear as American ideals—our freedom, our tolerance, our values and progress in improving the human condition in our Nation—are at risk. We know Brett Kavanaugh has a record of ruling against affordable healthcare and women’s rights, but what is even more troubling is how his record on racial issues have flown under the radar. We cannot consider a Supreme Court Justice without analyzing their views on such issues as voting and workforce rights that will have an overwhelming effect on the life and liberty of all people of color. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, E LEANOR HOLMES NORTON , the chairwoman of the judicial task force of the Congressional Black Caucus, whom it is now my honor and privilege to present and who has an extraordinary record of legal acumen and has been an outspoken advocate for criminal justice reform, social justice, and has been scrutinizing judicial nominations so that we can provide for the American people an analysis of what we have to lose. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York, and I particularly thank her for her very cogent remarks and wish to associate myself with those remarks in every sense of the word; and I say so to the good lady from the State of New York as the leader of the CBC task force on Federal court nominations, including the Supreme Court nomination, where I have had the opportunity to look deeply at the decisions of this nominee now serving on the court of appeals, as it turns out, for the District of Columbia, Brett Kavanaugh. I think the gentlewoman’s remarks are telling in their understanding of the extreme damage he would do—and I must add not only to African Americans, but to the rule of law as we have known it. I rise to indicate that the Congressional Black Caucus stands in strong opposition to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and we will be doing all we can to keep that nomination from proceeding to the floor of the Senate. We do have two members of the Congressional Black Caucus on the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, and we are working closely with them as well. We in the Congressional Black Caucus are not the only Members of Congress opposed to this nomination, but we represent those Americans who have been disproportionately dependent on a fair Supreme Court. African Americans have always been a minority group in our country. For that reason, from slavery on to the days of discrimination in the 19th and 20th centuries, the African American community has been particularly dependent on the courts of the United States to protect them from unequal treatment by the majority. We have had every reason to know that, if we are in the hands of the partisan majority, given 400 years of history, we have no protection. African Americans are disproportionately dependent on an objective Supreme Court. Now, that doesn’t mean a Supreme Court of our choosing, but a Supreme Court that is open to all points of view and capable of seeing beyond partisanship. Brett Kavanaugh is not that nominee. We know so because he has perhaps the longest record of opinions of names submitted to Republicans for review. The D.C. circuit, which is the federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which happens to be my district, has been a circuit where Kavanaugh has been very mindful of the Supreme Court. I say that because he has so often written in dissent from his own colleagues on a Republican Court that it has been as if he were trying to write his way onto the Supreme Court. Remember Kavanaugh’s background. He started his career as a political operative in the Bush administration, and he has brought that extreme partnership, as a political operative, straight into the D.C. circuit. We are not asking the Senate for a nominee of the kind we would have chosen. That is not our demand. But because this is the most partisan Congress since the Civil War, I believe we are within our rights in asking for a Court that would be a stabilizing influence so the American people could see that not all is lost because there is an objective actor on the scene, and that actor is the Supreme Court of the United States. It is that Court which has protected us, we who are African Americans, from unequal treatment ever since Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. That does not mean that African Americans have always won at the Supreme Court level, but they have always had reason to believe that there was a court of last resort that would be open to them. We no longer would have that sense of openness to their views if Brett Kavanaugh becomes the nominee put 
forward in this session. We have seen no evidence that he would adhere to equal protection of the laws. I will cite some examples that illustrate where his views in his cases lead that he would not protect the longheld holding of the courts that no American can be arrested without probable cause, that he would not protect even the separation of powers, and that he would not uphold the rights of Americans to qualify for affordable healthcare. All of those notions have a disproportionate effect on African Americans, though they affect every American in the United States. Remember, Judge Kavanaugh would be appointed to a Court that already has a majority appointed by Republican Presidents. Yet, while sitting on the D.C. court of appeals, he has distinguished himself by seeking to overturn longexisting precedent, even when members of that court, also appointed by Republican Presidents, have disagreed with him. Let me give an example in an area of criminal law. We now see African Americans in the streets protesting overzealous law enforcement because African American men have been shot and killed and people go to the streets because, if you can’t get justice to the courts, that is all they have. b2030 Yet, Judge Kavanaugh has suggested that it is appropriate for the probable cause standard to be more ‘‘flexible.’’ Why? Virtually no police have indeed been indicted, even given the evidence of African Americans shot down in the streets. Why do we need to narrow the ancient probable cause requirement? He has indicated that police searches without a warrant or individualized suspicion should be allowed. He has even praised narrowing the rights long ago afforded to all defendants against incriminatory statements against themselves. How deep does that go in American constitutional law? How dangerous would it be to have a justice who would question the right against self incrimination? Judge Kavanaugh’s extreme views also show no respect for the fundamental right of women to make decisions about their own bodies, even though, 45 years ago, the Supreme Court itself established the right to abortion. That is a controversial right in our country, but it has withstood the test of time. Let me offer an indication from a recent decision by Brett Kavanaugh, which his own court had to overturn, that shows he has no respect for precedent. That is perhaps our chief issue with this nominee. Precedent must be respected or else we are all open to whatever Congress or the Court wants to do. A young woman, immigrant, undocumented, sought an abortion. As it turns out, she had gone through the most rigorous of requirements, those required by Texas, because that is where she entered the country. This matter came to the D.C. court of appeals, however. Judge Kavanaugh found, with the time running—remember, if abortions are to be performed, they are to be performed, according to the Supreme Court, as early as possible—found that more time was needed because she needed a sponsor, something that the Supreme Court has never required, in order for that abortion to occur. The court overturned Judge Kavanaugh’s opinion. Look how dangerous it would have been. She could have gone past the 12week, the 15week, the 20week deadline, which the House has approved on occasion. These are rights not to be tampered with, but he has already tampered with them on the court of appeals. This court, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia—and I won’t go into all the cases—has shown that he is an executiveoriented justice. That is to say, whatever the President wants, the President gets. This is the court that looks at most administrative law decisions before they go anywhere else. Kavanaugh tried to strike down the net neutrality rule. Now, that is controversial here in Congress. But the basis he used for the courts to do it, the majority said—remember, this is a majority which our Republican President has appointed—the majority noted that the dissent was, using their words, ‘‘misconceived’’ because Kavanaugh claimed a First Amendment protection for large internet service providers never found by any court, and certainly not the Supreme Court but found to be, again, by his Republican colleagues on the D.C. Circuit, to be ‘‘counterintuitive.’’ I cannot go through each and every one of Judge Kavanaugh’s decisions here, but I must point to perhaps his most extreme opinion. In a decision on the Affordable Care Act, this is what a jurist in the United States of America said, and I quote: ‘‘Under the Constitution, the President may decline to enforce a statute that regulates private individuals when the President deems the statute unconstitutional, even if a court has held or would hold the statute constitutional.’’ That is bold. It says that the President may choose to rise above the law and enforce a law even if found unconstitutional. The Congress of the United States should not be willing to go along with this. I cite a case on my side of an issue but surely you can see the implications for yours. The President is supposed to make sure to ‘‘take care that the laws are faithfully executed.’’ To faithfully execute that law, you would have to enforce whatever the Congress or the Courts had found. Of course, most concerning for many is his view of the special counsel where he has opined that it may be unconstitutional, and there is every reason to believe that he may well believe that Mueller’s special counsel role should be struck down. A Republican President is entitled to a Republican nominee. He is not entitled to a nominee whose opinions fly in the face of the law for the last 75 years. Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s long list of opinions mark an extreme departure from established American constitutional and other law. We ask that every effort be made to oppose a man who would ignore established precedent, even precedent that his own conservative colleagues agree with, and who, I believe, cannot uphold the law fairly to protect the rights of all American citizens. We believe that the first to feel the effect of such a nominee would be the millions of Americans who are of African American ancestry whom the Congressional Black Caucus represents. I thank my good friend, again, from New York, for permitting me to go on at length about some of the precedents I have discovered that I thought would be particularly troubling, not only to the African American community, but to the American people. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia for her scholarship, her legal acumen, and really providing a snapshot—because I am sure there are many more troubling decisions that you have uncovered—but giving us this snapshot into the breaking of norms that this nominee presents to the American people. It is really important that we do everything within our power to educate and inform the public so that they can make an informed choice in terms of how they would like to proceed in appealing to the United States Congress, which has the authority for the nomination process. At this time, again, I would like to thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I yield now to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ), who is my classmate and a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for the time today to address this august body. Let me first compliment the gentlewoman from Washington, D.C., Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON , a true legal scholar, a legal patriot, and a fighter for justice throughout her life. Mr. Speaker, I want to issue this quote to you: ‘‘No President has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.’’ Mr. Speaker, those were the first words spoken by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, introduced to the American people during President Trump’s primetime reality show announcement this past Monday night. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to voice my deep concerns regarding the President’s nomination of Judge Kavanaugh 
for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. It is more than a little disquieting that the first thing to come from a newly named Supreme Court nominee’s mouth was a demonstrably false statement claiming that the search to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy was one of the most farreaching and thorough in the history of the republic. The truth is, Mr. Speaker, that President Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh from a preapproved list of prospective rightwing ideologue nominees prepared by the extremist Heritage Foundation, in consultation with the cultish rightwing Federalist Society, each of those nominees having been certified as having passed the Federalist Society, Heritage Foundation litmus test on overturning Roe v. Wade and striking down critical protections in our current healthcare system. Just 10 days after Justice Kennedy announced his retirement, Judge Kavanaugh makes the absurd statement that no President has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination. We have come to expect knowing false Trumpian statements from the President’s employees, his doctor, communications directors, his press secretaries, but not from a nominee for the branch of government designated to be a check on his administration. In just a few words, Judge Kavanaugh aligned himself with the likes of erstwhile press secretary Sean Spicer, who claimed that Trump’s inauguration crowd was larger than Obama’s. He put himself in the same league with the disgraced doctor who felt it necessary to tell the world the spurious claim that the President was the healthiest human being in world history. That a distinguished Federal appellate judge felt the need to debase himself with obvious untruths just moments after his nomination to the highest court in the land was announced should cause each and every one of us to fear that a Justice Kavanaugh would willingly prostrate himself before a demanding President if called upon to do so. Moreover, each and every one of us has good cause to believe that the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh is a blatant attempt by President Trump to dominate the judiciary. b2045 A President with the power and the predisposition to place his heavy hand on the delicate scales of justice would inevitably lead our dear Nation to the precipice of a constitutional crisis. That is why it is of such concern to me that nominee Kavanaugh felt it necessary to flatter this insecure President during their prime time reality show at the White House last week. In Washington, we talk a lot about the balance of powers, but at home, in Georgia, we feel it. We feel the 5–4 Shelby decision striking down important parts of the Voting Rights Act. We feel Roe v. Wade guaranteeing women the right to choose. We feel Citizens United. And we feel Brown v. Board of Education. We recall the power of the courts to decide so much more than individual cases. We have seen its ability to change the course of history. When one considers the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, we know firsthand that the U.S. Supreme Court can turn the American Dream into the American nightmare. Without digressing, I must point out that to conclude that a sycophantic debut is where Judge Kavanaugh’s problems begin and end would be dangerously naive. The briefest of examinations of his record reveals numerous positions contrary to the values held by most Americans. He has opposed EPA protections, workers’ rights, consumer protections, and the right to choose. And his personal statements call to question his ability to be an independent check on the President, such as his declarations that investigations of presidents should be deferred while that president is in office, and his opinion that a sitting president is immune from criminal charges. These statements should be particularly troubling for all Americans, as the Supreme Court may soon be called upon to consider whether President Trump can be subpoenaed to appear before a Federal grand jury, or whether a sitting president can be indicted. Our democracy will need an unbiased and principled Supreme Court functioning at its finest, with due respect for the rule of law, when that time comes, and a justice who has prejudged, as Judge Kavanaugh has, would jeopardize that responsibility. To avoid any appearance of impropriety, the Senate should not consider a Supreme Court appointment from a president who is under the cloud of investigation for conspiracy to violate the law and the obstruction of that investigation. Judge Kavanaugh’s statements clearly make him suspect, and his confirmation would undermine the credibility of the Nation’s highest court and impugn that court’s ability to protect public confidence in the rule of law. With this cloud hanging over Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, it is necessary that the Senate refrain and keep with its tradition and follow the McConnell rule. Elections are less than 4 months away and we should allow the American people to speak at the ballot box before the Senate is asked to confirm a nominee for the highest court in the land. The delay would help ensure that Justice Kennedy’s replacement is free from suspicion and bias and the inability to appreciate balance of powers concerns. Judge Kavanaugh has gone beyond his clear proclivity for being an activist judge out of line with the rest of the country. He has revealed himself to be beholden to another branch of government, which would imperil our Constitution’s delicate balance of powers. Americans deserve a United States Supreme Court justice who is up to the task of protecting the rule of law without fear or favor, and, unfortunately, Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment is ill considered, illtimed, and should not move forward. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Fourth District of Georgia for sharing his analysis this evening. Indeed, he has raised some very important points that we need to consider and that I would like the American people to consider. There is a McConnell rule. That rule held up the nomination of Merrick Garland for almost a year. The context which that was done was that apparently there were going to be elections down the road and the American people should speak. Well, here we are less than 5 months out before there will be an election here in the United States of America. I think the people have an opportunity, and should use that opportunity through their franchise, to register their concerns about this nomination process. Nearly 150 years ago, Black Americans were granted the right to vote. It will be another 100 years before people of color could freely vote in every State, county, and city in the United States of America. We have fought tooth and nail for the most sacred power in America—the power to vote— and now that power is being challenged with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In 2012, Judge Kavanaugh wrote an opinion that upheld South Carolina’s restrictive voter ID laws, despite knowing they would disenfranchise voters and disproportionately harm people of color. Voter ID laws are another thinly veiled attempt at preventing people of color from participating in elections. Kavanaugh’s support of these laws show what side of history he is on. This isn’t the only questionable decision he has made regarding race relations. He has a long history of concerning decisions and writings. In 1989, Kavanaugh published his first piece of legal writing challenging a Supreme Court ruling that barred prosecutors from excluding jurists based on race. Imagine that: 1989. Kavanaugh also wrote a brief for the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative think tank that opposed affirmative action and opposed the issue in a number of different court cases. Kavanaugh is also a firm supporter of the NSA, and its surveilling techniques that have been known to disproportionately target people of color. 
The NAACP opposed Kavanaugh’s nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court, and their concerns were only strengthened by his proven track record of only supporting the already wealthy and powerful. In 2000, Kavanaugh was on the legal team that helped stop the Florida recount and secure the Bush Presidency. Just last year, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion concerning whether a pregnant 17yearold being held by immigration authorities was allowed to leave their custody to obtain an abortion. We are not dealing with someone who is a mystery here. It is very clear where he stands in terms of turning back the hands of time. And, as my colleagues have already stated, his opinions have been so far to the right of even a Republican D.C. Circuit Court, that it is alarming that at a time when we need justice at the Supreme Court level that is blind, that will advance humankind, this is the nominee, the nominee that was put forth by the Heritage Foundation, the nominee that is a part of the Federalist society: very telling. Well, let me just say this: In Texas, the court ruled in agreement that that teenager, who was seeking an abortion, was legally entitled to access it. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I will just say a few remarks. As a Black woman, I know how critical the Supreme Court is to American liberty and freedom. It was the Supreme Court that ended segregation with Brown v. Board of Education, ended the process of poll taxes and voter suppression with Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections, and has continued to stand up for American justice when Donald Trump and our Congress could not. The legacy of this great institution will crumble if we confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressional Black Caucus and Congresswoman YVETTE CLARKE for anchoring this important Special Order. On the 150th Anniversary of the ratification of the 14th Amendment, a landmark moment for progress and equality, the President announced his nominee to fill a seat on the highest court in the land. Unfortunately, however, the search for the next jurist to take a seat on the United States Supreme Court resembled a circus and I am concerned that the person selected, Brett Kavanaugh, will be antagonistic and hostile to the progress that the 14th Amendment has helped achieve. As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, I am appalled by the manner in which the President is pursuing this solemn obligation and concerned by the choice this process may yield. The President has used the levers of his office to divide, rather than unite. The Supreme Court is not just any court. In our great Republic, it is the tribunal of last resort and routinely resolves constitutional questions of first impression. The American people rely on it to interpret some of society’s most difficult policy concerns, and to correct the excesses of the popularlyelected branches. The nature of the Court requires justices, not ideologues, and individuals who have integrity and empathy. This is why this task requires seriousness and solemnity, and not spectacle. Instead, this process resembled a circus: contenders were selected based on their ability to pass a litmus test of a narrow perspective of conservativism which limits justice; a group of judges, similar in background, training and experience, curated by the hyperconservative Federalist Society; and, a heavily promoted, prime time television announcement, replete with different frontrunner candidates on different days. Given this reality, Americans are rightly concerned that the President’s jurist selection to one of this country’s three coequal branches of government is being outsourced to the whims of a narrow ideological and partisan organization when, in actuality, a seat on the Supreme Court should be reserved for only the most profound jurists in the nation. By great numbers, the American people support reform in any number of areas. In a time of mass incarceration and overcrowded prisons, a poll conducted earlier this year by a Republicanleaning organization indicates that over threequarters of the American people support significant criminal justice reform. Americans are also skeptical of comments made by this President, advocating for the deprivation of due process rights for a variety of individuals, from refugees seeking safety within our borders, to those already here, charged with crimes. Indeed, a poll commissioned by the Bucknell Institute for Public Policy within the last year reveals broad and deep support for due process rights. In a time when our political parties appear polarized, 67 percent of Democrats, 77 percent of Republicans and 67 percent of Independents support due process for individuals who face serious criminal charges. Last, the Supreme Court is also the tribunal that resolves major questions about the form and contours of our federal government, including sensitive questions like ‘‘can a sitting president pardon himself?’’ or ‘‘can a sitting president be indicted?’’ In fact, for over the past year of this President’s administration, the country has been forced to consider these questions as it learned that the Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election and associates of the president may have abetted that endeavor. Recent polls indicate that, by clear margins, the American people do not believe the President is above the law or that a president can pardon himself. It is vital that this extremely influential position is filled by someone who subscribes to these core principles. Brett Kavanaugh, however, has demonstrated a longstanding record of troubling opinions, including the beliefs that: the president is above the law and should never be criminally indicted; the Affordable Care Act should be dismantled; religious expression trumps individuals’ right to health coverage for birth control; access to abortion should be diminished; and Obamaera environmental regulations should be rolled back. The Supreme Court is also required to examine contemporary policies through the prism of our nation’s long history. In that regard, the ongoing struggle for civil rights cannot be subjugated as a priority of a nation seeking to bind the wounds of the slavery, the Civil War and its vestiges. The next jurist will replace a Supreme Court justice who recognized the importance of affirmative action as a necessary means to help heal the scars of segregation and Jim Crow. The next jurist will likely be required to further calibrate the balance of power between labor unions and their employing entities. Given the importance of these and other issues, like voting rights, reproductive rights, the rights of the LGBTQ community, and countless others, scholars of the Supreme Court and others who believe the Court is the arbiter of fair justice are looking to this nomination and are looking for a jurist who will dispense justice which is not onesided or tilts to the right, but rather fair justice. As I stated before the nomination, I call upon the United States Senate to reject any nominee that is a welldocumented ideologue and to nonetheless probatively, seriously, and deeply question whether and how this jurist could damage rights of minorities, women, children, and society’s most vulnerable. When confronted with a replacement to the Supreme Court’s swing vote, this President has chosen an ideologue and a foot soldier of the Republican Party and the conservative movement. Among other swing decisions, Justice Kennedy acted as the deciding vote in almost every reproductive health case since his confirmation, including casting the deciding vote to ensure abortion remained legal in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992. The President has stated numerous times that he will appoint someone who will reverse Roe v. Wade, and many antichoice groups have rallied behind Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. In addition to women’s rights and health care, other paramount issues are on the line, such as voting rights and affirmative action. Bedrock civil rights principles such as Brown v. Board of Education could be at stake. To be sure, Brett Kavanaugh has very good credentials but an undistinguished record as a jurist on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But it is not his credentials or his pedigree that is worrisome. Rather, throughout his entire career—as a deputy in the rightwing crusade against President Bill Clinton during the 1990s, as a political operative fighting against the statewide recount in Florida in 2000, paving the way for the Supreme Court’s decision in Bush v. Gore, and as a conservative stalwart on the country’s most important federal appellate court— Brett Kavanaugh has used his talents in the service of decidedly and uncompromisingly reactionary causes. I urge the United States Senate to reject this nomination and send this President a message: select a nominee that will not politicize the Court and one who will protect the rights of minorities, women, children, and society’s most vulnerable. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. G OHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to be here. It is an honor to speak in this historic room where Franklin D. Roosevelt stood right there, though back then it was a white marble podium at which he stood, and asked for a declaration of war after Pearl Harbor. He went on to join forces with a despicable man named Stalin, who killed millions upon millions of people, and he didn’t hide it very well. b2100 For those who knew how destructive Stalin had been, how truly evil he was, it was quite a blow for people to see Franklin Roosevelt as President of the United States, where we believe in freedom, sit and smile and pal around with one of the worst mass murderers in the history of the world named Stalin, starving millions upon millions in Ukraine. I mean, for heaven’s sake, in World War II, they didn’t relieve Poland of oppression from Nazi Germany. They took over the oppression of Poland from Nazi Germany. There were some, one remarkable General named Patton, who understood how dangerous the communist dictator was. But so many have been miseducated over the years, the last 40 years. I saw the beginnings of it in the 1970s when I was in school, how wonderful socialism was, how wonderful communism was. But that was just a very small minority, because most Americans understood—they had been properly educated growing up—how great our freedom is, how unusual it is, and that it doesn’t last forever, that it takes constant defense. Again, the comment by Benjamin Franklin, when asked: What you have given us? He said: ‘‘A republic, madam, if you can keep it,’’ because it doesn’t endure forever. As I have met with people around the world, from Togo, Nigeria, all across the Middle East and Asia, even the little Maldives islands, remote islands in the Philippines, all the way across to America, around the world, it is amazing how many people see America as their only hope for having peace in this life. Franklin Roosevelt felt like the threat of Nazi Germany justified his actions in joining forces with an evil, terrorist dictator, a mass murderer like Stalin. But he also joined forces with Winston Churchill, who also could see the rising threat of communism through Russia. But now, not so many see the threat anymore. Yes, the President is over there in Helsinki today, talking to Vladimir Putin. In my conversation with him about over a year and a half ago, he certainly understood the threat that Russia is to us. But so is misinformation about what is real, what is true. And I was listening to some of my colleagues before me. I have been listening to people on the news talking about Judge Kavanaugh. Frankly, he was not my first choice out of those who the President could have chosen. To say slavery would be coming back if he goes on the Supreme Court, I heard that. Actually, if he were to go to the Supreme Court, it appears pretty clear he would try to help the Court be slaves to the Constitution instead of their own shadows of penumbras that things need to be in the Constitution. Until it is amended, we have to go by what is there. I have heard ongoing, constant claims that voters and votes will be denied, and I would have to agree that they will for all of those who attempt to vote illegally. That is what voter ID is about. My understanding was, after voter ID went into place, Alabama, Georgia, where I understood that statistics were kept, well, the numbers of voters went up dramatically for minorities. It didn’t hurt minority voting. But what it certainly did do is ensure better integrity in the outcome of votes. I recall hearing one night David Brinkley talking, I believe, to Tom Brokaw, and he was encouraged to tell about a story he heard Lyndon Johnson tell. He said, you know, back then, before Watergate, reporters were close, big buddies with the President, and he would come down sometimes and sit in the press room, plop his boots up on a desk, scratching his belly, and having a beer, and told a story, in essence, of when he ran for Congress. He was out in the cemetery with his campaign manager before the election, late at night. They were writing down the names on the tombstones of people who would be voting in his election. They came to one that was just such a mess, moss and all kinds of crud on the tombstone. The campaign manager said, come on, Lyndon, let’s just move to the next one. He grabbed his campaign manager and said, no, sir. This man has every bit as much a right to vote as anybody else in this cemetery. Well, everybody laughed. Except if you read about what happened in Duval County during his election, you would begin to think that perhaps was a firsthand, true story. Whether humorous or not, there are so many examples of fraudulent voting. I know people keep saying, oh, gee, there is no such thing. But that is garbage. There is plenty of fraud in votes in America. Of course, as long as you can prevent people from having IDs like you have to have to get into the Department of Justice when Eric Holder was the Attorney General, when Loretta Lynch was Attorney General—currently, you couldn’t get into the Democratic National Convention without a proper government ID. Anyway, photo IDs are pretty routine. You have to have them to get cigarettes, alcohol. You have to have them to do much of anything, to cash a check. Because of rulings by the Supreme Court, you have to make an accommodation for those who couldn’t afford to pay for a photo ID. Then they can get them for free. So it just seems like a lot of scare tactics being used. Donald Trump was not my first choice in the election, but one of the things I have noticed, if he loses on something, he is going to come back and try to make the people who caused the unnecessary and inappropriate loss wish they hadn’t forced that loss, like in this situation, perhaps. If the scare tactics about slavery coming back—and I know we will be hearing a lot of the Bork lines. We are already hearing some of the Bork lines that were lies about Judge Bork. Some of those, since they worked to lie about Judge Bork, they may work to lie about Kavanaugh, so we will probably be hearing some of those resurrected. But I can’t help but wonder if all these lies said about Kavanaugh were successful as they were about Bork, wow, I just wonder about the next person that President Trump might appoint. I can hear people walking out of this Chamber someday, saying maybe it seemed pretty clear we should have let Kavanaugh go through, because he really wasn’t as bad as we said he was. But that will be an interesting time down the road. I didn’t plan to talk about Judge Kavanaugh, but he seems like a very decent man. Wow, the attacks on a decent family man, Catholic, caring man, it is just amazing how far things have come in America. But I think it is important, with all the screams about Russia, to understand Russia and the former Soviet Union were, indeed, a grave threat to the United States. McCarthy was partially right. He went much too far, and he got very abusive, but there was a threat. He just went too far, became too abusive, and we don’t need that. Let me parenthetically insert that there is nothing abusive about questioning a serial liar about how he became so good at serial lying. Infidelity is not particularly an issue, not relevant, really. It is relevant to security clearances, certainly, because that can make somebody vulnerable to being turned by foreign intelligence. But for purposes of our hearings, like before the Judiciary Committee, credibility is always relevant. When a person has been a serial liar, that is relevant in whatever context he became a serial liar. There is an article by Steven Allen dated June 23, 2018. ‘‘Political leaders and journalists are deeply concerned about Russian meddling in U.S. elections. Took ‘em long enough. The Russians have been meddling in U.S. elections for at least 70 years. ‘‘In 1948, the Progressive Party’’— there are some I know who are thinking the Democratic Party should change their name to Progressive 
Party, and there are those advocating such things. They like to informally call themselves the progressives. But, ‘‘In 1948, the Progressive Party, front for the Sovietcontrolled Communist Party, ran former Vice President Henry Wallace as its Presidential candidate. Wallace arguably threw the election to President Truman by attacking him, undercutting Republicans’ claims that Truman was ‘soft’ on the Russians.’’ This is a quote from October 21, 1956: ‘‘President Eisenhower today accused Soviet Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin of meddling in the American election campaign,’’ the United Press reported. Again, that is October 21, 1956. ‘‘Bulganin had suggested that Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson was more likely to get an agreement halting Hbomb tests. That, Eisenhower said, constituted ‘interference by a foreign nation in our internal affairs . . . in the midst of a national election campaign.’ ‘‘Historian Bruce Dearstyne reported that the Russian Ambassador in 1960 invited Stevenson’’—that is Adlai Stevenson ‘‘to the Embassy, ‘plied’ him with ‘drinks, caviar, and fruit,’ and offered to back him if he would run for President again. Stevenson rejected the offer.’’ That was the Russian Ambassador in 1960, clearly attempting to interfere. ‘‘Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Premier in 1960, bragged in his memoirs that, ‘By waiting to release the U–2 pilot Gary Powers until after the American election, we kept Nixon from being able to claim that he could deal with the Russians; our ploy made a difference of at least half a million votes, which gave Kennedy the edge he needed.’’’ So you got Nikita Khrushchev bragging that he got John F. Kennedy elected. I am not saying that. I am just reading what is historically available. ‘‘In 1968, under orders from Moscow, the Soviet U.S. Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin offered to secretly fund Hubert Humphrey’s Presidential campaign. The offer was made during a breakfast at Humphrey’s home. Dobrynin wrote in his memoirs that Humphrey declined the offer, saying, ‘It was more than enough for him to have Moscow’s good wishes, which he highly appreciated.’’’ That was the 1960s Democratic Party hero Hubert Humphrey. ‘‘In 1976, Senator Henry ‘Scoop’ Jackson, a strong antiCommunist, ran for President. The Russians sent forged FBI letters to journalists claiming that Jackson was a closeted homosexual.’’ Of course, today, that would probably get him elected, but in 1976, not so helpful. b2115 Also in 1976, the Russians had a spy among top Democratic Party activists, who participated in a 3hour strategy session with Governor Jerry Brown of California and presidential candidate Jimmy Carter. In 1984, The Heritage Foundation issued a report: ‘‘How Moscow Meddles in the West’s Elections.’’ ‘‘’Last year the Soviets tried to influence elections in West Germany and Britain,’ Heritage reported. ‘And this year, it is America’s turn. For months, Moscow’s statements and actions have been aimed at defeating Ronald Reagan.’ Methods included manipulation of the peace movement, threatening statements, and ‘direct appeals’ to voters including ‘mass demonstrations.’ Russian meddling was so frequent that the West German chancellor commented, ‘One was used to this sort of thing.’ ‘‘As far as I can tell, the report exposing Russian meddling received no news coverage. ‘‘Political scientists Lawrence Caldwell and Robert Levgold pointed out that the Russians had begun to focus on such tactics as looking for ‘exploitable differences in the opposing camp’ and appealing to the people ‘over the heads of their government.’ ‘‘U.S. media during this time gave lots of exposure to Americans who bypassed the government to communicate directly with the Russians. For example, a 10yearold girl from Maine, who wrote a propeace letter to Russian leader Yuri Andropov, was given her own Disney Channel program about politics, ‘Samantha Smith Goes to Washington.’ ‘‘Among those seeking to work with the Russians was U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy, Democrat from Massachusetts, brother of martyred President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. According to a KGB memo,’’—of course, this has been news years ago—‘‘Kennedy passed along a plan for countering President Reagan by creating proRussia news coverage and bringing Soviet officials to the United States to ‘appeal directly to the American people.’’’ KGB Chief Viktor Chebrikov wrote, ‘‘’The Senator underlined the importance that this initiative should be seen as coming from the American side.’ ‘‘In a 2015 article, Politifact’’ which I can’t give a lot of credence to, ‘‘quoted Ken Adelman, Reagan’s deputy U.N. ambassador, explaining that the Reagan Administration ignored the Kennedy overture because ‘We knew Senators were doing this sort of thing all the time.’ ‘‘Russian meddling declined after the Cold War, then resumed. ‘‘‘Occupy Wall Street’ protests,’’— and this is important news—‘‘‘Occupy Wall Street’ protests, beginning in 2011, were heavily supported by the Russians, as noted in a report by U.S. intelligence agencies: ‘RT’s, Russia Today, Editor in Chief . . . characterized RT’s coverage of the Occupy Wall Street movement as ‘information warfare’ that is aimed at promoting popular dissatisfaction with the U.S. government. RT created a Facebook app to connect Occupy Wall Street protesters via social media,’ and ‘RT featured its own hosts in Occupy rallies.’’’ Obviously in 2011 and 2012—this isn’t in the article—but obviously the Russians were playing heavily in that election, and we had a President named Obama that could have done something to stop the Russians from trying to throw the election to the Obama campaign by harming the Republicans and helping the Occupy Wall Street movement, but the Obama administration did nothing of the sort. Back to the article, it says, ‘‘At least since 2011, the Russians have funneled money to groups in the United States and Europe opposed to fracking, which threatens Russia’s dominance in oil and gas.’’ And in fairness with regard to the Russian funding efforts to stop the fracking that has made the United States the biggest oil producer, those efforts weren’t entirely Russian. Yes, our ability to produce more oil has directly harmed Russia, but it has also hurt the Middle East. And you can find that there were programs and videos funded by people in the Middle East to scare Americans to put them against fracking so that Russia and the Middle East could go back to being where most of the oil was coming from. Anyway, this article says, ‘‘To do this,’’ talking about opposing fracking, the Russians ‘‘use a network of front organizations that include corporations, law firms, and nonprofit groups, with some of the money getting into the United States through Bermuda. ‘‘Facing criticism from Republicans over his softonPutin policies, President Obama sought during his 2012 reelection campaign, to avoid confrontation with the Russians.’’ Of course, inserted parenthetically here, when he knew the Russians were helping his campaign and hurting Mitt Romney’s campaign, then, of course, maybe that played into his decision not to try to stop the Russians meddling in the U.S. election. ‘‘The Russians cooperated. In March 2012, Obama was heard on an open microphone telling Putin sidekick Dmitry Medvedev that he would ‘have more flexibility’ after the election but ‘it’s important for him to give me space.’ Medvedev replied: ‘I will transmit this information to Vladimir, and I stand with you.’’’ So maybe that had something to do with the Obama administration not wanting to confront Russia about their meddling, because they were meddling on behalf of Obama. In any event, the article says, ‘‘Time and time again, Russia meddled. It was, ‘the experts’ said, something we were used to, something that happened all the time, no big deal. Then, one day, Democrats need an excuse for losing an election. And everything changed.’’ So an interesting article there by Steven J. Allen, June 23. Mr. Speaker, it is rather tragic that we had a hearing on Friday: I didn’t 
violate the rules of the House; many of my Democratic colleagues did. You are not supposed to interrupt, rudely interrupt another Member’s time, constantly yelling, He needs to take his meds. That is a violation of the rule. I didn’t call anybody on the rule violations. But it is certainly not a violation of the House rules—and I hope my colleagues will understand—when a witness is sitting there lying through his teeth, it is permissible to call him exactly what he is: a liar; in Strzok’s case, a serial liar. I saw it during his closeddoor testimony. Some of us talked about this guy, he looked so good, you know, he looked like he could pass any polygraph test. And then I find out, well, actually, he had a couple of deceptions indicated along the way, but apparently he had people inside the FBI helping keep him in his top position as one of the top leaders. So apparently he wasn’t quite as good at lying as I thought he was. But we have got to get back to being seekers of truth and not deniers of the opportunity to find it. I mean, our whole civilization stands on the brink of an end when young people today in such big numbers think these activities of socialism, progressivism, communism, that those are good, healthy things. There is only one way you can have socialism or communism: you have got to have dictatorial powers in the hands of either a dictator or a committee and there has got to be very little freedom. The government will let you have freedom, and they will take it away, with every right to do that. This is such an anomaly we have here in the United States. People around the world, and I am not talking about the talking heads in the media and Europe, the EU, Britain, some of the other places, I am talking about people that live in these countries day to day all over the world, so many see us as their chance for some peace in this life. Quoting before, but a man named Ebenezer in Togo, Africa, said: You know, our group here, we are Christians. We know where we go when we die, but our only chance of having peace in this life is if America is strong. Tell leaders in Washington, stop allowing America to get weaker and weaker. Trump wants to see this country get strong. Some of them said how, as a Christian, could you support a guy like Trump, as he had been involved in infidelity in the past. I have people sling that my way. But the Bible addresses such a thing. You know, it talks about: When I was a child, I spoke as a child— that was the Apostle Paul—but when I became an adult, I put aside childish things. And when Donald J. Trump was a Democrat and hung around Bill Clinton, he talked like Bill Clinton, he acted like Bill Clinton. So I forgive him. I would like to do anything we can in this body to help make America stronger so those people, those souls crying out around the world for a strong America so they have a chance at peace will indeed have a chance at peace. We have been given a gift. That is something scripture also addresses: ‘‘To whom much is given, of him much will be required.’’ We have got to do better than this, but there is nothing ever wrong with facing a liar and calling him a liar. And the only thing worse than a serial liar at a hearing in the U.S. Capitol is when the serial liar that has damaged the country, hopefully not irreparably, but damaged it badly, tries to make himself a victim. We have had enough of that. Let’s get back to truth. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
