Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to TrumpCare, the Republican plan to privatize Medicare, penalize working families, and prioritize the wealthy. The Republican majority is in denial about the tremendous gains of the Affordable Care Act in covering tens of millions of people across this Nation. In my home State of Washington, Mr. Speaker, because of the Affordable Care Act, the average annual premium increases have dropped from 18.5 percent, before the passage of the ACA, to 6.7 percent in 2017. The growth of individual enrollment reached nearly 320,000 people in 2015; and with Medicaid expansion in Washington State, the decline in the uninsured plummeted to 7 percent in 2015, from over 13 percent in 2009. 605,000 Washingtonians also gained coverage through Medicaid expansion. All of these gains, Mr. Speaker, are in jeopardy as TrumpCare threatens to strip 20 million people, many of whom voted for Mr. Trump, of their health care. Across the Nation, older Americans will be forced to pay premiums five times higher than what others will pay for health care. Four hundred of the wealthiest families in America will be handed a tax break worth $7 million a year, all on the backs of working families. According to the Tax Policy Center, under TrumpCare, the top 0.1 percent of earners would receive an average tax cut of $197,000, while older Americans would face increases of almost $7,000 each. Under TrumpCare, many employers will stop providing coverage, letting their employees fend for themselves with a tax credit. Compared to the subsidies that Americans have today, the tax credits will end up being a tax hike. Not only does TrumpCare impose radical new restrictions on a woman’s right to comprehensive health coverage, it defunds Planned Parenthood, robbing women with nowhere else to turn of essential preventative care and affordable contraceptives. Mr. Speaker, these are sad, sad facts. But the stories from hundreds of my constituents are even more heartbreaking. Lynn told me: If I were to get a bad illness, it would kill me financially. And the stress alone from having my health insurance taken is causing me health problems already. 
Luke wrote to tell me that when his wife needed emergency gall bladder surgery while he was a student, the bills would have been crushing. He said: 
Without the ACA, we would have been saddled with nearly $40,000 in hospital bills, ER, one surgery, and one overnight stay. 
Without contraceptive care that is covered in the ACA, I would never be able to afford my IUD. I might have an unwanted pregnancy, and I wouldn’t be able to afford another child. This means so much to me as a woman, a mother, and as a human. I am able to have power to make decisions about my family, and this means the world to me. 
The lessons and stories like this, Mr. Speaker, are what we should be incorporating into our legislative deliberations, not cynical attempts to penalize people for wanting to have basic health insurance coverage for themselves and their families. What is worse, the Republican majority seems intent on obscuring the real cost of this misguided proposal. Mr. Speaker, the majority deserves this President. They are cut from the same cloth and relying on the power of obfuscating the truth. Since President Trump is not being forced to be transparent about his taxes or his financial entanglements with foreign interests like Russia, the Republican majority doesn’t think that they need to ask the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to offer the true picture of how many people will be hurt by their bill and how much it will cost the American people. This is simply no way to govern. At the most fundamental level, health care is a human right and not a luxury, as our Republican colleagues would have us believe; a healthy population is a healthy workforce; a healthy workforce is a healthy economy; and a healthy economy is a healthy nation. TrumpCare puts all Americans at risk. Let’s work together to protect and expand our health care and put this mess behind us. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF PATRICK LOWERY COGGINS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a young man from my district, Patrick Lowery Coggins. Pat recently passed away at the young age of 27 after a courageous and lifelong battle with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Despite the challenges he faced, Pat lived a full and inspirational life, graduating from high school and college and then returning home to work in communications for the Syracuse Chiefs AAA baseball team. I had the distinct honor and privilege of meeting Pat when he and his Central New York United teammates won the National Power Wheelchair Soccer Tournament in 2015. Pat and his teammates were incredible advocates for increased opportunities for individuals with disabilities. And I might add that I got in one of those power wheelchairs and tried to do what Pat did playing soccer, and it was not easy. So I commend him for his skill in that regard as well. b1015 Pat was beloved by his family, friends, coworkers, and so many in our community. He made a lasting and positive impact on all who knew and loved him. In Pat’s memory, and for all of those who suffer from rare and incurable diseases, we must continue to invest in research, treatments, and cures. Rest in peace, Pat. 
END HUNGER NOW The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this week, the Food Research & Action Center, known as FRAC, and Feeding 
America, in conjunction with the National Child and Adult Care Food Program Forum, hosted their annual fly in. Over 1,200 hunger advocates from every State came to Washington, D.C., to meet with their local Members of Congress and to emphasize the importance of the Federal antihunger programs in alleviating food insecurity and poverty amongst our most vulnerable constituents. These advocates delivered powerful messages to Members of Congress: as we consider the FY 2018 budget and appropriations legislation, and as we work to craft a 2018 farm bill, our antihunger safety net must stay intact. That means no block grants or structural changes to SNAP; no funding cuts to SNAP or any other antihunger programs. These advocates, Mr. Speaker, also delivered paper plates to their Members of Congress containing powerful messages from constituents who rely on antihunger safety net programs. I would urge all my colleagues to make sure they read these paper plates. These aren’t statistics. These are real human beings. These are our constituents, our brothers and sisters. I would like to read a few of the messages that were sent to me from people in my district. This is from a client at the Northbridge Food Pantry in Massachusetts: ‘‘Without food assistance, I wouldn’t have any other source of nourishment. I have many medical issues, and a proper diet is necessary.’’ This is from, again, another client from the Northbridge Food Pantry: ‘‘Food stamps are important to me and my family because I have lung cancer, and it is next to impossible to find a job, to buy food. My husband barely makes enough to pay the bills, that is not counting food.’’ Also, another client from the Northbridge Food Pantry: ‘‘Food stamps is important to me ’cause I don’t make any money to support myself, let alone I’m disabled and I only make $16 for SNAP. I need food to survive and to stay healthy.’’ This is from a client at Centro Las Americas in Worcester: ‘‘For me, they are very important, so that my children have good balance and nutrition.’’ Also, from Centro Las Americas in Worcester: ‘‘Well, for me, they fill a gap because I am a single father who has a child.’’ This is from a client at the Marie Anne Center in Worcester, Massachusetts: ‘‘I think SNAP is important because it helps, because it helps families.’’ This is from a client at the Amherst Survival Center: ‘‘It means there is food every night.’’ Also, from the Amherst Survival Center: ‘‘I thank God for the food pantry because most of my income goes toward bills. The food pantry really relieves the anxiety of not having enough to go around. Thank you.’’ Also, from the Amherst Survival Center: ‘‘I am in bad health. I can’t work. The food pantry really helps my family. Thanks to the food pantry. Thanks Survival Center.’’ Also, from the Amherst Survival Center: ‘‘It means there is food every night.’’ This is from Loaves and Fishes, a food pantry in Worcester, Massachusetts: ‘‘A person has to live.’’ Also, from Loaves and Fishes: ‘‘It is very important that I get the food stamps. Please don’t take them away. They help me out a lot.’’ This is also from Loaves and Fishes: ‘‘SNAP helps supplement my disability from cancers, but my benefit level has been cut.’’ From the Marie Anne Center, a client writes: ‘‘It is important to keep food stamps because other poor families don’t have money. And the food stamps help them. Also, I think you should keep SNAP because if you take it away, that’s basically you saying that other people won’t eat.’’ This is also from the Northbridge Food Pantry: ‘‘In my given situation, without the local food banks and SNAP, I would not be able to eat three meals per day.’’ From a client at Loaves and Fishes: ‘‘A person has to live.’’ Finally, this is from the Amherst Survival Center. A client writes: ‘‘Thank you, Amherst Survival Center. You are a saving grace.’’ Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to understand that, in the United States of America, the richest country in the history of the world, we have close to 42 million Americans who are food insecure or hungry. They are our neighbors. They are counting on us in this Congress to do something, not to give them a cold shoulder. I will, in all frankness, say to my colleagues that we are not doing nearly enough. Hunger is a political condition. We have the resources, we know what to do, but we don’t have the political will. So, rather than cutting these nutrition safety net programs, rather than threatening to block grant SNAP, cut SNAP, or cut other antihunger and nutrition programs, we ought to come together and support them. We ought to dedicate ourselves to ending hunger now. We have a moral obligation to do that. I urge my colleagues to read the plates that were delivered to their offices and join with me in ending hunger now. 
LET’S FIX, NOT FIGHT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last week, I had the opportunity to gather in Upper Senate Park with thousands of individuals from across the country to demand that Congress ‘‘Fix Not Fight’’ and work together to build a better, safer, and stronger nation. The No Labels Problem Solvers Conference brought together thousands of citizens from across all 50 States to kickstart a year of action in creating a more united path forward for our country. Proudly, I have been part of this movement from the beginning. As a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, I hope we can all come to the table, find common ground, and focus on finding solutions. Of course, there are some areas where we are never going to agree, and that is okay. Our differences should not divide us. Instead, we must exhibit good governance, good leadership, and serve our constituents in a manner that is worthy of the office we hold. After all, the only way that we will build a better America today and for all generations that follow us is if we come together now. Let’s get to work. SUPPORT STUDENT LOAN DEBT RELIEF FOR  
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the cornerstones of our rural communities: our American farmers. These men and women are stewards of all of our land and provide the country with a safe and affordable food supply, but we need to do more to cultivate the next generation of farmers. They face tough odds by the very nature of the business, and there is a critical shortfall of skilled young and beginning farmers and ranchers. That is why, together with Congressman JOECOURTNEY of Connecticut and Congressman JOHNFASOof New York, we introduced the Young Farmer Success Act. This legislation will provide incentives for those who would like to pursue a future in the agriculture industry by adding farmers to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which currently offers loan payback assistance for professions such as government service, teaching, and nursing. Under the program, eligible public service professionals who make 10 years of incomedriven student loan payments can have the balance of their loans forgiven. Farming is an expensive business to enter, in part because of skyrocketing land prices, and beginning farmers often see small profits or even losses in their first years of business. In 2011, the National Young Farmers Coalition conducted a survey of 1,000 young farmers and found that 78 percent of respondents struggled with a lack of capital. A 2014 followup survey of 700 young farmers with student loan debt found that the average burden of student loans was $35,000, and that 53 percent of respondents are currently farming, but have a hard time making their student loan payments; while another 30 percent are interested in farming, but haven’t pursued it as a career because their salary as a farmer wouldn’t be enough to cover their student loan payments. Mr. Speaker, food security is national security and it aids the long 
term sustainability of our country. Our rural communities are in crisis and declining. We should do everything in our power to recruit a new generation of farmers. Did you know that the number of new farmers entering the field of agriculture has dropped by 20 percent and the average farmer age has now risen above 58 years old? We must encourage new farmers to enter this critical industry. I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan Young Farmer Success Act. The skyrocketing cost of higher education and the growing burden of student loan debt are presenting major obstacles for young ranchers. The burden of student loan debt can thwart their ability to purchase the farming operations they need to get started and drive them away from a career in agriculture altogether. Let’s pass this bill and help the men and women who put food on the table for American families throughout America. Our farmers feed, and we should give them every incentive to continue to do so. The American people deserve a safe, reliable, and sustainable food source. Our farmers provide that. 
GOP ACA REPEAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I just came from the Energy and Commerce Committee. That committee, along with the Ways and Means Committee and the Education and the Workforce Committee, is seized of the responsibility to consider the harmful American Health Care Act being offered by the Republicans as a better way. It is anything but a better way. Mr. Speaker, they don’t want the American public to see what they are doing. They met all through the night. They have been meeting now for over 24 hours, without sleep, without rest, without reflection, and with no opportunity, Mr. Speaker, for the American people to see what is going on. In the dead of night, out of the sight of the public, they are hiding their bill and rushing to judgment. Why? Because they know, as they have seen in town meeting after town meeting after town meeting—that is, of course, those Republicans who have had town meetings—that the American public is extraordinarily concerned and worried they are going to lose the health care that they receive through the Affordable Care Act. They are concerned about the premiums and deductibles that they have to pay skyrocketing because of the Republican bill that is being proposed. They are concerned that Medicare and Medicaid are going to be decimated and the life of Medicare reduced in terms of its ability to pay the benefits promised. Mr. Speaker, the President stood at that rostrum and said he had a healthcare bill that was going to give healthcare coverage for everybody—not just some, but everybody—at less expense and greater quality. There is no such bill that the President has provided us with. If there is, and if he has such a bill, Mr. Speaker, I will support it, but it is certainly not the bill that the Ways and Means Committee ended its work on at 4:30 a.m. this morning. The American people, Mr. Speaker, ought to be asking: What are you hiding? What is the rush? You have had 7 years to consider this bill. That is 7 years. We are meeting tomorrow, we are meeting next week, we are meeting the week after. It is not as if we are going on a summer break and we need to rush to judgment. It is not that we need to keep the American people out of consideration of this bill. Mr. Speaker, Democrats in committee and on this floor are doing everything we can to slow down this process and to open the doors, open the windows, and keep the lights on so that the people who deserve to know how a Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act will impact their lives and the lives of their family and their children. b1030 Houses Republicans are marking up this bill without holding a single hearing—not one hearing—for a bill that gives $600 billion in tax cuts and cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from health care. The tax cuts go to the wealthiest in America. Perhaps that is why there are no hearings. Perhaps that is why they didn’t invite any witnesses. Perhaps that is why they are rushing to judgment before the Congressional Budget Office, which is nonpartisan and will give us an accurate estimate of its cost and who is going to be hurt—Mr. Speaker, apparently they don’t want the American people to get those facts before their representatives have to make a decision. I know they voted for repealing the Affordable Care Act almost 65 times here in this House. Democrats have voted against that because we believe the Affordable Care Act is working. Is it working perfectly? No. Do we need to join together and make it work better for the American people? Yes. This bill will impact, Mr. Speaker, every single American family and business. If enacted, it will force Americans across the country to pay more for less coverage and fewer benefits. Shamefully, Republicans are hoping they can jam this bill through the House and Senate before Members have to go home and face their constituents in April. That is why we are having to rush, because they don’t want their Members to go home in April and say: This is what we are considering, what do you think? Because they know. Because they have had hearings, town meetings. They haven’t had any hearings on this bill, but they have had town meetings, and every American has seen the reporting on that, angry Americans fearful that they are going to lose benefits absolutely critical to them and their families. They continued marking up this bill through the night, using the very same tactics they claimed we were using when considering the Affordable Care Act. We had over 79 hearings not in the middle of the night, but during the day. We had over 181 witnesses. That is opposed to zero—zero—witnesses on this bill. Shame. It gives a lie to the representation of transparency and openness and accountability that our Speaker has said he would operate this House to ensure that those happened. They used the same tactics that they claim, as I said, that we were considering. In fact, here is what Tom Price, who was then a member of the House of Representatives, now the Secretary of the Health and Human Services, said: ‘‘The negotiations are obviously being done in secret and the American people really just want to know what they are trying to hide.’’ He said that on January 6, 2010. 180 witnesses, 79 hearings, a year and a half or more of consideration, yet we have a bill that was introduced Monday night. Today is Thursday. Monday night it was introduced, and no hearings. Wednesday, deep into the night, and this morning this bill is being marked up. K EVIN BRADY , the chairman of the Committee on Way and Means, who held a markup until 4:30 a.m., said this: ‘‘I think there is never a more critical time for the American public to weigh in on an important issue than on health care today and there is a lot about this bill we don’t know.’’ He said that in a townhall August 10, 2009. Well, now he is chairman of the committee, and apparently he has decided that the American public doesn’t need to know now. When we were in charge, he thought the public needed to know, and that is why we had those 79 hearings and 181 witnesses and townhalls, thousands of meetings and townhalls around the country on the Affordable Care Act. But Mr. BRADY apparently doesn’t think that is applicable when he is in charge of the committee. Then Speaker, now former Speaker John Boehner said this: ‘‘Can you say it was done openly, with transparency and accountability? Without backroom deals struck behind closed doors, hidden from the people? Hell, no, you can’t.’’ But now the shoe is on the other foot, and my Republican colleagues are in charge. They are full speed ahead, and the doors are closed, the windows are shuttered, and the blinds are drawn. The process we had in 2009 and 2010 to write and adopt the Affordable Care Act included, as I said, 79 hearings versus zero hearings on this bill. Zero. None. 181 witnesses that I have referred to. Zero witnesses, zero Americans included from the public in this process. We had a 2year process that was open and recognized how consequential the 
legislation would be, ensuring that Americans from all over the country, including doctors, healthcare organizations, providers, insurance companies, average citizens could weigh in. Now in their rush to pass their repeal, Republicans are doing everything they said was wrong and much more. Republicans are terrified that the American people will find out what is in this bill. The problem they have is a lot of their Members have found out what is in this bill, and they don’t like it. Hardly any newspaper in America likes it. We think the public is thinking they are moving too fast and are going to hurt them. They are afraid, however, of having to face angry constituents who will see that this bill will take healthcare coverage away from 20 million Americans and cause outofpocket costs to go up for millions more. This bill could destabilize even the employerbased insurance market. That is people who know nothing about the exchange, but they have insurance through their employer. This bill will destabilize their insurance as well. The point is, Mr. Speaker, we don’t know for sure how bad it is. We know it is bad, and that is information we ought to have before being asked to vote on the floor or in committee on such consequential legislation. My Republican friends say, well, we will have a CBO score by the time we consider it on the floor. But they don’t want that information out for very long because it is going to be very negative. Democrats will continue, Mr. Speaker, to do everything in our power to slow down this process and throw back the curtain Republicans have pulled over this bill and this process in an attempt to hide the details of their dangerous plan from the American people. We are ready, as I said, to turn the lights out in this Chamber before we let the Republican repeal bill turn the lights out on coverage and care for millions of our fellow Americans. I do not yield my conviction to oppose this bill as strongly, as long as I possibly can. 
PHILANDER SMITH COLLEGE CELEBRATES THE 140TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS FOUNDING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, the distinguished minority leader from Maryland certainly knows my great affection for him and his leadership of the opposition. We are the opposition here. I have to say that should he not have access to C–SPAN, like all of us, we invite him to tune in to C–SPAN and the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Energy and Commerce and enjoy this long markup, Mr. Leader, and it is quite the contrary. Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HILL. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. It may not be true of your constituents, but most of my constituents were asleep between 12 and 6 this morning. Mr. HILL. I thank the gentleman. Reclaiming my time, I recognize that. But the American people, Mr. Leader, want us to work to correct the deficiencies in the Affordable Care Act, to repeal and replace it, make it better for the American people, to lower premiums, give more access, let people choose the plan they want. I would remind the leader that there was no C–SPAN camera in Ms. PELOSI ’s office when the original Affordable Care Act was cobbled together over Christmas break, certainly not in the light of the American people. So I urge people who are watching C– SPAN today, go to readthebill.gop, understand what is going on to repair and replace the Affordable Care Act, engage with your Member of Congress, and let’s make health care available for all of our citizens. Let’s make it truly affordable. Let’s take care of the least of these, but let’s do it in a patientcentered, marketbased approach. Mr. Speaker, today I come to the House floor to honor my friends at Philander Smith College in Little Rock. They celebrate their Founder’s Day, commemorating the 140th anniversary of their founding in 1877. Philander Smith is a Historically Black College and an early higher education institution built and created by former AfricanAmerican slaves, the first such institution west of the Mississippi River. Graduating thousands of students over its 140year legacy, the college is particularly important to Arkansas’ history, economy, and higher education community. Currently, approximately 760 students are enrolled at Philander Smith, and the college continues to play an integral role in preparing predominantly minority and lowincome students for careers and employment in Arkansas and throughout our country. I always enjoy my opportunities to be on campus, engaging with their bright, dedicated young minds. The college’s president, Dr. Roderick Smothers, recently joined his HBCU colleagues here in Washington to meet with the White House and leadership in Congress and talk about the challenges facing our Historically Black Colleges and their students. I appreciate Dr. Smothers’ dedication to his students and their education at Philander Smith. I am proud to represent such a historic and valuable institution. I congratulate Philander Smith on its 140th anniversary. I look forward to many more decades of their success. 
HATE CRIMES IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, since November’s election, it seems that there have been a rise in incidents of hate crimes in this country. This wave of hate crimes has spread fear and anxiety in communities of different faiths, ethnicities, and cultures across this country. On Tuesday, multiple Jewish community centers, schools, and organizations across the Nation, including in Atlanta, received anonymous bomb threats. This follows a wave of over 120 threats against Jewish community centers across America as well as the senseless desecration of graves at Jewish cemeteries countrywide. I suspect, Mr. Speaker, that these are not unrelated incidents of juvenile delinquents. This is rank, organized antiSemitic activity. It is systematic and organized activity meant to terrorize Jews in America. This comes at a time when Islamophobia is taking root and spreading across America. Mosques are being burned to the ground, Muslim children are being bullied at school, and Muslim women are subjected to having attackers snatching their hijabs from their heads as they walk the streets. The President’s Muslim ban is payback on the pledge he made to his supporters during the campaign. Meanwhile, in February, a 32yearold Indian man was shot and killed, another was wounded, and a third man who intervened was shot and wounded by a gunman shouting ‘‘Get out of my country.’’ b1045 Again, on March 3, a Sikh man was shot in Seattle by an attacker yelling, ‘‘Go back to your country.’’ At that time, the attacker had a mask on. During these incidents, our President has remained uncharacteristically silent on these attacks. His silence comes after his antiMexican, antiMuslim, and antiObama campaign sparked American White nationalists to feel emboldened. This is a dangerous and slippery slope that we are on, ladies and gentlemen. It must end, and it must end now. As Dr. King once said: ‘‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.’’ We must protect all communities that have come under assault. Today I introduce the Reaffirming DHS’ Commitment to Countering All Forms of Violent Extremism Act of 2017 to ensure that countering violent extremism funds within the Department of Homeland Security are used to tackle the rise of rightwing extremism, which threatens the safety of us all here in America. f 
HEALTH CARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is collapsing. It is hurting more people than it is helping. It is forcing Americans to buy insurance they don’t like, they don’t need, and cannot afford. Premiums have increased by an average of 25 percent this year. Deductibles 
are skyrocketing. Nearly 70 percent of U.S. counties have only two or fewer insurers offering plans on their State’s exchanges. Thirtyfour percent fewer doctors and other healthcare providers accept ObamaCare insurance compared to private insurance. Congress must act decisively to protect the American people from this failed law. The American Health Care Act is an important step in this process. While not perfect, it moves us significantly in the right direction, which is why The Wall Street Journal says that the legislation would be ‘‘the most consequential social policy reform since the welfare overhaul of 1996.’’ I am also encouraged that the committees of jurisdiction are, as we speak, entertaining amendments in regular order that will improve the legislation. But even without these amendments, the American Health Care Act is a dramatic improvement over ObamaCare. The bill ends jobkilling individual and employer mandates. It cuts $1 trillion of ObamaCare’s worst taxes, including the medical device tax, the health care insurance tax, and the Medicare payroll tax. It blocks Federal funds from Planned Parenthood. It reduces regulations so that individuals can buy plans that they want and can afford. And it reforms Medicaid by returning power to the States. Some have criticized this bill because it lacks certain important reforms that will bend the cost curve down, such as association health plans, interstate competition, reforms to facilitate more competition and choice in the private health insurance marketplace, and medical liability reform. These are important reforms, and I support them. In fact, I have introduced a medical liability reform bill that would deal with the doctor shortage and junk lawsuits and reduce costs. Unfortunately, these reforms are not eligible for inclusion in the reconciliation bill under the rules of the Senate. But it is important to note that this is just the first phase in a threephase process to repeal and replace ObamaCare. This bill is a crucial and necessary first step in a stepbystep process. In stark contrast to ObamaCare, we are actually reading the bill, and we invite the American people to do the same— readthebill.gop. I hope all Americans will take this opportunity to learn more about this bill and offer their feedback. Mr. Speaker, we have tried to put Washington in charge of health care. Now it is time to put patients, their doctors, and their families in charge. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, last month, a hospital worker in Paducah, Kentucky, applied for a loan of $38,500 to finance a manufactured home. He had an 8 percent down payment. His monthly income was $2,200 per month—plenty to cover the allin housing costs of $670 per month. The payment for his own home would have been less than what he was spending on rent, but he was unable to get financing. He contacted his local banks and credit unions, but they did not finance manufactured homes. This hospital worker from Kentucky can’t get financing because of the very entity that was created to protect consumers—the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That is right, the Federal Government is protecting people right out of homeownership. Consumers are protected so much they can’t even purchase a manufactured home. Lenders have stopped making manufactured housing loans because of the DoddFrank Act and CFPB regulations. Even worse, current owners are having to sell their homes below market value to cash buyers because potential buyers can’t find financing. And this isn’t just anecdotal. Government statistics prove that CFPB rules have prevented creditworthy consumers from accessing affordable financing that would allow them to purchase manufactured homes. According to 2014 HMDA data, manufactured home loan volume for loans under $75,000 decreased in the first year that these regulations went into effect. This is proof that many lenders who were previously willing to make manufactured home loans are no longer capable of doing so under DoddFrank. These are exactly the kinds of top down bureaucratic Federal regulations that my constituents in rural Kentucky are fed up with. The CFPB has the authority to make adjustments to its requirements, but it has refused to act even when the data shows that consumers are being harmed. A bipartisan group of Members of this body came together in the last Congress to do what the CFPB has refused to do. The House voted three times to make these changes so that people seeking to purchase manufactured homes would have access to financing. I invite my colleagues to join me in this fight for consumers. Let’s work together to make these changes to the CFPB and to their regulations and stop Federal bureaucrats from hurting modest income Americans who need access to affordable housing and deserve access to the American Dream of homeownership. f 
GUN VIOLENCE RESEARCH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, each year, about 33,000 Americans die in gunrelated incidents, and twice as many are wounded. Over 60 percent of gun deaths are suicides. Individuals in emotional distress who attempt suicide with a gun rarely survive, so they don’t get the chance to reconsider, to recover, and to live on. Nearly 35 percent of gun deaths in this country are homicides, with one human being using a firearm to take the life of a fellow human being. These homicides occur as a part of the daily drumbeat of violence, particularly in cities, but also our suburbs and small towns. Homicides in certain cities have become so customary they are relegated to the back pages of newspapers or not covered at all. Of course, the lack of public attention does not diminish the private pain felt by a victim’s family and friends. Homicides in America also take place in the context of mass shootings that make headlines because the carnage is so immense. The most recent incident was the deadliest in American history. On June 12, 2016, an individual using a semiautomatic rifle shot 49 people to death and wounded 53 at the Pulse nightclub in my hometown of Orlando. My guest to the President’s address to Congress last week was Dr. Marc Levy, a surgeon in Orlando. He and his team operated on victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting, some of whom had their bodies torn apart. As Dr. Levy and other first responders that fateful evening can attest, a weapon designed for the battlefield transformed a celebration of life into a scene of devastation and death that resembled a war zone. Although Orlando united in the wake of the Pulse attack, earning the label ‘‘Orlando Strong,’’ our city was profoundly and permanently affected by this tragedy. I don’t want another American community to experience what we have endured. That is why today I am introducing legislation that would take a modest but meaningful step forward. Specifically, my bill would ensure that the CDC can offer evidencebased research into the causes of gunrelated incidents and potential ways to reduce gun deaths and injuries. This research would inform policymakers as they consider whether to enact reasonable reforms that both save lives and protect the constitutional rights of law abiding gun owners. The decision rests with elected officials about whether to pass new laws designed to keep the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous individuals, in a manner consistent with the Second Amendment. But lawmakers of both parties should have the benefit of the best scientific research on the subject as they deliberate and debate. My bill is necessary because, for 20 years, Congress has included a policy rider that, as a practical matter, has prevented the CDC and other HHS agencies from supporting research on gunrelated incidents. I can respect that elected officials, like the diverse Americans that they represent, have a range of views about the wisdom of enacting reasonable reforms within the space allowed by the Second Amendment. What I cannot respect is any lawmaker who would seek to suppress research into gunrelated 
incidents merely because the lawmaker fears this research could serve as the basis for legislative action that the lawmaker does not favor. Restricting research because you disagree with its results is unAmerican to its core, a deviation from our proud national tradition of free and open inquiry. As lawmakers, we must recognize that gun incidents are claiming the lives of too many of our citizens and tearing apart too many of our communities. In deciding how best to confront this challenge, we should seek out and sponsor research on this subject, not shun it. For this reason, my bill would repeal the current policy rider and express the sense of Congress that no such policy riders should be enacted in the future. I hope my colleagues will cosponsor this legislation, which underscores the importance of factbased policymaking, and places people before politics. 
TRUMPCARE COSTS MORE AND DELIVERS LESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ) for 5 minutes. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, in listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle this morning, I am struck by the adage, ‘‘You are entitled to your opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.’’ I think it is important to note that the reality of the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 was that there were hundreds of hours of hearings, many opportunities for all Members to provide input, mandatory processes that allowed for changes to that legislation that eventually became law, discussion, and a CBO analysis that shed light on the true cost—nothing like what has been described during the 24 hour whirlwind in the middle of the night that has resulted in the ramming through of legislation that will clearly increase costs and cover fewer individuals. Mr. Speaker, as a mother, a breast cancer survivor, and a proud Floridian, I rise today in opposition to the majority’s irresponsible proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act. After preaching for 7 years about a superior alternative to ObamaCare, my colleagues across the aisle have finally revealed their TrumpCare plan to the American people. As you might expect from TrumpCare, it promises more, delivers less, has fewer protections, and costs more. In other words, it will make America sick again. To add insult to injury, my Republican colleagues have moved this bill under the cover of darkness, without any hearings or even an analysis of its cost from the Congressional Budget Office. However, we do have an earlier CBO report that estimates that 15 million people would lose health insurance just as a result of repealing the individual mandate, which this bill, of course, does. Perhaps even more disturbing is the fact that President Trump told 129 million Americans like me, as a breast cancer survivor with preexisting conditions, that he would preserve the ACA provision prohibiting insurance companies from dropping us or denying us coverage, but he and his Republican colleagues in the House broke their promise and did not keep their word. The bill would once again allow insurance companies to charge people higher premiums when they have a preexisting condition, which will make coverage unaffordable. That is unconscionable. This bill will also punish millions of people who experience a lapse in coverage. Before we had the Affordable Care Act, an estimated 59.1 million people lacked continuous coverage for at least part of the previous year. One of those 59.1 million people was Suzanne Boyd from my district in Sunrise, Florida, who, with two daughters heading to college, was just starting to realize her dream of owing her own special events small business as her full time job. Suzanne had insurance coverage for years through her husband’s employersponsored health plan, until 2012, when her husband, Mark, died of lung cancer. Two weeks later, the family lost their employersponsored health insurance. Only 5 months after that, Suzanne, now widowed and uninsured, was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. As Suzanne has said, before the Affordable Care Act, she wouldn’t even have been able to think about starting her own business. She probably would have looked for another corporate job with health benefits. But knowing she would soon be able to obtain insurance under the ACA and that her preexisting condition couldn’t be held against her when she applied, she started her company in 2013. She eventually qualified for a plan that cost her $192 a month with substantial government subsidies. b1100 Under the Republican plan, people like Suzanne may be forced to pay a 30 percent higher premium each month in order to receive care. Make no mistake: these massive increases in healthcare costs dumped on the backs of American working families will only benefit the wealthiest few. The 400 richest families in America will see a tax break worth $7 million a year. That would make the GOP bill one of the largest transfers in wealth from low and middleincome families to the wealthiest in recent memory. This tax cut for the wealthy will also fall on the shoulders of seniors across America who will be forced to pay premiums five times higher than what younger individuals pay for health coverage. Not only is that cruel, but it is also unsustainable. According to the 2016 Medicare Trustees Report, the Medicare trust fund is solvent until 2028, 11 years longer than what was expected before the enactment of the Affordable Care Act reforms. In contrast, as the AARP noted, certain repeal provisions in the GOP bill could hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to 4 years and diminish Medicare’s ability to pay for services in the future. Millions of seniors depend on Medicare in conjunction with Medicaid to cover their longterm care needs, but Republicans’ plans to make America sick again would destroy Medicaid as we know it. At least 11 million Americans stand to lose their healthcare coverage with the passage of this bill. And if you are fortunate enough not to be one of those 11 million, well, then I hope you are not, either, one of the tens of millions of seniors with long term care needs, Americans with disabilities, pregnant women, children, or others who rely on Medicaid, because these drastic cuts and per capita caps are going to hurt them, too. TrumpCare’s assault on Medicaid will also disproportionately affect women. This is an unconscionable piece of legislation that must have the light of day shining on it and that must not be allowed to become law. Democrats will stand in the breach to make sure that Americans don’t get sick like they used to. 
CELEBRATING SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WOODALL ). The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, the month of March is when social workers throughout the country celebrate Social Work Month. I am here today to honor a special group of social workers who work in one of the most important institutions in our society: our schools. To honor the vital role school social workers serve in our communities, I am proud to introduce H.R. 171, to recognize the many contributions of school social workers and to designate this week, March 5 through 11, as School Social Work Week. School social workers are critical members of a school’s educational team. They strengthen partnerships between students’ homes, schools, and communities as they work to ensure student academic success. School social workers are uniquely trained and specially equipped to mentor students who face emotional, academic, and behavioral barriers to learning. Their expertise guides students through serious life challenges, including poverty, disability, sexual and physical abuse, addiction, bullying, and various forms of familial separation such as military deployment, divorce, 
and incarceration. We now understand how these adverse childhood experiences and chronic exposures to the stressors affect the developing brain, particularly in a school setting where the academic demands are high and the social pressures can be life changing. We must better support these students to overcome these barriers to success. We now have the science and research to inform our policies so that we are not just funneling these children out of a school system and into a prison system. We must prioritize the economic benefits of effective and preventive solutions and provide the necessary supports. School social workers provide these services in our schools by connecting students and families to available resources in the community, particularly in areas that have been hit hardest by poverty. School social workers improve the success rate of children coming from a disadvantaged background, lending a muchneeded hand in our efforts to create a more equal society. Families and communities want these services for their children. School districts should prioritize and invest in staffing models and programs that offer mental health services. Research tells us that individuals who suffer from mental illness will have developed these symptoms by age 14. The Centers for Disease Control finds that behavioral disorders are increasing in youth and presenting themselves at younger ages. Fewer than one in five of these children will ever receive needed mental health services. We also know that suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people ages 10 through 24. School mental health programs provided and enhanced by school social workers are critical to early identification of mental health problems. Research indicates that school mental health programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences, decreasing disciplinary referrals, and improving academic achievement. Our students deserve the support. Our students need school social workers to help them succeed. Unfortunately, there are often not enough school social workers available in school districts to meet the many, many needs of atrisk youth. The 1to 250 maximum recommended ratio of school social workers to students is exceeded in almost all school districts in the United States, with some experiencing ratios as high as 1 to 21,000. As we seek to improve our educational opportunities, maximizing the new opportunities and flexibility of the Every Student Achieves Act, let us use this week to recognize the contributions of school social workers and the vital role they play in helping our children reach their fullest potential. WHAT WE KNOW AND DON’T KNOW ABOUT THE GOP HEALTHCARE PLAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to share with my constituents what we know about the Republican healthcare plan and, more importantly, what we don’t know. We know that the Republican proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act will cut taxes for the wealthiest people in America. We know that it will eventually eliminate the Medicaid expansion, which is responsible for ensuring millions of Americans, including nearly 80,000 people in my district alone. We know that the GOP replacement plan shifts costs to seniors and lowincome families while restricting women’s access to reproductive health. We know that it is a windfall for the healthy and wealthy and a disaster for nearly everyone else. Now, this is what we know about the GOP healthcare plan, but perhaps more alarming is what we don’t know. My Republican colleagues cannot answer the two most important questions about their proposal: How much will it cost and how many people will it cover? Mr. Speaker, Congress should not take any further action on this bill without knowing its impact on the budget and its consequences for the American people. I am stunned—stunned—that my Republican colleagues are planning to move forward on a plan that is, quite literally, a matter of life and death for millions of American families without knowing exactly what they are moving forward with. Mr. Speaker, in 2009 and 2010 when Democrats held a televised healthcare summit with Republican leaders, when the Senate HELP Committee marked up the Affordable Care Act over a full month and accepted 160 Republican amendments, and when the Senate Finance Committee held 31 meetings over 60 hours, even after that process, Republicans said that Democrats rammed the healthcare bill through Congress without reading it. Now the Republican majority is moving forward with their replacement plan without knowing what it costs and what it will mean for American families. This level of hypocrisy and recklessness is insulting to the American people, and it is dangerous for the future of our healthcare system. There is already plenty to dislike about what we know is in this bill. Who knows what we will find out when we uncover the rest. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 10 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. POEof Texas) at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We ask Your blessing upon this assembly and upon all who call upon Your name. Send Your spirit to fill their hearts with those divine gifts You have prepared for them. May Your grace find expression in their compassion for the weak and the poor among us, and may Your mercy encourage good will in all they do and accomplish this day. As the Members of the people’s House face the demands of our time, grant them and us all Your peace and strength that we might act justly, love tenderly, and walk humbly with You. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, March 9, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on March 9, 2017, at 9:16 a.m.: That the Senate agreed to without amendment H.J. Res. 58. 
That the Senate agreed to S.J. Res. 1. That the Senate passed S. 496. With best wishes, I am Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, the Pell Grant Program is the backbone of all Federal student aid. These grants provide access and opportunity to thousands of students across the country. When I speak with North Country students and teachers in my district, I hear about the positive impacts of Pell grants. In my district, an average of 52 percent of students attending SUNY institutions are offered Pell grants. Today’s learners are different than previous generations, and their advancement toward completion is stifled by a Federal aid system built upon traditional spring and fall semesters. To support our students, I have introduced the Flexible Pell Grants for 21st Century Students Act, important legislation to expand access to Pell grants yearround. This change will allow students to accelerate toward completion and achieve their goals with less debt. We must do more to bring flexibility to higher education, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this important bill. 
HONORING TRUCKER DUKES (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, today let us honor and recognize a young Maui boy whose life touched hearts around the world and whose legacy will live on through the millions that he inspired. Trucker Dukes was not quite 4 years old when he took his last breath this past Friday after a painful battle with stage IV neuroblastoma and 2 years of intense treatment. Trucker’s dad is a firefighter, and like father, like son, Trucker loved fire trucks. When Trucker went to New York for treatment, the New York Fire Department coordinated a very special third birthday party celebration and swore him in as an honorary firefighter. After Trucker passed away, his parents, Shauna and Joshua, shared this message: ‘‘If there’s one thing I hope, it is that you love a little harder . . . a little better. Go home, stop the craziness in your life, and just kiss your loved ones more, tell them you love them more. None of us are promised tomorrow.’’ f 
RECOGNIZING THE BEST BUDDIES FRIENDSHIP WALK IN SOUTH FLORIDA (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, since its creation in 1989, Best Buddies has grown into a leading nonprofit entity that has provided countless opportunities for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Through its eight programs, participants are able to learn social skills, leadership development, integrated employment, and so much more. Today, Best Buddies has a presence in all 50 States and has spread internationally across many continents. I am also proud to say that the founder and the chairman of Best Buddies, Anthony Shriver, is a Floridian and a constituent. This Saturday, Best Buddies will be hosting its South Florida Friendship Walk which will take place at Museum Park, located in my congressional district, and I pray for a safe and successful event. I would like to express my tremendous appreciation to Best Buddies and the truly great people who support its cause. 
HONORING THE LATE CONGRESSMAN ENI FALEOMAVEGA (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, or CAPAC, I rise today to honor our former colleague, the Honorable Eni Faleomavega of American Samoa, who passed away last month. Eni was a true patriot, leader, and friend who dedicated his life to serving our country. His unwavering commitment to improving the lives of all Americans was integrally woven into the fabric of his distinguished military and public service career. As a founding member of CAPAC, he was also a strong champion for the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community across the country. Throughout his nearly three decades in Congress, he led notable efforts to secure critical funding for American Samoa and worked tirelessly to cultivate stronger U.S. relations throughout the AsiaPacific region. It was a privilege to work with Eni, and I will never forget his warmth and strong dedication to bettering our community and our country. I thank Eni for his lifetime of leadership and service and send my thoughts to his family during this difficult time. f 
FIXING OUR BROKEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM (Mr. FLEISCHMANN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because ObamaCare has failed the American people; and one of its biggest failures is that, instead of lowering costs, healthcare prices have increased. Americans are paying more for coverage, and families are hurting. In my State of Tennessee, premiums are rising by an average of 63 percent. Why pay so much for health insurance if you still can’t afford to see a doctor? It puts us right back where we started. And no one—no one—thought the status quo before ObamaCare was good enough. I am glad to see the American Health Care Act was released, and I look forward to working on specific legislative details with my colleagues so that we can finally fix our broken healthcare system. 
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concern with the proposal put forward by my Republican colleagues to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Most Americans want to increase access to health care, lower costs, and cover more Americans; but this bill, TrumpCare, will increase costs, limit access, and cover fewer Americans. This plan will cut Medicaid, which has helped literally tens of thousands of people in my State—in the Granite State—access health insurance for the first time. It has increased treatment and recovery services for those struggling with substance use disorder. We, like many States across this country, are grappling with a heroin epidemic. People are dying in my district from heroin overdoses and the fatal synthetic fentanyl. For the first time, they have access to health care. They have access to drug treatment. They have access to recovery services. And yet this bill will pull the rug out from underneath these Granite Staters and their families. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
AMERICANS HURT BY OBAMACARE (Mr. GIBBS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about Melanie, a constituent from Ohio’s Seventh Congressional District. 
Melanie and her husband are near retirement. Before ObamaCare, their monthly health insurance premiums were around $600. ObamaCare promised them reduced insurance premiums and increased access to care. But this promise to Melanie, like it was to millions of Americans, was broken. Melanie’s premium skyrocketed to nearly $1,000 a month for a plan with a $5,000 deductible. Her monthly premium is now more than their mortgage. When her husband was laid off, their options were limited: continuing coverage through COBRA or entering the ObamaCare marketplace. The ObamaCare plans were even more expensive. While Melanie’s husband was looking for work, they depleted their savings trying to maintain health insurance. Melanie is one of millions of Americans who have been hurt by ObamaCare. It has raised Melanie’s premiums and deductible, and when she needed an affordable option in an emergency, it wasn’t there. ObamaCare is collapsing. It is time to repeal it and provide relief to the millions of Americans suffering because of it. 
COASTAL EROSION (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, climate change is real; and it is so real that, before Donald Trump became President, he petitioned Ireland for a permit to build a seawall for one of his greatest golf courses in the world. His permit application said rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions from climate change threatened his property. As President, he seems to have changed his tune. In fact, a draft budget proposal from the administration zeros out investments in NOAA’S Coastal Zone Management Program, zero dollars for an initiative that provides critical resources to communities facing the same threat from rising sea levels as the President’s golf courses. You know, if it sounds like I am outraged about this, it is because I find this so outrageous. This is going to hurt people in coastal communities. I would like to invite the President to Taholah on the Quinault Indian Reservation. Tribal elders would tell him that the ocean that was once a football field away is now their front porch and creeps closer and closer every day. They would like a brandnew seawall, too. But, unfortunately, they aren’t billionaires. They need a partner in the Federal Government to protect their homes. So do folks in Ocean Shores and Westport and Neah Bay and coastal communities throughout my State. Before releasing his budget, I hope the President remembers that it is not just his golf course that is at risk. We are talking about people’s homes and people’s lives, and they deserve better than this. f 
OBAMACARE HURTING TEXAS FAMILIES (Mr. CARTER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is hurting Texas families, as the Speaker knows. The law has led to higher costs, fewer choices, and less access to the quality health care that is what the American people deserve. Currently, over 70 percent of the counties nationwide have two or fewer insurers. Texas could see as much as a 48 percent rate increase in 2017. This is proof that ObamaCare is failing. Hardworking Americans and their families have been begging for an end to the ObamaCare burden. It is up to this House to provide one. House Republicans have forged a new path to patientcentered health care. Our plan looks out for the most vulnerable and allows for Americans to choose a plan that best suits their healthcare needs. I am committed to repealing the broken promises of ObamaCare and replacing them with health care that works for Texas families. 
b1215 TRUMPCARE (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, this is day 49 of the Trump administration, which has been characterized by chaos, crisis, and confusion. Donald Trump promised to bring the jobs back, but the jobs bill must be in the witness protection program because, for the life of me, I can’t find it. Instead, we get TrumpCare, a bill that would destroy health care in America as we know it. TrumpCare will increase premiums on the American people. TrumpCare will increase copays on the American people. TrumpCare will increase deductibles on the American people. TrumpCare will increase the cost of prescription drugs on the American people. TrumpCare will reduce coverage for the American people. TrumpCare will be a disaster. And that is why House Democrats are going to do everything in our power to stop this reckless version of health care for America. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CHURUBUSCO HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a historic accomplishment that took place this past Saturday night in northeast Indiana. As you may know, in Indiana, we love basketball. We affectionately refer to our passion for the game as Hoosier Hysteria. This is a special time of the year for Hoosiers. Every year, high school teams across our State compete in the annual Indiana high school basketball tournament. For one team, this year turned into a special season. Churubusco High School, located in Whitley County, first competed in the Indiana boys high school tournament in 1981. Over the years, many great players wore the Eagles uniform, but Churubusco High School never won a sectional title until this year. This past Saturday night the Eagles claimed the Class 2A Woodlan Sectional, winning Churubusco’s first sectional championship trophy in the 99 year history of its boys basketball program. Eagle senior Luke Foote, who scored 26 points in the sectional championship game, said after the win: ‘‘It is huge for the community knowing that history was made. It means a lot to the guys that put on the jersey before us. . . . ‘’ I congratulate the Churubusco Eagles, head coach Chris Paul, and the entire Churubusco community on this historic accomplishment. The celebration of this sectional title is truly a century in the making. f 
REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, for 7 years, Republicans have been making promises about their secret healthcare plan. They said that under their plan, nobody would have to carry health insurance if they did not want to; and then when they got sick, they could demand their health insurance with no exclusions for preexisting conditions, no limits on coverage for expensive diseases, and that their coverage would be better and cheaper than ObamaCare for all Americans. While they made these questionable promises, the Affordable Care Act provided more than 20 million Americans with lifesaving health care. And now, after 7 years, Republicans have finally revealed their secret plan. We now see that virtually all their promises were lies. Their plan will rapidly bankrupt Medicare, and those over 50 will see massive cost increases, and millions will lose their health care. They did keep one promise, though. Massive new tax cuts for the wealthy. For that, millions of American families will pay a terrible price. 
REPUBLICAN RESCUE MISSION (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, as a physician, I know firsthand ObamaCare 
is in a death spiral. Now we are on a rescue mission. The President and our replacement bill repeals the ObamaCare mandates and taxes, but preserves three important protections: One, we don’t allow denying coverage or charging patients more with preexisting conditions. Two, we don’t allow insurers to charge women more for being women. Three, we allow children to stay on their parents’ plan until age 26. Going forward, we bend the cost curve downward by decentralizing health care, promoting competition, and expanding HSAs. We make health care more affordable by providing tax credits, creating value pools, and more judiciously redirecting Medicaid dollars back to those who need it most: children, elderly, and those with disabilities. 
BOB LEVINSON’S FAMILY DESERVES ANSWERS (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, today, March 9, marks 10 years since my constituent Bob Levinson disappeared in Iran. I had hoped that I would not have to come to the floor today to mark this day or to introduce another resolution on Bob. I had hoped that Bob would be home in south Florida with his wife, his seven children—one of whom is with us today—and his six grandchildren. Bob should be home in time to see his two new grandchildren born later this year. Ten years is too long. This family deserves answers. Iran must stop playing games, promising to assist finding Bob, agreeing last year to open a new dedicated channel for Bob’s case, only time and time again refusing to follow through. Iran must provide meaningful information that will bring Bob home. This new administration must press Iran at every opportunity. I stand ready to work with them and with anyone who is committed to bringing Bob back home to his family where he belongs. 
DRIVING DOWN HEALTHCARE COSTS (Mr. FERGUSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the American Health Care Act. For 25 years, I practiced dentistry in Georgia’s Third District, and I saw firsthand a healthcare system in need of reform to reduce costs and increase access to care. After ObamaCare was signed into law, these problems only got worse. I saw my patients, friends, and neighbors forced away from their doctors that they trusted. Instead of decreasing costs, patients saw their premiums skyrocket, their deductibles skyrocket, and their access to care limited. As a healthcare provider, I want to do what is best for my patients. I committed to them that I would come to Congress to repeal ObamaCare and undo the damage that it has done to our healthcare system. The legislation we are currently considering in the House, the American Health Care Act, is just the first step toward keeping that promise. By passing this legislation, we begin to move the ball down the field and gain yardage rather than continuing to lose ground. This is not our only play. It is the first step in beginning to drive down costs and increasing access to care for patients. This legislation will keep our promise to repeal ObamaCare and eliminate the government mandates that force people to purchase a product that they don’t want. It will allow patients the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions and drive down their costs. f 
REPEALING THE ACA HURTS MY DISTRICT (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you what repealing the Affordable Care Act means to Pennsylvania’s Second Congressional District: 369,000 people who receive health care from their employers could lose consumer protections; 335,000 people with health coverage that covers preventive care services could lose their coverage; 62,000 people covered by Medicaid expansion could lose their coverage; 21,000 people who receive financial assistance will be at greater risk of not being able to afford coverage. These are our mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and friends and neighbors. Philadelphia deserves a healthcare law that offers quality, affordable care. We must continue to speak up and speak out against the new healthcare law that hurts so many people in our city, our State, and our Nation. 
HONORING SARA WOODS (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women’s History Month, I recognize a dedicated public servant from Nebraska. Sara Woods’ contributions to our community as an educator, volunteer, and leader serve as a model for current and future generations across our Nation. Mrs. Woods has lived a life of service and inspiration impacting the community with her dedication. Throughout her educational career, she has encouraged her students to be engaged learners. Sara was crucial in the creation of many service organizations whose purpose is to equip, train, and encourage young leaders to serve their communities. She currently serves on the boards of several nonprofits in Omaha and works to improve conditions for youth, women, and the homeless. In recognition of her service, she received the University of Nebraska Omaha Chancellor’s Award in 2005 and the YWCA Women of Distinction award in 2009. Sara now oversees the operation of the Barbara Weitz Community Engagement Center. She was involved in the creation and development of this institute, which works to combine great ideas and organizations with the boundless energy of the University of Nebraska Omaha campus. Mrs. Woods has helped cultivate the same passion for service in others and fostered stronger bonds within our community and beyond. We would do well to adopt her inspiring passion for public service. f 
HONORING VAIL TOWN MANAGER STAN ZEMLER (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise before this body to recognize Mr. Stan Zemler of Vail, Colorado, who is leaving local government service after a career of over 30 years in our great State of Colorado. Mr. Zemler served as the town of Vail’s manager for the past 13 years. Before that, as the city of Boulder’s acting and deputy city manager, as the Boulder Urban Renewal Authority’s executive director, and as the CEO of the Boulder Chamber of Commerce, where I met Stan almost 20 years ago. What a terrific career with positive impacts on both Boulder County and Eagle County, two very important counties in my district. Stan’s leadership is about community partnering and consensus building. He really worked hard with various agencies, including Federal, State, local government, with the U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of Transportation to enhance Vail’s local community, international guest services and amenities, and strengthened its economic position as a sustainable international resort. He has been active in working with others in the I–70 Coalition and Colorado Association of Ski Towns. He has won numerous awards for his service. He will be missed in Eagle County for his service. We remember him fondly in Boulder County. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise to pay tribute to Stan Zemler on behalf of the residents of the Second Congressional District and myself personally. His distinguished service to the town of Vail and municipal government is an important legacy for many years to come. 
HEALTH INSURANCE IN NAME ONLY (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a few of my constituents who are struggling under the weight of ObamaCare. Like many Americans who are selfemployed, Kim and Randall are two Kansans who obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace. Kim’s premiums have more than doubled from $188 to $392 per month; but, worse, her deductible has actually gone from about $700 to $6,500. Randall’s premiums are even worse, coming in at around $700 per month, with a deductible of $6,800. I reference these two examples because they highlight one of the primary problems of the Affordable Care Act: coverage with deductibles approaching $7,000 really isn’t coverage at all. It is health insurance in name only. This week House Republicans have rolled out the initial draft of our plan to repeal and replace the ACA. We are doing it thoughtfully and carefully through the open committee process as we speak. The bill and summaries are available online at readthebill.gop. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is collapsing. Let’s work together as Democrats and Republicans to repair our broken healthcare system and truly give the American people access to affordable care. 
TRUMPCARE IS A DISASTER (Mr. TED LIEU of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose TrumpCare. This legislation is a ‘‘bigly’’ disaster. TrumpCare will cause Americans to pay more for less health insurance coverage. It doesn’t just affect the 20 million people who are now at threat of losing their health insurance. It affects all 156 million Americans under employerbased health coverage whose premiums will now increase because of the chaos that TrumpCare is causing in the health insurance markets. I agree with Republican Senator TOM COTTON about once every 3 years. This is one of those times. We both agree that TrumpCare is a disaster and that the House Republicans need to start over. 
b1230 CARING FOR OUR VETS (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud and so excited and so honored to be able to serve in the United States House of Representatives and to serve on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I did not serve in the military, but now I have the amazing blessing of serving those who did serve to protect our freedom to keep us safe. I am filing my first piece of legislation today, and it is the Veterans, Employees and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2017. In my first hearing as chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, I heard with great concern, and even outrage, that some employees at the VA spend 100 percent of their time on union activity. Even physicians and nurses and folks who are hired to provide health care to our veterans, 100 percent of their time on union activity. The law says their activity and time on union activities should be reasonable and in the best interest of the public. I don’t believe in west Texas, or any area around the country, that it is reasonable and in the best interest of the public to spend 100 percent of your time on union activity and not fulfilling the mission. And, in this case, it is protecting and serving and caring for our vets. f 
#RESISTREPEAL (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as we speak, 24 Members, Democrats, have been sitting with our Republican friends in Energy and Commerce for more than 24 hours, hunkered down on a bill that no one has seen, no one has read, or no one knows what it is about. Contrast that to the Affordable Care Act with over 79 hearings, over a 2year period, hundreds and hundreds of hours of hearings, 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, ongoing interaction with the American people. And what did we get? Over 20 million people, lower costs in Medicare, Medicaid, and employer coverage. What are we getting now in this document that is called a healthcare bill? Loss of coverage with 15 million Americans kicked off of health insurance, 73 million Americans may lose their health insurance, undermining employersponsored coverage that more than 177 million individuals would be jeopardized, no CBO assessment of what it is going to cost, how many jobs will be lost, and you will be paying more for your insurance and getting less. And the loved ones that you have in nursing homes that are dependent upon Medicaid, even though they worked, may be kicked out as we speak. Go forward on the D.C. 24 #ResistRepeal. 
CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES COMPEL US TO FIX HEALTH CARE (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind us of the need to repeal ObamaCare. We have an opportunity to address the Affordable Care Act. It is real simple: by gutting it. In northeast Georgia, I have heard again and again how my neighbors have suffered at the hands of ObamaCare. ObamaCare levied $1 trillion in new taxes, not including the de facto taxes that came to middle class Americans in the form of increased deductible and insurance premiums. The laws that our friends across the aisle forced on the American people while they worked in the shadows have crippled our healthcare system. The Affordable Care Act is not affordable, and it is not acceptable. Not from my neighbors and not for your loved ones, Mr. Speaker. Democrats created a brave new world in which coverage came with no promise of quality health care, in which insurance markets continue to crumble and families watch their healthcare resources slip way. The only way forward is to say good bye to ObamaCare, goodbye to personal and employer mandates. Good bye to additional and frivolous taxes. Goodbye to unnecessary spending. Goodbye to heartbreaking healthcare outcomes. Goodbye, and good riddance. f

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGHTER ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on House Resolution 180, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, and H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate for each bill, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit for both pieces of underlying legislation. Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from Judiciary Committee Chairman BOBGOODLATTE  and Congressman STEVE COHEN on behalf of the Judiciary Committee, as well as Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Ranking Member HANKJOHNSON . The Rules Committee made in order 12 amendments total—four amendments to H.R. 720 and eight amendments to H.R. 985, representing ideas from both sides of the aisle. I want to thank Chairman GOODLATTE and the Judiciary Committee staff for their work on both pieces of legislation. I am a member of the Judiciary Committee, and we had the opportunity to consider both pieces of legislation and enjoyed lively discussion at the markup for both bills. Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, we have worked tirelessly in this House to pass litigation reforms that would promote access to the courts for all Americans and ensure that the cost of litigation isn’t used as a tool to force settlements. We have also talked about how to restore reason and remove burdens on hardworking Americans. These bills help us achieve those goals. Both bills have enjoyed thorough discussion at both the committee level and on the floor, both in this Congress and in previous Congresses. H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, was introduced by my friend from Texas, Congressman LAMAR  SMITH. Similar legislation to H.R. 720 has passed the House before, and I look forward to its consideration again. This legislation provides a balanced solution to frivolous lawsuits, based on the simple principle that if an attorney files a baseless lawsuit that has no grounding in fact or law, the attorney should have to compensate the victim of their legal action. This legislation does not change the standard for rule 11 sanctions; it simply gives this important rule some teeth by making sanctions mandatory instead of discretionary. Opponents will argue that this bill will stifle robust examinations of existing law by discouraging otherwise meritorious lawsuits. To be certain, LARA does not change in any way the existing standards for determining what is and what is not a frivolous lawsuit, as determined under rule 11. In fact, LARA expressly provides that ‘‘nothing in’’ the changes made to rule 11 ‘‘shall be construed to bar or impede the assertion or development of new claims, defenses, or remedies under Federal, State, or local laws, including civil rights laws, or under the Constitution of the United States.’’ H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, was introduced by Chairman GOODLATTE . This legislation now also includes the Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency, or FACT, Act, authored by Congressman FARENTHOLD from Texas. H.R. 985 provides a targeted solution to a unique problem. At its core, the bill addresses whether the injury suffered by named plaintiffs in a class action suit accurately reflects injuries suffered by the class. Let me be clear, again, this bill does not kill the class action. Opponents would have you believe that it does, but these claims have become a knee jerk reaction to attempts to address clear abuses in the legal system. We want to make the system work for victims of these abuses and of other injustices. We want to make it more difficult for anyone to take advantage of the courts and make legal recourse more accessible for those who genuinely deserve relief. As a case in point, when Congress passed the Class Action Fairness Act, CAFA, in 2005, opponents claimed that its passage would mean the end of class action suits. Actually, it had two targeted goals: to reduce abusive forum shopping by plaintiffs and, in certain circumstances, to require greater Federal scrutiny procedures throughout the review of class action settlements. For example, you may remember an infamous Alabama class action involving Bank of Boston in which the attorneys’ fees exceeded the relief to the class members. As a result, class members lost money paying attorneys for their legal victory. Twelve years ago, opponents of CAFA made virtually identical arguments against that reform that they are making against H.R. 985 today. These objections are unsupported by history. In fact, researchers at the Federal Judicial Center conducted a study on the impact of CAFA and concluded that—postenactment—there was an increase in the number of class actions filed in or removed to the Federal courts based on diversity jurisdiction, consistent with the congressional intent behind that law. We see that necessary reforms have resulted in a class action option that is alive and well, representing an important part of our legal system. And it 
will remain that way. Claims to the contrary, Mr. Speaker, are just simply inaccurate. H.R. 985 is a targeted solution that says a Federal court may not certify a proposed class unless the party seeking the class action demonstrates through admissible evidentiary proof that each proposed class member suffered an injury of the same type and extent as the injury of the named class representative or representatives. This requirement also exists in rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Unfortunately, not all courts appropriately interpret or apply these standards. b1245 To claim that this bill, which codifies existing standards, would kill class action suits is just simply not supported by facts. Class actions exist for a reason, a reason vindicated both by compassion and by wisdom. The class action option exists to allow a group of individuals who have been similarly harmed to join together to seek appropriate compensation for their injuries. In today’s world, we see abuse after abuse of that legitimate purpose. As a result, we have seen the rise of a class of people who may bear legitimate injuries, but we also see countless others who have suffered no injury at all yet are vying for class action spoils to which they have no right. The noinjury class actions are designed to exploit companies to achieve a quick payday through accusations that are not grounded in genuine injuries. Class actions should be preserved as a tool for those who are harmed to plead their case and receive just compensation. H.R. 985 will allow courts to focus their resources on cases in which the people have actually suffered injuries. This helps ensure that we hold responsible parties accountable for their actions. As I mentioned, H.R. 985 also includes the Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency, or FACT, Act. The FACT Act is designed to reduce fraud and compensation claims for asbestos related diseases. This is a critical step to preserving resources for true victims because, unfortunately, doubledipping has become too common in asbestos claims. For every dollar awarded to fraudulent claims, there is $1 less available to true victims who are facing mesothelioma or other asbestosrelated illnesses. These victims are often those to whom our country owes its greatest debt: our veterans. Veterans currently comprise 9 percent of the population, yet they make up approximately 30 percent of the asbestos victims. Veterans are uniquely positioned to benefit from the increased transparency that this bill offers. Despite the positive impact that increased transparency can have for veterans, detractors claim that the legislation will negatively impact the privacy rights of claimants. Allow me to be clear, Mr. Speaker: this is not true. The bill actually requires far less personal information from claimants than State courts currently require in their disclosure documents. This legislation will reduce fraud in the asbestos trust system to safeguard assets in order to compensate future asbestos victims, veterans or otherwise. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 985 and H.R. 720 will establish meaningful reforms to our litigation system. I believe the United States is the greatest country in the world, and our justice system is designed to be free and fair, yet we have seen our justice system abused by people who seek ill gain at the expense of actual victims. These bills that today’s rule provides for help us to right that wrong. They may not be perfect, but they recognize existing flaws in the system and strive to fix those flaws to better serve the American public. With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleague and friend from Georgia for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, with this package of bills, the majority is taking a sledgehammer to civil litigation. I know that my colleague and I are not going to agree with that because I listened intently to what he had to say. But it is closing courthouse doors to ordinary people who are injured in the workplace and makes it harder for working people wronged by the rich and powerful to seek justice. First, H.R. 985 is really a solution in search of a problem. It uses the false notion of rampant fraud in the legal system to shield corporate wrongdoers and deny their victims relief. Second, H.R. 906 has the potential to further victimize asbestos victims. Third, H.R. 720 would roll back significant improvements to the Rules of Civil Procedure and repeat a failed experiment that led to a decade of problems in the courts. By requiring mandatory sanctions that tie judges’ hands, we saw an avalanche of unnecessary litigation. The majority is wasting time and taxpayer money to make changes that evidence and the experts tell us are not necessary and could actually cause more harm than good. It doesn’t make sense. But consider, Mr. Speaker, how the majority conducted itself on health care for a decade now. Almost immediately after President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, 13 Republican State attorneys general filed a Federal lawsuit opposing health reform. That was back in 2010. Since that time, the majority has voted over and over again—more than 60 times—to undermine the ACA. CBS News has highlighted that it costs the taxpayers an estimated $24 million a week to run the House of Representatives. Think how many millions of dollars of legislative time the majority wasted on these votes that never had any chance of becoming law under the previous President. They wasted taxpayers’ dollars and they wasted precious time. The majority spoke again and again about repeal and replace, and all the while, they didn’t have a thing in the world to replace the health care with. Former Speaker John Boehner recently made that clear, and it wasn’t until this week that the majority finally let Members of Congress and the American people see their latest effort—and it would be a catastrophe for families across the country. More and more groups and individuals are lining up against it. People would be forced to pay more for worse coverage if they could afford any coverage at all. The bill would also defund Planned Parenthood, which more than 2.5 million people, men and women, rely on for lifesaving preventive care, like cancer screenings and STI testing, every single year. It is truly astonishing that the majority is trying to rush through this bill without a Congressional Budget Office estimate about how much it would cost or what impact it would have on the insurance market. Let me quote from a Washington Post story this morning written by the great Karen Tumulty: 
While it is not uncommon for panels to consider legislation without the Congressional Budget Office first weighing in, veterans of the process say that doing so on bills as farreaching as the healthcare overhaul is rare and illadvised. 
We don’t have any idea how many people would gain or lose coverage without the CBO estimate, but we do know that this bill would take us back to the days before the Affordable Care Act when American people were on their own to try and get health care without any real safeguards in place at all; when families were liable to go bankrupt from heavy healthcare costs in a year’s time, and the ACA protects them from that by saying that once an insured person has spent $4,500 a year on health care, the insurance company will pay the rest, and for a family, $12,500 to insure them. That is something so rarely talked about that is in this bill that I think is of vast importance, and we would lose that. Billionaires would get a tax break, but working families probably couldn’t afford health care. We are rushing through this healthcare bill without a proper understanding of its cost or its impacts. The majority completely skipped the hearing process and, therefore, hasn’t heard from experts or doctors or people battling an illness—except, I guess, what is going on torturing people over in the Energy and Commerce Committee where they have been there since, what, over 24 hours now. So we were encouraged yesterday when we learned at the Rules Committee that White House Secretary 
Every Member of the House and the Senate will be able to have their opportunity to have amendments offered through the committee process and on the floor. 
It looks like we are not going to have that opportunity. And I do not have enthusiasm for the notion that we will have an open rule since, under this Speaker we have not had any, and the Democrats long to be able to offer some amendments to this bill. I certainly hope that that might be the case. Now, the only way that happens is through the open rule. As I said, we haven’t seen one of those in Speaker RYAN’s leadership. I hope the majority follows through with the White House’s promise of an open rule because, more than anything on this, the American people deserve an open and transparent process as this bill moves forward. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Sometimes it is often said that we discuss the issues that come to the floor, and there are real debates taking place across the street right now dealing with our discussions around health care. But I want to go back to actually the bills that we are dealing with in the rule and discuss the part of where do sometimes these issues come from, especially when we are discussing things like H.R. 985 and class act litigation. This came, actually, from outside the walls here and outside into the real world where this is being practiced. One of the things that is happening is that Federal judges have been looking to Congress to reform the class action system which currently allows lawyers to fill classes with hundreds of thousands of unmeritorious claims and use the artificially inflated classes to force defendants to settle the case. As the Supreme Court has recognized, ‘‘even a small chance of a devastating loss’’ inherent in most decisions to certify a class produces an ‘‘in terrorem’’ interim effect that often forces settlement independent of merits of the case. Mr. Speaker, I understand that fear because what we are dealing with many times in these class actions—and I know the Speaker and others are aware—is the definition of the class that really depends on the case itself, not as much of the merits of the case because of the potential of a devastating loss. So the actual class certification becomes something that is the main driver in these cases. Notice what Ruth Bader Ginsberg said about this. She recognized this when she said: ‘‘A court’s decision to certify a class . . . places pressure on the defendant to settle even unmeritorious claims.’’ That is pretty powerful from a Supreme Court Justice talking about these issues. Judge Diane Wood of the Seventh Circuit Court of appeals, appointed by President Clinton back in the day, has explained that class certification ‘‘is, in effect, the whole case.’’ ThenChief Judge of the Seventh Circuit Richard Posner explained that certification of a class action, even one lacking merit, forces defendants ‘‘to stake their companies on the outcome of a single jury trial, or be forced by fear of the risk of bankruptcy to settle even if they have no legal liability.’’ Mr. Speaker, listen to what these judges are saying. They are saying, number one, that the class certification is the most important thing because it depends on the outcomes and forces settlements. Notice what was said here by Supreme Court Justice Ginsberg, ‘‘unmeritorious claims.’’ Judge Diane Wood, Seventh Circuit, talked about it being ‘‘the whole case.’’ Judge Posner says that, in actuality, they are forced to settle ‘‘even if they have no legal liability.’’ In another Seventh Circuit Court decision, the court wrote: ‘‘One possible solution to this problem is requiring judges to do some threshold level of review of the merits of a class action before allowing certification, that is, approval of a class . . . It is cases like the one before us that demonstrate precisely why the courts, and Congress, ought to be on the lookout for ways to correct class action abuses. Given the complexity of our legal system, it is impossible to develop perfect standards for identifying and quickly disposing of frivolous claims. Inevitably this court and other courts will be faced with the cases that waste the time and money of everybody. Beyond addressing the legal claims before us as we would in any ordinary case, we must frankly identify situations where we suspect the lawyers, rather than the claimants, are the only potential beneficiaries.’’ Again, not coming in a vacuum, it is coming from the courts who see this on a regular basis, from Judge Ginsberg on down, saying: This is the whole deal. This is why we do these things. Mr. Speaker, this is something that does need to be taken up. It is something that we are proud to bring to the floor. In doing so, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would require a CBO cost estimate to be made publicly available for any legislation that amends or repeals the Affordable Care Act which may be considered in the Energy and Commerce or Ways and Means Committees or on the House floor. The Committees on Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce are marking up repeal legislation today. Legislation this significant should not advance through the committee process, let alone the House, without first hearing from our nonpartisan budget experts at CBO on what the cost and overall impact would be. Mr. Speaker, one of the most enduring symbols of fairness is Lady Justice, who is depicted holding the Scales of Justice that represent fairness in our courts. That central idea is embodied in the fact that justice in the United States of America is supposed to be delivered fairly, without any bias toward wealth or privilege. It is no secret that sometimes we do struggle to live up to that ideal. We have seen evidence of that far too often recently. But, Mr. Speaker, this Chamber shouldn’t be actively working to tilt those scales toward the rich and the powerful, but that is what this legislation would do. Considering these bills wastes their money and fritters away the time we should be spending addressing our crumbling infrastructure and the skyrocketing cost of education. And, Mr. Speaker, today we got from the American Society of Civil Engineers the new grades on our infrastructure. This year we get a D minus, and we should certainly do better than that. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment into the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky). Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1300 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I think what we are hearing today—and I think what we are going through in the process—is issues of real change, issues of discussions that have been going on in our country for really now almost 8 years. It has been 7 years since the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, was passed. We are seeing the changes that have taken place, Mr. Speaker, from your time here and my time here on really dealing with the American people and dealing with the substances of what their concerns and fears are. The things that I have come before this body and debated many times were what does the view look like from outside of this Chamber. Inside this Chamber, we have raucous debates. We have discussions on things. And at the end of the day, I believe sometimes, Mr. Speaker, those sitting at home say: Does anybody listen to me? Does anybody hear my call? Over the past few years, we have seen through election results and we have seen through times of change here in this body that the Affordable Care Act is nothing like affordable. In fact, as many have described it, it has been in a death spiral. We are beginning to work on that. 
Now, I understand how that can make the other side, the ones who gave us the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, not want to see that changed. I can appreciate that. Reality must set in at some point, and reality says that to defend something that is failing is asking for a status quo that hurts people. Now, I believe my friends across the aisle don’t want to do that, but that is what they are doing, holding onto a legacy that is only a legacy for many of heartbreak and problems. Did it help in some ways? Are we finding some? Did we address issues over the past few years and begin the discussion of preexisting conditions, keeping our children on until 26, and removing caps? Those were all discussed and could have been handled in many different ways besides the government takeover of health care. Instead, we chose to use an ideological position to begin the process of moving forward, and moving forward in which government will put its fingers on the scale and government will begin to say what is right and what is wrong. What we found in the whole process was our individual mark is destroyed. I have had some of my colleagues actually say: Let’s just start over and go back to the way it was. That would be nice, except that land doesn’t exist anymore. Even if you wanted to—and I don’t think we need to—we need to move forward with freemarket solutions that put access to affordable health care for all Americans on the table, so that we can actually bend the cost curve so that we can actually work to help people. That is what we are working on. We are going to continue to work on making a smooth transition from the disaster that many of us have seen over the past few years. When we do that, change will come, and change is hard. My folks back home are looking for change that helps, by Brittany Ivey, who joined me here for the joint session just a few weeks ago, who had employerbased health coverage with her family taken. She had to make choices about healthcare coverage and staying home. These choices make families’ decisions harder because they would rather make the decision to stay with family, but are having to work because health care became unaffordable. It is these kind of choices that we are laying out for the American people to listen and to say: What do we need to do and how do we need to go forward? So when we look ahead, we take issues of health care seriously. The gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGHTER ) is a friend. She states her position eloquently. It is always good to be on the floor with her. We disagree, and this is the place for this disagreement. This is a time in which we share; this is a time in which we come together. And what the Republican majority will do, Mr. Speaker, is keep its promises. Now, I have had a moment of sharing what we are doing in health care, but also let’s get back to why we are here, for the rule. The rule deals with abuses in the system; it deals with fairness. Mr. Speaker, today we are discussing reforms to our litigation system that increase fairness, balance, and transparency. These principles are part of our larger goals as House Republicans to create a system that works better for the American people and restores accountability to the system. We agree that there are legitimate lawsuits and legitimate class action suits. No one is arguing against that. In fact, I firmly believe that Americans should have access to a robust legal system that protects them. We encounter a problem, however, when frivolous lawsuits are lobbed against small businesses and employers in attempts to profit without warrant and at the expense of jobs. The bills provided for by the underlying rule help us address this challenge and to ensure that the litigation system functions as intended, rather than being manipulated to improperly target individuals or entities for profit. The rule itself provides for robust debate on the legislation and amendments from both sides of the aisle. I would encourage my colleagues to look favorably on these bills as a step toward reining in unnecessary and burdensome litigation and making the legal system work better to address true grievances and harms. Mr. Speaker, that last statement probably sums up what we need to be about here. Let’s look at the truth. Let’s help people. Let’s remember why we are here and, that is, those who sent us. The material previously referred to by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 180 O FFERED BY  MS. SLAUGHTER  At the end of the resolution, add the following new section: SEC. 3. In rule XXI add the following new clause: 13. (a) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or matter proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PL 111–148) and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111–152), or part thereof, in the House, in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, or in the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means, unless an easily searchable electronic estimate and comparison prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office is made available on a publicly available website of the House. (b) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order that waives the application of paragraph (a). 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has agreed to without amendment a joint resolution of the House of the following title: 
H.J. Res. 57. Joint Resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to accountability and State plans under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. f 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 725. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. EMMER ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 175 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 725. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JODYB. H ICE) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1455 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 725) to amend title 28, United States Code, to prevent fraudulent joinder, with Mr. JODYB. H ICEof Georgia in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans are some of the leading victims of frivolous lawsuits and the extraordinary costs that our legal system imposes. Every day, local businessowners routinely have lawsuits filed against them based on claims that have no substantive connection to them as a means of forum shopping on the part of the lawyers filing the case. These lawsuits present a tremendous burden on small businesses and their employees. The Innocent Party Protection Act, introduced by Judiciary Committee member Mr. BUCK of Colorado, will help reduce the litigation abuse that regularly drags small businesses into court for no other reason than as part of a lawyer’s forum shopping strategy. In order to avoid the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, plaintiffs’ attorneys regularly join instate defendants to the lawsuits they file in State court even if the instate defendants’ connections to the controversy are minimal or nonexistent. Typically the innocent but fraudulently joined instate defendant is a small business or the owner or employee of a small business. Even though these innocent instate defendants ultimately don’t face any liability as a result of being named as a defendant, they, nevertheless, have to spend money to hire a lawyer and take valuable time away from running their businesses or spending time with their families to deal with matters related to a lawsuit to which they have no real connection. To take just a few examples, in Bendy v. C.B. Fleet Company, the plaintiff brought a product liability claim against a national company for its allegedly defective medicinal drink. The plaintiff also joined a resident local defendant health clinic alleging it negligently instructed the plaintiff to ingest the drink. The national company removed the case to Federal court and argued that 
the small, local defendant was fraudulently joined because the plaintiff’s claims against the clinic were time barred by the statute of limitations, showing no possibility of recovery. Despite finding the possibility of relief against the local defendant ‘‘remote,’’ the court remanded the case after emphasizing the draconian burden on the national company to show fraudulent joinder under the current rules. The court practically apologized publicly to the joined party stating: ‘‘The fact that Maryland courts are likely to dismiss Bendy’s claims against the local defendant is not sufficient for jurisdiction, given the Fourth Circuit’s strict standard for fraudulent joinder.’’ Shortly after remand, all claims against the local defendant were dismissed, of course, after its presence in the lawsuit served the trial lawyers’ tactical purpose of forum shopping. When courts themselves complain about the unfairness of current court rules, Congress should take notice. In Baumeister v. Home Depot, Home Depot removed a slipandfall case to Federal court. The day after removal and before conducting any discovery, the plaintiff amended the complaint to name a local business, which it alleged failed to maintain the store’s parking lot. The court found the timing of the amended complaint was ‘‘suspect,’’ noting the possibility that the sole reason for amending the complaint to add the local defendant as a defendant could have been to defeat diversity jurisdiction. b1500 Nevertheless, the court held Home Depot had not met its ‘‘heavy burden’’ of showing fraudulent joinder under current law because the court found it was possible, even if it were just a tenth of a percent possible, that the newly added defendant could potentially be held liable and remanded the case back to State court. Once back in State court, the plaintiff stipulated to dismiss the innocent local defendant from the lawsuit, but only after it had been used successfully as a forumshopping pawn. Trial lawyers join these unconnected instate defendants to their lawsuits because today a case can be kept in State court by simply joining as a defendant a local party that shares the same local residence as the person bringing the lawsuit. When the primary defendant moves to remove the case to Federal court, the addition of that local defendant will generally defeat removal under a variety of approaches judges currently take to determine whether the joined defendant prevents removal to Federal court. One approach judges take is to require a showing that there is ‘‘no possibility of recovery’’ against the local defendant before a case can be removed to Federal court or some practically equivalent standard. Others require the judge to resolve any doubts regarding removal in favor of the person bringing the lawsuit. Still others require the judge to find that the local defendant was added in bad faith before they allow the case to be removed to Federal court. The current law is so unfairly heavy handed against innocent local parties joined to lawsuits that Federal Appeals Court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has publicly supported congressional action to change the standards for joinder, saying: ‘‘That’s exactly the kind of approach to Federal jurisdiction reform I like because it’s targeted. And there is a problem with fraudulent jurisdiction law as it exists today, I think, and that is that you have to establish that the joinder of a nondiverse defendant is totally ridiculous and that there is no possibility of ever recovering . . . that’s very hard to do,’’ he says. ‘‘So I think making the fraudulent joinder law a little bit more realistic . . . appeals to me because it seems to me the kind of intermediate step that addresses real problems.’’ The bill before us today addresses those real problems in two main ways: First, the bill allows judges greater discretion to free an innocent local party from a case where the judge finds there is no plausible case against that party. That plausibility standard is the same standard the Supreme Court has said should be used to dismiss pleadings for failing to state a valid legal claim, and the same standard should apply to release innocent parties from lawsuits. Second, the bill allows judges to look at evidence that the trial lawyers aren’t acting in good faith in adding local defendants. This is a standard some lower courts already use to determine whether a trial lawyer really intends to pursue claims against the local defendant or is just using them as part of their forumshopping strategy. This bill is strongly supported by the National Federation of Independent Business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among other legal reform advocates. Please join me in supporting this vital legislation to reduce litigation abuse and forum shopping and to protect innocent parties from costly, extended, and unnecessary litigation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, we have seen a number of bills this session which are designed to shut the door on victims of corporate misfeasance and negligence and to nail the door shut. H.R. 725 is part of this wave of legislation. Like most other bills we have seen this session with brazenly Orwellian titles, the socalled Innocent Party Protection Act of 2017 has nothing to do with protecting innocent parties. Rather, it is just the latest attempt to tilt the civil justice system dramatically in favor of big corporate defendants by making it much more difficult for plaintiffs to pursue State law claims in State courts under the system of federalism designed by our Founders. Again, this is a familiar experience because the bill addresses a completely nonexistent problem. If there had been a real problem, the Judiciary Committee might have held a hearing in which we could have invited groups to come forward who support tort victims. They could have come and testified about why it was so important for the interests of civil justice for us to pass this legislation. But there was no hearing at all. We didn’t hear any witnesses, much less the testimony of those groups that represent victims of mass toxic torts, asbestos poisoning, lead poisoning, sex discrimination lawsuits—none of it. In fact, the groups that we would have called, if we were interested in the testimony of victims and people seeking civil justice, oppose this legislation overwhelmingly: the Alliance for Justice opposes it; the Center for Justice and Democracy opposes it; the Consumer Federation of America opposes it; the National Association of Consumer Advocates opposes it; the National Consumer Law Center opposes it; the Natural Resources Defense Council opposes it; Public Citizen opposes it; the Sierra Club opposes it. Under current law, a defendant may remove a case, alleging State law claims, to a Federal court only if there is complete diversity of citizenship between all plaintiffs and all defendants. If the plaintiff adds an instate defendant to the case solely for the purpose of defeating jurisdiction, this constitutes fraudulent joinder today; and in such circumstances, the case may be removed directly to Federal court. In determining whether a joinder was fraudulent, the court considers only whether there was any basis for a claim against the nondiverse defendant. The defendant must show that there was no possibility of recovery or no reasonable basis for adding the nondiverse defendant to the suit. This very high standard has guided our Federal courts for more than a century and it has functioned well, and the bill’s proponents offer no objective evidence to the contrary. And again, we have had no hearing. For a new Member of Congress like me, who comes from the Maryland State Senate, I am absolutely astonished and amazed that we would think of overturning a standard fixture in our civil justice system without so much as a hearing as to what the problem is. H.R. 725 would replace a timehonored standard with an ambiguous one that would dramatically increase the costs and burdens of litigation on plaintiffs in Federal courts. It would try to strip our State courts of their basic powers to hear cases relating to their citizens. This is an assault on federalism. The measure would require a court to deny a motion remanding to the State 
courts unless the court finds, one, that it is ‘‘plausible to conclude that applicable State law would impose liability’’ on an instate defendant; two, that the plaintiff had a ‘‘good faith intention to prosecute the action against each’’ instate defendant or to seek a joint judgment; and three, that there was no ‘‘actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts.’’ This gauntlet of hurdles suddenly shifts the burden and creates a presumption that a Federal court should hear the case, making it far more expensive and difficult for plaintiffs to have their cases heard in State court. H.R. 725 would effectively overturn the local defendant exception, which prohibits removal to Federal court even if complete diversity of citizenship exists when the defendant is a citizen of the State where the suit was filed. The bill’s radical changes to longstanding jurisdictional practice reveal the authentic purpose behind the measure. It is simply intended to stifle the ability of plaintiffs to have their choice of forum and, possibly, even their day in court. In addition, H.R. 725 would sharply increase the cost of litigation for plaintiffs and further burden the Federal court system. For example, the meanings of terms like ‘‘plausible’’ and ‘‘good faith intention’’ are ambiguous and will spawn substantial litigation over their proper interpretation and application, further postponing decisions and justice. Additionally, these standards would require a court to engage in a mini trial during the early procedural stages of the case without any opportunity for the full development of evidence. Again, this would sharply increase the burdens and costs of litigation for ordinary citizens, for plaintiffs, which appears to be, to my mind, the only possible contemplated result of this legislation. Finally, we need to focus on the fact that this bill offered by the majority raises profound federalism concerns, which I would have hoped they would be attentive to. Matters of State law should be decided by State courts, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the Constitution. It was our constitutional design that matters of civil dispute and conflict go to State courts, State judges, and State juries, all of them closer to the people themselves, unless you have a Federal question, a matter of Federal statutory law, a matter of Federal constitutional law, or you have got diversity jurisdiction. H.R. 725 bulldozes this key federalism constraint and casts a shadow, unnecessarily and improperly, over State courts, the courts of the people. By applying sweeping and vaguely worded new standards to the determination of when a State case must be remanded to State court, the bill denies State courts the ability to decide and, ultimately, to shape the unfolding of State law. This is completely contrary to the design of the Founders, many of them Virginians, like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and George Mason, who wanted the State courts to be the central arena for the resolution of civil conflicts and tort disputes. Simply put, H.R. 725 tramples State sovereignty and our basic constitutional structure. For these reasons and for the fact that nobody has demonstrated there is a real problem, I urge the House to resist this unnecessary and flawed legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Since this bill was marked up in the last Congress, the very same plausibility standard used in this bill was adopted by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in which fraudulent joinder cases arise with the greatest frequency. Last Congress, Ranking Member CONYERS said of the bill, it should simply pick one of the existing articulations in the fraudulent joinder standard and codify that into law. At the time, the plausibility approach was applied by some district courts, but just last year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the same plausibility standard this bill contains in a case called International Energy. The Fifth Circuit stated: We must consider whether the plaintiff pleaded ‘‘enough facts to state a claim to relieve that is plausible on its face.’’ The plaintiff in that case petitioned for rehearing en banc, but the rehearing was denied, with not a single judge on the Fifth Circuit requesting a vote. In just the last year, district courts in the Fifth Circuit have issued more than 40 fraudulent joinder decisions without much difficulty and with the results that indicate just the sort of reasonable reform that would occur nationwide when we get this bill passed into law. So this is about making the system work and opening the door to the Federal courts so companies from foreign states are not unfairly, potentially disadvantaged. The other piece of this that is easy to neglect is the local defendant. I don’t know if the gentleman across the aisle has ever been sued. I have friends who have been sued. It is an emotionally and financially devastating procedure. You have got to take time off from your life and business to defend it. You have got to hire a lawyer, which is incredibly expensive. This is to protect the innocent third parties and open the doors to the Federal courts and just make it fairer and easier. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I very much appreciate my colleague’s remarks there. I want to make one point before I yield to my distinguished colleague from New York. Mr. Chairman, my colleague asked us to reckon with the fact that it is emotionally devastating for people to be sued, and, undoubtedly, it is in certain cases. But compare whatever it might feel like to be sued in whatever case he might have in mind with the outrageous emotional devastation caused by asbestos poisoning, by lead poisoning, by mass sexual harassment, sex discrimination, race discrimination, all of the torts that come to dominate what takes place in our courts. So if we are going to have a new emotional devastation standard, I would put the plaintiffs up against the large corporate defendants any day. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague from New York (Mr. NADLER ). Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 725, the misnamed Innocent Party Protection Act. The main purpose of this bill is to make it easier to remove State cases to Federal courts, where large corporate defendants have numerous advantages over consumers and injured workers. b1515 Let’s not talk about the emotional devastation. We are talking about large, corporate defendants. We are not worried about their emotions. Their litigation departments are quite capable of handling the emotions. This bill will clog the Federal courts, drain judicial resources, upset wellestablished law, and delay justice for plaintiffs seeking to hold businesses accountable for the injuries they cause. It is yet another attempt by the Republican majority to stack the deck in favor of large corporations. This bill is the opening salvo of this week’s series of bills by the Republicans to close off access to the courts to ordinary Americans. With every step they take, whether it be to remove more State cases to Federal courts, to make class action suits more difficult to bring, or to reclassify more lawsuits as frivolous and subject to mandatory sanctions, they are limiting access to court help for ordinary Americans. The socalled Innocent Party Protection Act would upend the centuryold doctrine of fraudulent joinder, in which a defendant from the same State as the plaintiff is improperly added to a case in order to defeat diversity jurisdiction in Federal court, and, therefore, keep the case in a State court. Under current law, a defendant claiming fraudulent rejoinder has the burden of showing that there is ‘‘no reasonable basis’’ for a claim against the instate defendant, and, therefore, the case should remain in Federal court. This bill would turn that process on its head by placing the burden on the plaintiff to show that there is a ‘‘plausible’’ claim against the instate defendant and that the plaintiff has a ‘‘good faith intention’’ to pursue a claim against that defendant. Both standards are undefined in the bill, but it is likely that many plaintiffs would find these hurdles impossible to overcome at the initial stages of litigation before discovery. 
Furthermore, defendants will use this forum shopping bill to delay justice by routinely challenging jurisdiction. It will drain court time and allow corporate defendants to force plaintiffs to expend their limited resources on what should be a simple procedural matter. Under this bill, the preliminary determination of jurisdiction would become a baseless, timeconsuming minitrial before a second timeconsuming trial on the merits. While large corporations could easily accommodate such costs, injured workers, consumers, and patients cannot. The practical effect of this bill is to force cases based on State law, which should properly be heard in State courts, to be considered in our overburdened Federal courts instead. Large corporations generally believe that Federal courts are a friendlier forum, especially since they are overburdened and they can afford to wait whereas the plaintiffs cannot, and they believe that they have a better chance of escaping liability for their actions in the Federal court. There is no evidence of a systemic crisis of fraudulent joinder, nor is there evidence that the courts cannot properly handle whatever issues may arise under current law. There is certainly no evidence that what wealthy corporations need are greater advantages in the courts. Yet, this bill hands them yet another gift from the Republican majority, and it is ordinary consumers and injured workers who will suffer. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this legislation. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this bill is not about protecting big corporations. This bill is about protecting the smallbusiness owner or the employee who is fraudulently joined into a case who has to go out and hire his or her own lawyer. I remember something my law school professor once told me back in the day at St. Mary’s University School of Law in San Antonio, Texas, and it stuck in my mind ever since: When you get sued, you may be able to beat the rap, but you can’t beat the ride. It is expensive, it is emotionally draining, and it is time consuming. I have no problem at all, and this bill is not designed to protect corporations. It is designed to protect, just as its name states, innocent parties. These are people who are joined solely to defeat diversity jurisdiction. We are just changing the standard slightly to one adopted by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to make it much more fair to these innocent parties. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ). Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding me the time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 725, the socalled Innocent Party Protection Act of 2017. This cynically misnamed bill is a Republican Party effort to coddle and protect their corporate wrongdoing supporters by making it harder for injured victims to sue the corporation in State court. A more accurate name for the Innocent Party Protection Act actually would be the Corporate Wrongdoer Protection Act. Make no mistake about it, Mr. Chairman, this bill is my Republican friends’ attempt to—it is clear whom they are working for. They refer to corporate wrongdoers as innocent parties. If some day you or your loved one are injured or harmed due to the negligence or intentional act of others, you have the option to sue in State or Federal court based on the residence of the wrongdoers. However, if your case should be removed to Federal court upon a motion by one of the defendants, as a plaintiff, there are grounds upon which you could have the case remanded back to the State court. Republicans want to call this fraudulent joinder. However, a decision to sue all of the wrongdoers in your State court is not fraud. Instead, it is a legal practice dating back over 100 years which provides balance and prevents more powerful interests from choosing which court the case can be heard. They want to stack the deck. For example, if it was your grandmother who was physically neglected or sexually assaulted at a nursing home, you would not only seek criminal charges against the wrongdoer, but you would want to file a lawsuit against both the individual attacker and the company that negligently hired, trained, or failed to adequately supervise the perpetrator under their employ. By the way, it is becoming increasingly common for nursing homes to be owned by large conglomerates or out ofState hedge funds. Under current law, you have the right to sue in State court, but rather than going all the way to Federal court in the State the corporation is based, you have the option to stay near your home in State court. H.R. 725 would do away with that option by giving the corporate wrongdoer the ability to keep the case in Federal court, thus unfairly increasing the burden on innocent victims and making it less likely for the smaller party to sue in the first place. Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, in the gentleman from Georgia’s example, this bill wouldn’t apply at all. If my grandmother were assaulted in a nursing home, I would certainly sue the nursing home company. I would also join the person who actually did it who most likely definitely will be a resident of the State that the lawsuit was going in. There would clearly be a plausible cause of action against that tortfeasor. Mr. Chairman, I didn’t practice personal injury law. I was an agriculture lawyer. But this would be an easy case for me to prove in his example. We are not trying to protect anybody who has done something wrong. We are trying to protect people who are joined into a lawsuit solely for the purpose of forum shopping. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I think that we are actually progressing in our discussion of the issue because we presently have a law against fraudulent joinder. They simply want to make it far more difficult for plaintiffs to get justice in State courts. The law already makes it impossible to fraudulently join someone. So in the case offered by the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, I could very much see an outofState corporate behemoth that owns nursing homes across the country saying that all of this should be in Federal court because the person who actually committed the sexual assault instate is judgmentproof because they don’t have any money and that is not really a plausible opportunity to recover, and, therefore, it should stay in Federal court. The grand irony here, Mr. Chairman, is that the party which sings lullabies about federalism and states’ rights is in the business of stripping our State courts and our people of the opportunity to get into State court. All of this is about forcing everybody into Federal court. I remember a President who recently said in his inaugural address that the whole sum and substance of his administration is to give power back to the States and back to the people, but this legislation is designed to wreck federalism and to force everybody into Federal court where the big corporate defendants and the fancy lawyers have every conceivable advantage over people who are just trying to get justice when they have been injured in their State. Mr. Chairman, the substantive issues at stake here are obviously complex, and I would invite all Americans to try to research what is going on. But if you don’t have the time to actually study the more than a century in which we have had current fraudulent joinder rules and you don’t have time to go and examine the bill as submitted by the majority, then just consider the procedure that has gotten us to this point. There has been no hearing on this bill, there has been no call for this bill by anybody who has been injured in a civil tort case, and all of the groups that try to stand up for citizens against the largest corporations who are bankrolled by billions of dollars and are trying to force everybody these days into arbitration and to shut the courthouse door, all of those groups are opposed to the legislation because they understand what it is going to do. It is going to make it far more difficult for people to prosecute civil 
claims when they have been injured in something like a sexual harassment case, a sexual violence case, a discrimination case, an asbestos poisoning case, or a mass toxic tort. It is going to be far more difficult for people to get justice in their State courts. Apparently, the interests of the large corporate polluters and inflictors of injuries—tortfeasors—are so important that we are willing to trample the basic principles of our constitutional design which is that these kinds of cases go into State court for State resolution, we reserve the Federal courts for complicated questions of Federal law and real cases of diversity jurisdiction, not phony cases of diversity jurisdiction where they try to eliminate the instate defendant, but real cases of diversity jurisdiction where nobody else is involved. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, this really is about trying to stop bringing phony cases in. You are bringing phony defendants in, and that is what we are trying to stop. We have got to be fair about this. It is not often that we have the opportunity to protect innocent local folks and businesses from costly and meritless lawsuits. This is an opportunity to rein in forum shopping and abuses by trial lawyers and hold them to a good faith standard in litigation. We can do that by passing a bill that is just a few pages long. That is the opportunity we have today. All this bill does—all this bill does— is say that innocent, local parties— mostly small businesses—can’t be added to a lawsuit for forum shopping purposes, and it only prohibits this when there is no plausible case against these small businesses or the case against them isn’t brought in good faith. Who could argue with that? Mr. Chairman, for that reason, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. SIMPSON ). All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule, and shall be considered as read. The text of the bill is as follow: 
H.R. 725 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Innocent Party Protection Act’’. 
Section 1447 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(f) FRAUDULENT JOINDER .— ‘‘(1) This subsection shall apply to any case in which— ‘‘(A) a civil action is removed solely on the basis of the jurisdiction conferred by section 1332(a); ‘‘(B) a motion to remand is made on the ground that— ‘‘(i) one or more defendants are citizens of the same State as one or more plaintiffs; or ‘‘(ii) one or more defendants properly joined and served are citizens of the State in which the action was brought; and ‘‘(C) the motion is opposed on the ground that the joinder of the defendant or defendants described in subparagraph (B) is fraudulent. ‘‘(2) The joinder of a defendant described in paragraph (1)(B) is fraudulent if the court finds that— ‘‘(A) there is actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts with respect to that defendant; ‘‘(B) based on the complaint and the materials submitted under paragraph (3), it is not plausible to conclude that applicable State law would impose liability on that defendant; ‘‘(C) State or Federal law clearly bars all claims in the complaint against that defendant; or ‘‘(D) objective evidence clearly demonstrates that there is no good faith intention to prosecute the action against that defendant or to seek a joint judgment including that defendant. ‘‘(3) In determining whether to grant or deny a motion under paragraph (1)(B), the court may permit the pleadings to be amended, and shall consider the pleadings, affidavits, and other evidence submitted by the parties. ‘‘(4) If the court finds that all defendants described in paragraph (1)(B) have been fraudulently joined under paragraph (2), it shall dismiss without prejudice the claims against those defendants and shall deny the motion described in paragraph (1)(B).’’. The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed in House Report 115–27. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . SOTO 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 115–27. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 3, line 10, strike ‘‘This’’ and insert ‘‘Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, this’’. Page 5, line 4, strike the close quotation mark and the period which follows. Page 5, after line 4, insert the following: ‘‘(5) This subsection does not apply with respect to a case in which the plaintiff seeks compensation for public health risks, including byproducts of hydraulic fracturing, well stimulation, or any water contamination.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 175, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would create an exception to this bill for instances of public health risks, including byproducts of hydraulic fracturing, well stimulation, or any water contamination. Fracking, especially in my home State of Florida, is dangerous, and its effects can be farreaching. Just last week, a State senate committee voted unanimously to ban the practice in our State, and the bill continues to move through. Pollution can reach our aquifers that provide drinking water to millions. Sometimes concerned citizens must go to court to stop this. Access to justice is a fundamental American right, and we must protect it. Sometimes in Washington, up is down and right is wrong. This, unfortunately, is the case with the socalled Innocent Party Protection Act. b1530 This bill is incredibly harmful to those injured by corporate wrongdoers. If someone drinks poisoned water as a result of fracking, well stimulation, or general water contamination, this bill will make it harder for them to get justice for their injuries. By restricting access to State courts, the courts that are closest to the people, this bill would deny justice. The bill will deny plaintiffs their right to choose a State court forum for their claims and will instead allow defendant companies that negligently pollute water to drag a case out, which will drive up costs and increase burdens for plaintiffs by removing it to Federal court. Then, once a case is in Federal court, instead of litigating over the merits of the case, the courts will argue over the various requirements that this bill establishes. Placing a higher threshold that a plaintiff must satisfy to get the case sent back to State court is unnecessary and unduly burdensome. The amendment I am offering would restore access to justice. It would allow people whose water has been contaminated by fracking and related activities to seek damages from corporate wrongdoers. This amendment isn’t just a hypothetical exercise. Here in my hand I hold 18 cases involving fracking. They are 18 cases where fracking led to injury. In 10 of these cases, plaintiffs sued in State court, raising State claims, yet defendants removed the case to Federal court, only to have the Federal court remand the cases back to the State due to lack of diversity jurisdiction. Thus, I hold here 10 cases where a remand back to State court would be denied under this bill. If this bill had been enacted, I hold here 10 cases that would have been denied justice. Four of these 18 hydraulic fracturing cases are still pending. Will we deny justice for these four cases? For these plaintiffs and for future plaintiffs, I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment and safeguard justice to all who drink water. Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be roundly opposed for the simple reason it doesn’t protect any victims, but it also victimizes local parties in the types of cases covered by the amendment. The purpose of the underlying bill is to allow judges greater discretion to free innocent local parties—that is, innocent people and innocent small businesses—from lawsuits when those innocent local parties are dragged into a case solely because a plaintiff’s attorney wants to do some forum shopping. These innocent local parties have, at most, an attenuated connection to the claims made by the trial lawyer against some national company a thousand miles away. These innocent local parties shouldn’t have to suffer the time, expense, and emotional drain of a lawsuit when the plaintiff can’t even come up with a plausible claim. The base bill protects these innocent local parties from being dragged into a lawsuit as a party just to keep the case in State court. Now, let’s bring in this amendment, which denies the bill’s protection to innocent local parties adjoined to a lawsuit simply because the legal allegations in the case fall into one arbitrary category and that one is in another. It is terribly unfair. This amendment would allow these things to happen to innocent people in the name of allowing trial lawyers to scuttle the hydraulic fracking industry through lawsuits. Innocent people are innocent people, and they should be protected against being dragged into lawsuits regardless of the nature of the case. This doesn’t deny anybody access to the courts. It protects innocent parties from being dragged into a case for forum shopping. Every single one of the gentleman’s cases will be heard in court. They will have their day in court and they will have justice based on the facts. This bill does not protect wrongdoing corporations. This bill protects people who are dragged into a lawsuit strictly for procedural purposes. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, water is not arbitrary. The right to clean water is not arbitrary. It is essential. Just ask the plaintiffs in these cases. Just ask the people of Flint. Just ask victims of fracking across our Nation, which is why we in Florida are looking to ban the practice. So this isn’t just some arbitrary area. This is an essential area that is affecting issues right now throughout the Nation. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, the Soto amendment is an excellent amendment and I can’t see why anybody would oppose it. I can’t see, in the first instance, why anyone would want to keep the people’s cases out of the people’s courts in their own States. It seems as if there is a move somewhere in this Congress that is so intent on protecting polluters and the manufacturers of auto defects that they are willing to trample our basic principles of federalism and invade the proper province of the courts. The Soto amendment would exempt from this bill all cases in which the plaintiff seeks compensation for public health risks like fracking or any other kind of water contamination. Water contamination is devastating to our communities regardless of the source, as demonstrated by the ongoing Flint water crisis in Michigan. This bill makes it easier for large corporations to remove State law claims to Federal court, where they think they have got a better chance of beating the claims of the small guy. The Soto amendment at least would carve out cases where there are public health risks at stake, such as those caused by fracking, which has been proven to generate earthquakes, well contamination, and the poisoning of local water supplies. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I am not going to get sucked into a debate of hydraulic fracking. Being from Texas, we might have a whole difference of opinion on that. But I do want to point out, with respect to this bill, it doesn’t deny anyone access to courts, it doesn’t deny anyone access to justice regardless of what claim. I don’t think it is fair we take out one particular claim or not one particular claim. That seems to go against fundamental fairness as well. This bill is all about fairness. It is about fairness to keep people from being dragged into court solely because a plaintiff’s attorney needs a local defendant to avoid diversity jurisdiction. I oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and support the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 115–27. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 5, line 4, strike the close quotation mark and the period which follows. Page 5, after line 4, insert the following: ‘‘(5) This subsection shall not apply to a case in which the plaintiff seeks compensation resulting from the bad faith of an insurer.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 175, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I also oppose this underlying bill, which is why I call it, as others have, the wrongdoer protection act for multistate and multinational corporations, and for that purpose, I add this amendment. It is no coincidence that these corporate wrongdoers want to force consumers to fight them in Federal court. That is the effect of this bill, to enlarge Federal court diversity jurisdiction. It is no coincidence that the corporate wrongdoers want to fight in Federal court. It is not because they think the Federal judges are better looking or the Federal judges are more polite or the decor in the Federal courtrooms is nicer to look at. That is not it all. They want to go there because they are more likely to prevail and to beat consumers in Federal court. They know that. They know that, after a generation of regrettable decisions across the street by the Supreme Court of the United States, Federal court has become very favorable turf for corporate wrongdoers—generations of bad decisions that invite and exhort Federal judges to forget about the Seventh Amendment in our Bill of Rights. You remember the Seventh Amendment. It was written by James Madison. It was announced as approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, whose statue stands right outside this Chamber. It was an amendment that says very simply: ‘‘ . . . in suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. . . . ‘’ There is nothing ambiguous about that statement. It is not hard to understand. It is about how important the right to trial by jury is to us here in these United States. But since the 1980s, there has been this steady drumbeat of decisions from the United States Supreme Court encouraging and emboldening Federal court judges to decide and dismiss cases without the trouble of a jury trial. Their toolkit is enormous for doing that: motions to dismiss, motions for judgment on the pleadings, motions for summary judgment, motions for directed verdict, motions for judgment as a matter of law. 
Cases do get thrown out every day in this country without the trouble of a jury trial, and the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial is not preserved. That is why wrongdoer corporations prefer to be in the Federal court. Federal court has become candy land for corporate wrongdoers in this country, and this bill helps them stay there and fight consumers in Federal court. It changes the law to allow corporate wrongdoers to do that. I want to give you some very strong reasons, Mr. Chairman, why this bill is so bad. Number one, it is discriminatory. Unless you are a multistate or multinational corporation, this bill doesn’t help you. If you are an individual sued in State court, this bill does not help you. If you are a smallbusiness owner only doing work in your State, this bill does not help you. Only multistate, multinational corporations get help from this bill, and that is why I call it the wrongdoers protection act for multistate and multinational corporations. Number two, it is burdensome. The Federal courts are already overworked and understaffed. The civil caseload is growing at 12 percent a year. There are currently 123 vacancies in our Federal judiciary. There is no reason to add to this burden by changing the law. Number three, this bill forces State court cases into Federal court. We have a crowd in this House that consistently preaches about states’ rights and the need to cut back on the Federal Government’s reach, but a bill like this comes along and they drop that state’s rights banner like it is a hot potato and pick up the coat of arms of the multistate, multinational corporations. If you really do care about states’ rights, you should be voting ‘‘no’’ on this bill. You see, these cases called diversity cases are filed in State court under State law. Ever since the 1930s, in the Erie Railroad case, if you take these cases and handle them in Federal court, the Federal judges are bound by law to follow State law, not Federal law. Mr. Chairman, there is nobody better at interpreting and following State law than State court judges. It stands to reason. I offer this amendment that is at the desk to exempt consumer cases against insurance companies for bad faith in insurance practices. If the majority is going to persist and present this gift to multistate and multinational corporations, at least include this amendment and protect consumers trying to fight insurance companies. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, this amendment continues to victimize innocent local parties just because they happen to be in an insurance case. The underlying bill is designed to protect folks from being dragged into a lawsuit just to facilitate forum shopping by plaintiffs’ attorneys. The purpose of this bill is to allow judges greater discretion to free these innocent local parties. They are the ones that are suffering as a result of this. This amendment denies the bill’s protection to innocent local parties joined to a lawsuit simply because the legal allegations in the case fall into one arbitrary category rather than another, just like the previous amendment. It is terribly unfair. Innocent people are innocent people, and they should be protected from being dragged into a lawsuit regardless of the nature of the case. The rules we have developed in this great country to protect the innocent are rules of general application, such as the rules protecting people’s rights to have their side of the story told and the rules protecting people from biased or inaccurate testimony. We should all be appalled by the suggestion that these general protections designed to protect innocent people from criminal liability should be suspended because the case is one of assault and battery or murder or somehow relates to insurance. It is the same kind of logic. b1545 Our country is rightfully proud of its principles providing due process and equal protection, but these concepts are meaningless if they are only selectively applied to some type of cases and not others. And for the same reason, we should all be outraged at the suggestion that the rules of fairness, designed to protect the innocent, should be suspended in civil law cases because a case involves one particular subject matter or another. But that is exactly what this misguided amendment does. This amendment would allow a plaintiff’s lawyer to drag an individual insurance adjuster into a lawsuit even when the applicable State law makes it absolutely clear that only insurers, not individual people, are subject to bad faith claims. How does the sponsor explain this to a person like Jack Stout, why a lawyer pulled him into a bad faith lawsuit targeting State Farm? Mr. Stout was a local insurance agent who merely sold a policy to the plaintiff, met and spoke with the plaintiff once, and had nothing to do with processing the plaintiff’s homeowner’s insurance claim. A Federal District Court in Oklahoma found he was fraudulently joined and dismissed the claim against him, but under this amendment, the innocent person would have been stuck back in the lawsuit. What about a person like Douglas Bradley, where the plaintiff’s lawyer named him as a defendant in a bad faith lawsuit against an insurer? In that case, the complaint included Mr. Bradley, an insurance agent, as a defendant in the caption of the case. It referred to defendant, singular, not defendants. Throughout the entire pleadings, it didn’t even mention his name. A Federal District Court in Indiana dismissed this claim against him as fraudulently joined, but under this amendment, this innocent person would have been stuck back in the lawsuit. It is not fair, it is expensive, and it is emotionally draining to these innocent parties. For that reason, I urge opposition to the amendment and support of the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. NUNES ) having assumed the chair, Mr. SIMPSON , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 725) to amend title 28, United States Code, to prevent fraudulent joinder, had come to no resolution thereon. 
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials to H.R. 985. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 180 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 985. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1549 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 985) to 
amend the procedures used in Federal court class actions and multidistrict litigation proceedings to assure fairer, more efficient outcomes for claimants and defendants, and for other purposes, with Mr. SIMPSON in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. FARENTHOLD. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, recently an independent research firm surveyed companies in 26 countries and found that 80 percent of those companies that were subject to class action lawsuits were U.S. companies, putting those U.S. companies at a distinct economic disadvantage when competing with companies worldwide. But the problem of overbroad class action doesn’t just affect U.S. companies. It affects consumers in the United States who are forced into lawsuits they don’t want to be in. How do we know that? We know that because the median rate at which consumer class action members take the compensation offered in a settlement is incredibly low. That would be 0.023 percent. That is twohundredths of a percent. That is right, only the tiniest fraction of consumer class action members bother to claim the compensation awarded them in a settlement. That is clear proof that vastly large numbers of class members are satisfied with the products they purchase, don’t want compensation, and don’t want to be lumped into a ginormous class action lawsuit. Federal judges are crying out for Congress to reform the class action lawsuit system, which currently allows trial lawyers to fill classes with hundreds and thousands of unmeritorious claims and use those artificially inflated claims to force defendants to settle the case. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has recognized that ‘‘A court’s decision to certify a class . . . places pressure on the defendant to settle even unmeritorious claims.’’ Judge Diane Wood of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, appointed by President Clinton, has explained that class certification ‘‘is, in effect, the whole case.’’ And as one appeals court judge, nominated by President Obama, wrote in his dissent in a recent class action case, ‘‘The chief difficulty we confront in this case arises from the fact that some of the members of the class have not suffered the . . . injury upon which this entire case is predicated and that could constitute as many as 24,000 consumers who would have no valid claim against the defendants under the state laws even if the named plaintiffs win on the merits.’’ He went on to chastise the other judges who allowed the class action to proceed, writing ‘‘if the district court does not identify a culling method to ensure that the class, by judgment, includes only members who were actually injured, this court has no business simply hoping that one will work.’’ The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of evaluating similar, meritorious claims, not to provide a way for lawyers to artificially inflate the size of a class to extort a larger settlement fee for themselves, siphoning money away from those actually injured, and increasing prices for everyone. Just look at an accounting of recent class action settlements. The SUBWAY food chain was sued in a class action because trial lawyers complained their footlong subs weren’t a full foot long. As part of the settlement, small amounts were paid to the 10 class representatives, but the millions of other class members received nothing; not a dime, not a sandwich. Meanwhile, the lawyers were awarded $520,000 in fees. The settlement was appealed, and during oral arguments Judge Diane Sykes remarked that ‘‘A class action that seeks only worthless benefits for the class should be dismissed out of hand. That’s what should have happened here. . . . This is a racket.’’ The CocaCola Company was sued in a class action lawsuit involving Vitaminwater. Class members received zero dollars in the settlement. The lawyers were awarded $1.2 million in fees. In a case involving Facebook, the company agreed to settle the case by paying class counsel $3 million. Zero dollars were paid to class members. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the deal, but in a withering dissent, Judge Kleinfeld observed that ‘‘Facebook users who had suffered damages . . . got no money, not a nickel, from the defendants. Class counsel, on the other hand, got millions.’’ This bill includes several reforms. It prevents people from being forced into a class with other uninjured or minimally injured class members, only to have the compensation of injured parties reduced. It prevents trial lawyers from using incestuous, litigationfactory arrangements to gin up lawsuits. It requires courts to use objective criteria in determining who is injured in a class action and how compensation will actually reach the victims. It requires that injured victims get paid first, before the lawyers, and that lawyer fees be limited to a reasonable percentage of the money received by victims. It requires judges to itemize exactly who gets what in a class action settlement and who is paying and controlling the lawyers. It requires all the rules governing class action be followed, that expensive pretrial proceedings be put on hold while the court determines if the case can’t meet class certification requirements, and allows appeals of those class certification orders so justice can be done faster. It ensures lawyers don’t add plaintiffs just for forum shopping purposes, and it requires the verification of allegations in multidistrict pretrial proceedings, ensuring defendants receive due process while plaintiffs, not lawyers, get the benefits of any cost savings achieved by the multidistrict pretrial process. H.R. 985 also contains provisions to include muchneeded transparency into the asbestos bankruptcy trust system. On too frequent an occasion, by the time asbestos victims assert their claims for compensation, the bankruptcy trust formed for their benefit has been diluted by fraudulent claims, leaving these victims without their entitled recovery. The reason that fraud is allowed to exist within the asbestos trust system is the excessive lack of transparency created by plaintiffs’ firms. The predictable result of this reduced transparency has been a growing wave of claims and reports of fraud. This bill strikes the proper balance of transparency and preserving the dignity and medical privacy of asbestos victims while also minimizing the administrative impact on the asbestos trusts. This bill saves the money in these trusts, which is a limited amount of money, to make sure future claimants, many of whom are veterans, have the opportunity to seek and receive compensation for their injuries and prevent doubledipping and fraud. Please join me in supporting this bill on behalf of consumers and injured parties everywhere. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 985, the socalled Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency Act of 2017. I want to thank my distinguished colleague from Texas for his presentation and for also making clear that the overriding purpose here is really to give the class action mechanism the guillotine. Now, this doesn’t formally abolish the class action mechanism. It is not the guillotine, but it is a straitjacket. Let’s be very clear, the whole purpose of this legislation is to make it virtually impossible for class action lawsuits to be brought by groups of citizens who share a common injury from things such as consumer ripoffs, pharmaceutical drug mistakes, faulty product design, sex discrimination, sexual harassment, poisonous breast implants, asbestos poisoning, lead poisoning, and so on—all of the billions of dollars worth of tort actions, nothing fraudulent about them, all of them already determined by courts and by juries to have taken place against our citizens, and they want to make it virtually impossible for people to proceed in court under the class action mechanism. I began with a very important process observation which I noted before, Mr. Chairman. There has been no hearing on this legislation. There have been 
no calls for this legislation from people allegedly suffering the horrors of the reviled class action lawyers. I notice that while my thoughtful colleague from Texas uses much of his time to deplore the work of plaintiffs’ lawyers, he says nothing about defendants’ lawyers, who have defended guilty parties in all of the cases we have mentioned before—all of the mass toxic torts, all of the drug injury cases, all of the environmental crimes and torts, all the asbestos poisoning and so on—and they have got a right to do that. They are simply doing their job. But the plaintiffs’ lawyers have a right to do their job, too. That is how our system works. I find it fundamentally disturbing that anybody would be out denouncing lawyers for representing people who have been injured in a tort case. But I oppose this misguided legislation because it sends another huge Valentine and wet kiss to large corporate polluters and tortfeasors but gives the finger to millions of American citizens who suffer injuries from these defendants. This legislation would shield corporate wrongdoers by making it far more difficult for them to get together to obtain justice in a class action lawsuit. So whether it is by making it almost impossible for Americans to pursue their day in court through the class action vehicle or threatening the privacy of asbestos victims, it is clear that H.R. 985 wants to give corporate polluters and tortfeasors the power to play hideandgoseek with their victims in Federal court whenever they want to. b1600 And it raises the broader question of who rightfully should hold power in a representative democracy like ours. Should it be large, private corporations, who are seeking rightfully their own profits? Or should it be the people, who are supposed to be sovereign? I say it is the people. This bill only favors the interests of the already powerful, to the detriment of the vast majority of the American people. In cases seeking monetary relief, the bill requires a party seeking class certification to show that every potential class member suffered the same type and scope of injury at the certification stage, something that is virtually impossible to do. This requirement alone would sound the death knell for class actions, which are the principal means we have in court for consumers to hold wrongdoers accountable, without having to engage in multiple duplicative actions all over a State or all over the country, piling up the expenses for courts. Most importantly, class actions make it feasible for those who have smaller but not inconsequential injuries to get justice. These injuries include diverse matters like products liability, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, and so on. It is already very difficult to pursue class actions. Under current law, the courts strictly limit the grounds by which a large group of plaintiffs may be certified as a class, including the existing requirement that their claims raise common and factual legal questions, and that the class representative’s claims must be typical of those of the other class members. Finally, title II of H.R. 985 gives asbestos defendants—the very entities whose products have injured millions of Americans—new weapons with which to go out and harm their victims. This part of the bill would require a bankruptcy asbestos trust to report on the court’s public case docket—which is then made immediately available on the internet—the name and exposure history of each asbestos victim who gets payment from a trust, as well as the basis of any payment made to that victim. As a result, the confidential personal information of asbestos claimants, including their names and entire exposure histories, would be irretrievably released into the public domain. Imagine what identity thieves, reporters, insurers, potential employers, lenders, and data collectors could do with this sensitive information. The proper title of this section of H.R. 985 should be the alternative fact act, not the FACT Act, because it penalizes the victims while favoring the perpetrators. The bill requires the trusts to make intrusive disclosures of victims’ personal information, but it makes no comparable demands on asbestos manufacturers, some of which intentionally concealed the lifethreatening dangers of their products not just for months or years, but for decades, the result of which millions of unsuspecting workers and consumers were exposed to this toxic substance. Essentially, this bill revictimizes asbestos victims by exposing their private information to all of the world— information that has absolutely nothing to do with compensation for asbestos exposure. Accordingly, I must oppose also this highly flawed provision of the legislation. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out to my colleague across the aisle that over the past several Congresses, we have had multiple hearings on class action reform and asbestos trust litigation, all of which are easily and publicly available. I further would like to go on to say this bill doesn’t prevent any claim from being brought as a class action— zero, zip, none. All it does is maximize the recovery of the victims. Under this bill, a class action lawyer’s fees are pegged to a reasonable percentage of the money actually received by the client under the settlement. What that will do is incentivize lawyers to make the maximum amount available to their clients, to seek the maximum recovery for their client. Under this bill, class action lawyers will no longer be able to agree to settlements that give them millions of dollars and get their clients absolutely nothing, or maybe a coupon, if they are lucky. Under this bill, a class action lawyer will get more in fees as long as they agree to a settlement that actually means that their clients, the actual plaintiffs, are getting a reasonable amount of money. Imagine that: incentivizing lawyers to do the best work for their clients. That is what this bill does. I would also like to talk for a second about the asbestos portion of this. I have to say that this is a little troubling for me. The disclosure requirements in the FACT Act portion of this bill requires less than would be required in a State court pleading for damages. It is the minimum amount of information necessary to make sure somebody isn’t doubledipping. It specifically protects medical records and social security numbers. It is designed as a fraud prevention tool. The argument that this is designed to protect companies that manufactured asbestos is flawed. This is designed for the asbestos trust—companies that have gone bankrupt and set aside large amounts of money to be paid to the victims of asbestos. This protects the assets in those trusts, not the tortfeasor companies. We are making sure there is enough money in these trusts to pay future victims by stopping fraudulent claims today. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am afraid that the eloquence of my opponent might cloud the issue for some of the people in America. So rather than having us go back and forth disputing the character of the legislation before you, I urge everybody to go to it. But let’s go to some of the people who care most about protecting innocent Americans from corporate wrongdoing and injury in the marketplace and in the workplace, and let’s see what they have got to say about it. Mr. Chairman, I have a letter to the House from groups who oppose this legislation as an assault on the rights of consumers and workers, including the Alliance for Justice, the American Association for Justice, Americans for Financial Reform, the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, the California Kids IAQ, the Center for Justice and Democracy, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, Central Florida Jobs with Justice, Coal River Mountain Watch, the Committee to Support the Antitrust Laws, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Watchdog, Consumers for Auto 
Reliability and Safety, Consumers Union. I have just gone through the Cs. I am not going to take us all the way through the Zs, Mr. Chairman. But America’s consumer groups are opposed to this legislation, and America’s workers’ groups are opposed to this legislation. It is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, Mr. Chairman. I have also gotten, specifically on the asbestos point, a letter from groups concerned with occupational health and safety who strongly oppose the Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act, saying that this bill will drain critical resources that have been set aside to secure justice for victims of asbestos diseases, while simultaneously publishing those victims’ personal information on the internet. Included in this very long list of opponents are the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, the Communications Workers of America, the Maine Labor Group on Health, the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, the New Jersey State Industrial Union Council, and on and on. So, again, they pushed this legislation through the House of Representatives at the speed of light, but under the cloak of darkness with no hearing at all. And then they come out and say: It is really for you, trust us. We are the Federal Government. We are here to help you. We are going to move all of the cases into Federal Court, and we are going to make it a lot easier to nullify class actions. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ). Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 985, the socalled Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act. This outrageous legislation would severely limit the ability of injured consumers and workers to obtain relief through class action lawsuits. If that were not bad enough, the bill also contains a totally unrelated measure to violate the privacy of asbestos victims, and subject them to potential discrimination. Together, this legislation is just one more measure in the Republican parade of bills this week to further tilt the playing field in favor of wealthy corporations over ordinary people. Class action suits are an essential tool to enable victims of corporate wrongdoing to be compensated for their injuries and to deter future misconduct. Plaintiffs often seek to band together as a class when the potential damages they could receive individually are too low to make it practical to hire a lawyer and bring a lawsuit alone. But, as members of a class, they have the power to secure relief from a multimilliondollar company and put an end to its illegal practices. That is exactly why the big corporations oppose them. It makes it harder for those companies to operate with impunity from the law, with little regard for the injuries they may cause. It was class action lawsuits that helped uncover years of corrupt practices in the tobacco industry and began to turn around a public health disaster, not to mention recover billions of dollars. It was class action lawsuits that revealed contamination of groundwater that cause certain forms of cancer. It was class action lawsuits that revealed fraudulent pricing practices and misleading advertising by drug companies, widespread employment discrimination, and predatory payday lending practices. Class action lawsuits also helped expose and bring down the sham university peddled on winning victims by the current occupant of the White House. But this bill includes a range of provisions that would make such class action suits practically impossible. For example, it would require each member of a class to suffer ‘‘the same type and scope of injury’’ as the named class representative. What this means is that if two people use a defective product, but one suffers firstdegree burns while the other person suffers thirddegree burns, they cannot join together in a class because their injuries are of a different scope. Or take a company with a pattern of racial discrimination. If some workers are being paid less than others for doing the same job while other workers find themselves repeatedly passed over for deserved promotions, they cannot join in the same class action because they would not be deemed to have suffered the same type of injury—one having been paid less, the other having been passed over for promotions—despite being victims of the same discriminatory policies. This is just one of a host of unnecessary and onerous requirements placed on victims by this bill that makes it virtually impossible to form a class. When added together, it amounts to a giant bailout for wealthy corporations at the expense of injured consumers and workers. Mr. Chairman, we do not want the Federal courts to be simply collection agencies to large corporations. We need justice for the small, ordinary person. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to defeat this legislation. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. NADLER for his excellent comments. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON). Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 985, a monster of a bill, combining the anticonsumer Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act and the antivictim Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act. H.R. 985 has the same goals and objectives as the bill that just slithered out of this body just a few moments ago, the socalled Innocent Party Protection Act, which more appropriately should be called, the Corporate Wrongdoer Protection Act. H.R. 985 is part of a wave of anticonsumer corporate wrongdoer protection bills being considered this week by this Republicancontrolled Congress. The purpose of these bills is to protect and insulate big corporations from being held accountable when they rob, hurt, and maim everyday Americans struggling to make it here in America. As a former and longterm Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I would like to first remind this body of Susan Vento and Judy Van Ness, brave widows, who joined us during the Judiciary Committee markup of the FACT Act and shared with us the heartbreak asbestos exposure has caused their families. Susan is the widow of our late colleague, Congressman Bruce Vento. Judy’s husband, Richard, was a Navy veteran, who served this country with distinction. Both men saw their lives tragically cut short—Bruce at 60 and Richard at 62—both by mesothelioma. Georgia is ranked 23rd in the Nation for mesothelioma and asbestoscaused deaths, in part due to the large number of military operations, facilities, and military industrial complex projects throughout the State. Virtually every ship commissioned by the U.S. Navy between World War II and the Korean war contained several tons of asbestos in the engine room insulation, fireproof doors, and miles of pipes. While the military discontinued asbestos products around 1980, hundreds of military and civilian installations were left with asbestos in the flooring and ceiling tiles, cement foundations, as well as in thousands of military vehicles. b1615 After defending our freedom abroad, many veterans returned to the civilian workforce where they were further exposed to asbestos, people such as Richard Van Ness, who suffered asbestos exposure while on a Navy destroyer and during his career as a union pipefitter. Unfortunately, veterans like Richard comprise over 30 percent of all asbestoscaused mesothelioma deaths, despite making up only 8 percent of the Nation’s population. Eighteen veterans’ groups, including the Military Order of the Purple Heart, AMVETS, and the Vietnam Veterans of America, these organizations have expressed their strong opposition to this bill. I include a letter from them in the RECORD . 
FEBRUARY 14, 2017. Re Veterans Service Organization oppose the ‘‘Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency (FACT) Act’’. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington DC. Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY , Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington DC. Hon. BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman, House Judiciary Committee, House of Representatives, Washington DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. STENY HOYER , Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. JOHNCONYERS , Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN, LEADER MCCARTHY , LEADER PELOSI , W HIP HOYER , C HAIRMAN  GOODLATTE , ANDRANKING MEMBER CONYERS : We, the undersigned Veterans Service Organizations oppose the ‘‘Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency (FACT) Act.’’ We have continuously expressed our united opposition to this legislation via written testimony to the House Judiciary Committee, House Leadership, inperson meetings and phone calls with members of Congress. It is extremely disappointing that even with our combined opposition, the FACT Act will be marked up in the House Judiciary Committee later this week. Veterans across the country disproportionately make up those who are dying and afflicted with mesothelioma and other asbestos related illnesses and injuries. Although veterans represent only 8% of the nation’s population, they comprise 30% of all known mesothelioma deaths. When our veterans and their family members file claims with the asbestos bankruptcy trusts to receive compensation for harm caused by asbestos companies, they submit personal, highly sensitive information such as how and when they were exposed to the deadly product, sensitive health information, and more. The FACT Act would require asbestos trusts to publish their sensitive information on a public database, and include how much money they received for their claim as well as other private information. Forcing our veterans to publicize their work histories, medical conditions, majority of their social security numbers, and information about their children and families is an offensive invasion of privacy to the men and women who have honorably served, and it does nothing to assure their adequate compensation or to prevent future asbestos exposures and deaths. Additionally, the FACT Act helps asbestos companies add significant time and delay paying trust claims to our veterans and their families by putting burdensome and costly reporting requirements on trusts, including those that already exist. Trusts will instead spend valuable time and resources complying with these additional and unnecessary requirements delaying desperately needed compensation for our veterans and their families to cover medical bills and end of life care. The FACT Act is a bill that its supporters claim will help asbestos victims, but the reality is that this bill only helps companies and manufacturers who knowingly exposed asbestos to our honorable men and women who have made sacrifices for our country. We urgently ask on behalf of our members across the nation that you oppose the FACT Act. Signed: Air Force Association; Air Force Sergeants Association; Air ForceWomen Officers Associated; AMVETS; AMSUS, the Society of Federal Health Professionals; Association of the United Statse Navy; Commissioned Officers Associatuion of the US Public Health Service, Inc.; Fleet Reserve Association; Jewish War Veterans of the USA; Military Officers Association of America; Military Order of the Purple Heart of the U.S.A.; National Defense Council; Naval Enlisted Reserve Association; Non Commissioned Officers Association of the United States of America; The Retired Enlisted Association, USCG; Chief Petty Officers Association; US Army Warrant Officers Association; Vietnam Veterans of America. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. RASKIN. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentleman, and I would ask my colleagues to join me and the distinguished members of those 18 veterans’ organizations and oppose this bill. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Clearly there are two groups of individuals who we are not fearful will commit fraud. It is our Nation’s veterans and servicemembers. At the same time, there is no reason to distinguish between the disclosure obligation of veteran servicemembers and the disclosure obligations of ordinary citizens. This FACT Act provision is designed to protect veterans from fraud and make sure our future veterans who are exposed and other people who are exposed in their jobs to asbestos have the resources available because the company that actually made the asbestos is most likely bankrupt and out of business now. There are finite resources in these trusts, and we owe it to our servicemembers and to future victims of asbestosis or mesothelioma to make sure there is money there to take care of their medical bills and compensate them for the injuries. That is the purpose of the FACT Act portion of this bill. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017. Mr. Chairman, there can be no doubt that this legislation is an assault on the civil justice system. By effectively banning class actions, H.R. 985 would give wrongdoers a permission slip to avoid public scrutiny or liability for their unlawful conduct. Worse still, this legislation also contains the text of the socalled FACT Act, which is designed to delay justice for asbestos victims and deny accountability for corporate defendants. As the ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee that exercises jurisdiction over this bill, I am strongly opposed to this dangerous and offensive measure. For decades, medical experts have closely linked asbestos exposure with mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer, and other forms of lung disease. Asbestos manufacturers have also known about the deadly effects of asbestos exposure; but, as a Federal judge noted in 1991, there is compelling evidence that these companies sought to conceal this information from workers and the general public. Instead of sharing this critical information, which could have saved countless lives through exposure prevention, asbestos companies ‘‘continued to manufacture one of the most widely used asbestos products without informing workers or the public,’’ as the nonprofit Environmental Working Group has reported. Real examples of this widespread corporate deception are legion, but one in particular stands out. In 1966, the senior executive of a corporation that currently operates as a subsidiary of Honeywell wrote that, if asbestos victims ‘‘enjoyed a good life while working with asbestos products, why not die from it.’’ In the wake of numerous lawsuits related to asbestosrelated deaths, Congress amended the bankruptcy code in 1994 to authorize the use of trusts for the settlement of asbestos liability. In 2001, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office conducted an exhaustive study of these trusts but did not find a single example of fraudulent conduct. Despite this finding, proponents of H.R. 985 now make the outrageous and totally unsupported claim that victims of asbestos exposure have committed fraud—more alternative facts. In the name of what they describe as transparency, the bill would force trusts to publicly disclose asbestos victims’ sensitive personal information, including their names, partial Social Security numbers, and the like. Beyond the obvious consequences these requirements would have in the form of hacking and identity theft, this information is already available to relevant parties on a confidential basis through the discovery process, as both the GAO and the RAND Corporation have reported. I agree with the majority that asbestos trusts must be accountable and transparent to both present and future claimants, but there is no evidence to suggest any wrongdoing or any fraud. This legislation would only make it easier for wrongdoers to get away with harming others and to make it harder for Americans to be compensated for these injuries. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 985. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am going to have to beg to differ with my colleague from across the aisle. Fraud has been documented in news reports, State court cases, and in testimony before the Judiciary Committee. 
The Wall Street Journal conducted an investigation that found thousands of dispiritedly filed claims. Court documents in many States, including Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia, attest to widespread fraud. Most recently, a bankruptcy case in North Carolina uncovered a startling number of dispiritedly filed claims. Additionally, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony over the course of four hearings about the FACT Act, during which witnesses repeatedly testified that fraud existed within the asbestos trust bankruptcy situation. Keep in mind that the fraud reported today has been in spite of the lack of disclosure that exists. Consistent with other multimillion dollar compensation programs, there is fraud occurring in the asbestos trust system, and the FACT Act will go a long way to uncovering that fraud. The FACT Act is designed to provide the minimum amount of transparency necessary to prevent this fraud while protecting the personal information of those victims of asbestos. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ). Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, asbestos is a deadly poison. It can cause lung cancer and mesothelioma. Once detected, these patients survive only, on average, 8 to 14 months. It was true for Congressman Bruce Vento, who proudly served the families of Minnesota’s Fourth District for more than 23 years in this House. Bruce was a friend, and he died from mesothelioma 8
1⁄2months after he was diagnosed. Congress has a responsibility to find real solutions to support mesothelioma victims and their families, but H.R. 985 would not support the families. In fact, it exposes families at a time of great vulnerableness. It exposes them by putting their identity, their name, their address, and the last four digits of their Social Security number on a public website—a public website—when this information has already been given in a confidential manner. It is especially outrageous to me that once again this legislation is on the floor and it fails to protect children who are victims of asbestos exposure from having their information shared publicly. Parents should have the peace of mind knowing that their child’s privacy is secure and not on the internet where who knows who would be out possibly preying on them. I ask my colleagues to stand with me, stand with the mesothelioma victims, stand with their families, stand with their children, and oppose this bill, as they have asked me to do. Mr. FARENTHOLD. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT.) Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in opposition to H.R. 985. In addition to the legislation’s many problems that have already been mentioned by my colleagues, I am particularly concerned about what the bill does in the socalled FACT Act, which will have a devastating impact on workers exposed to asbestos. I am acutely aware of the devastating impact that asbestos exposure has on working men and women in this country because I represent an area with several shipyards. In the last few decades, in my district alone, several thousand local shipyard workers have developed asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma from asbestos exposure that occurred between the 1940s and 1970s. Hundreds of these workers have already died, and asbestos deaths and disabilities are continuing due to the long latency period associated with this illness. I believe that we cannot consider the legislation affecting the victims of asbestos exposure without remembering exactly who caused the problem. Court findings show that the companies made willful and malicious decisions to expose their employees to asbestos. Here are a couple of examples. One case, in 1986, after hearing both sides, the New Jersey Supreme Court declared: It is indeed appalling to us that the company had so much information of the hazards of asbestos workers as early as the mid1930s and that it not only failed to use that information to protect the workers, but, more egregiously, it also attempted to withhold this information from the public. 
A few years earlier, the Superior Court, Appellate Division, in New Jersey said that: ‘‘The jury here was justified in concluding that both defendants, fully appreciating the nature, extent, and gravity of the risk, nevertheless made a conscious and coldblooded business decision, in utter and flagrant disregard of the rights of others, to take no protective or remedial action.’’ In a separate case in Florida, after hearing both sides, the court declared that: 
The clear and convincing evidence in this case revealed that, for more than 30 years, the company concealed what it knew about the dangers of asbestos. In fact, the company’s conduct was even worse than concealment. It also included intentional and knowing misrepresentations concerning the danger of its asbestoscontaining product. 
That is who we are talking about. These are the types of companies who will benefit from this legislation. Any suggestion that people are getting paid more than once is absurd. The fact of the matter is, because of bankruptcies, most of them aren’t getting anywhere close to what they actually should be receiving, but the bill before us does not help those victims. It actually hurts them. The bill is nothing more than a scheme to delay the proceedings and allow the victims to get even less than they are getting now. Because of the delay, many of the victims will die before they get to court. This helps the guilty corporations that have inflicted this harm on innocent victims because, if the plaintiffs die before they get to court, their pain and suffering damages are extinguished. If they can delay the cases enough so that the plaintiffs die before they get to trial, the corporations will not only get to delay their payments, but when they finally pay, they will pay much less. These are the people who made those conscious and coldblooded business decisions. Those are the ones who will actually benefit from this legislation at the expense of hardworking, innocent victims. The victims of this corporate wrongdoing oppose this bill. Regrettably, many of those victims are our veterans because they were working aboard Navy ships. Mr. Chair, we should reject this legislation. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We obviously have a different vantage point on what is taking place in the civil courtrooms of America today. On our side, we look out over America and in the courts and we see millions of our neighbors, our fellow citizens who are suffering the effects of asbestos poisoning, which is real, not imaginary; lead poisoning, which is real, not imaginary; and manufacturing defects by large automobile manufacturers and others. They look at it and all they see is fraud, and they want to put the class action mechanism in a straightjacket to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for people to pursue class actions. They want to put the names of asbestos victims up online for the whole world to see. Obviously, we have got a division of opinion within the legislative branch. What about the judiciary itself? Well, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the policymaking arm of the Federal judiciary, and the American Bar Association both strongly oppose H.R. 985. The conference report that has been studying class actions for 5 years has considered many of the issues addressed in H.R. 985. It strongly urges Congress not to amend the class action procedures found in rule 23 outside the Rules Enabling Act process. b1630 Likewise, the ABA observes the many problems of advancing comprehensive class action reform without a hearing to examine all the complicated issues involved with so many rule changes. Mr. Chairman, the other side invoked some hearings. I was astonished to hear it because I have been here for several months. I just joined Congress. I didn’t have any hearings. It turns out I understand they were referring to 
hearings that took place last year, perhaps the year before, where I understand—but all of it is hearsay to me because I wasn’t here—that actual victims of asbestos poisoning were not permitted themselves to testify. It was a completely onesided, lopsided process, and I will try to get to the bottom of that in order to determine it. This is what happens when they are moving legislation through this body at lightening speed, but really in the thick of darkness because we don’t have any meaningful, transparent communication about what the underlying issues are. Well, I restate my opposition to this. The class action mechanism has been a central vehicle for justice for Americans for many decades. And now without so much as a hearing, without the mobilization of any proof that this should be done over the objections of the Judicial Conference of the United States, over the objections of the American Bar Association, and over the objections of every consumer group and worker group that has written in that I have seen, they are purporting to be acting in the name of the American people. In fact, what they are doing is they are pulling the rug out from underneath the class action vehicle. Class actions have been so central to vindicating the rights of people who have been victimized by corporate polluters and toxic contaminators and automobile manufacturers who knowingly put defective instruments into cars, leading to people’s deaths and injuries, and they want to make it more difficult for people to pursue justice in the courts. I urge all of my colleagues to study this legislation the best they can and to reject it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to address the fact that there have been numerous hearings on the FACT Act and the problems associated with it. There was one hearing before the Judiciary Committee on the Constitution on September 9, 2011. There were three legislative hearings before the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law, one during the 112th Congress, one during the 113th Congress, and one during the 114th Congress. I am sure the gentleman’s staff could have gotten him copies of those. I also point out that the minority used these opportunities to call witnesses that were representatives of the plaintiffs’ asbestos trial bar. They called the attorneys to voice their concern about the bill, not the victims. In fact, the minority called the same witness for three out of the four hearings. Now they claim that asbestos victims were never provided an opportunity to testify. The Judiciary Committee has provided ample opportunity to include asbestos victims’ views on the legislation in the record, and there are many letters and statements from victims in the record. In closing, I do want to say—going back to the class action part of this bill for a second only—that only the tiniest fraction of consumers in class actions bother to claim the compensation awarded them in the settlement. That is clear proof that the vastly large number of class members are satisfied with the products they have purchased, don’t want compensation, and don’t want to be lumped into a gigantic class action lawsuit. Federal judges are crying out for Congress to reform the class action system, which currently allows trial lawyers to fill classes with hundreds and thousands of meritorious claims and use those artificially inflated classes to force defendants to settle the case. As I recounted, class action settlements have left lawyers with millions of dollars while victims receive absolutely nothing or a coupon, at best. The bill prevents people from being forced into class actions with other uninjured or minimally injured members only to have the compensation of injured parties reduced. It requires that lawyer fees be limited to a reasonable percentage of the money injured victims actually receive. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I also want to talk a second about the FACT Act. We hear these stories about these corporations that did all of this wrong. Many of them are bankrupt, and the only money available to the victims are the money that has been set aside in these asbestos trust funds. When an unscrupulous attorney makes a claim against multiple trusts or files claims in Federal court and State court, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find out if that claim has already been made. The FACT Act makes that easily available while providing privacy necessary to protect the victims. The FACT Act is designed to protect the future victims and make sure there is money there for the children, for the veterans, for the hardworking Americans who are injured by asbestos but whose symptoms have not yet manifested. Sometimes these asbestosrelated diseases take decades to show up, and there needs to be money there to take care of those folks. That is what this legislation is intending to do, not to protect corporations. I urge my colleagues to support this bill that provides muchneeded reform to the class action system and to the asbestos trust system. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to Rules Committee Print 115–5 of H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017, which is a radical measure that would overturn centuries of American law. This committee print buries the ‘‘Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017,’’ crammed through committee on a partyline vote, within the overarching legislation intended to effectively obliterate class actions in America, H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2017. I oppose this twoforone bill combination because it will, in sum, undermine the enforcement of this Nation’s civil rights laws and upend decades of settled class action law. The fact that the House would even consider such sweeping, reckless legislation without holding a single hearing is an outrage. This poorly drafted legislation will create needless chaos in the courts without actually solving any demonstrated problem. Class action lawsuits are among the most important tools to enable injured, cheated, and or victimized individuals and small businesses to hold large corporations and institutions accountable and deter future misconduct. H.R. 985 would eviscerate that tool. Let me remind my colleagues that class actions are critical for the enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, education, and access to public areas and services. As the Supreme Court has recognized in Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, class actions provide ‘‘vindication of the rights of groups of people who individually would be without effective strength to bring their opponents into court at all.’’ Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997). Courts have interpreted Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the federal class action rule, over decades and the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules has, through its deliberative process, reviewed and amended the rule to ensure its fair and efficient operation. No further revisions are needed at this time. Civil rights injuries are never identical and are already subject to rigorous judicial review. H.R. 985 imposes a new and impossible hurdle for class certification. This alone would sound the death knell for most class actions. It requires that the proponents of the class demonstrate that each class member has suffered the same type and scope of injury. At this early stage of a civil rights class action, it is frequently impossible to identify all of the victims or the precise nature of each of their injuries. Classes inherently include a range of affected individuals, and in no case does every member of the class suffer the same scope of injury from the same wrongful act. But even if this information were knowable, class members’ injuries would not be the same. As a simple example, those overcharged for rent will have different injuries. In an employment discrimination class action, the extent of a class member’s injuries will depend on a range of factors, including their job position, tenure, employment status, salary, and length of exposure to the discriminatory conditions. For this reason, nearly forty years ago, the Supreme Court developed a twostage process for such cases in International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. U.S., 431 U.S. 324, 371–72 (1977). In the first stage, the court determines whether the employer engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination. 
If the employer is found liable, the court holds individual hearings to determine the relief (if any) for each victim. The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the use of the Teamsters model for discrimination class actions in part because of the individualized nature of injuries. In the case of WalMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 366 (2011). Thus, this bill would overturn the approach established four decades ago to permit a class of victims of discrimination to seek effective relief. Certainly, many civil rights, discrimination and employment class actions, including cases involving refusals by companies to properly pay workers, would not satisfy these criteria. Some provisions would make it even more difficult to bring race and gender discrimination class actions. Other provisions would have a dramatic impact on cases against toxic polluters. For example, arbitrary and unworkable standards for attorneys’ fees undermine civil rights enforcement. If a case is successful, the judge awards a reasonable fee based upon the time that the advocates have spent working on the case. This method of determining attorneys’ fees provides for consistent and predictable outcomes, which is a benefit to all parties in a lawsuit. H.R. 985 would entirely displace this well settled law with a standard long ago rejected as arbitrary and unworkable. Under the bill, attorneys’ fees would be calculated as a percentage of the value of the equitable relief. § 1718(b)(3). But how is a judge to determine the cash value of an integrated school, a welloperating foster care system, the deinstitutionalization of individuals with disabilities, or myriad other forms of equitable relief secured by civil rights class actions? Asking judges to assign a price tag in such cases is an impossible task and would lead to uncertainty and inconsistency. Nonprofit organizations cannot bear the risk of these long and expensive cases if, at the end, their fees are calculated under this incoherent and capricious standard. Indeed, the bill creates an incentive for defendants to prolong the litigation so as to make it economically impossible for plaintiffs’ attorneys to continue to prosecute the litigation. In addition, by considering this bill now, Congress is circumventing the process that Congress itself established for promulgation of federal court rules under the Rules Enabling Act, bypassing both the Judicial Conference of the United States and the U.S. Supreme Court. Civil rights class actions are often about systemic reforms that benefit the most vulnerable. Interference with the proper federal court rules process is reckless and irresponsible, particularly when this proposal is so damaging to victims. Mr. Chair, the only beneficiaries of the so called FACT Act, are the very entities that knowingly produced a toxic substance that killed or seriously injured thousands of unsuspecting American consumers and workers. The FACT Act would force asbestos patients seeking any compensation from a private asbestos trust fund to reveal on a public web site private information including the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, and personal information about their families and children. In fact, not a single asbestos victim has come forward in support of this legislation. Worse, this bill would allow victims of asbestos exposure to be further victimized by requiring this information about their illness to be made publicly available to virtually anyone who has access to the Internet. For example, the bill requires all payment demands, as well as, the names and exposure histories of each claimant—together with the basis for any payment the trust made to such claimants—to be publicly disclosed. This sensitive information must be posted on the court’s public docket, which is easily accessible through the Internet with the payment of a nominal fee. Once irretrievably released into the public domain, this information would be a virtual treasure trove for data collectors and other entities for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with compensation for asbestos exposure. Insurance companies, prospective employers, lenders, and predatory scam artists as well as the victim’s neighbors would have access to this information. Many of the people who would be hurt by the FACT Act are veterans, who are disproportionately affected by asbestos disease. To address this serious failing of the bill, I offered an amendment which would ensure that the quarterly reports required under the FACT Act, contain only aggregate payment information. My amendment also deletes the bill’s burdensome discovery requirement. As noted by the widow of our former colleague Congressman Bruce Vento who passed away from asbestosinduced mesothelioma, the bill’s public disclosure of victims’ private information: ‘‘could be used to deny employment, credit, and health, life, and disability insurance.’’ Mrs. Vento also warned that asbestos victims ‘‘would be more vulnerable to identity thieves, con men, and other types of predators.’’ Supporters of this legislation say that Bankruptcy Code section 107 will prevent such results. But, they are wrong; this provision only permits—it does not require—the bankruptcy court to issue a protective order. In fact, such relief may only be granted for cause if the court finds that ‘‘disclosure of such information would create undue risk of identity theft or other unlawful injury to the individual.’’ What this means is that an asbestos victim would have to retain counsel and go to court in order to prove cause to obtain relief. And, even though Bankruptcy Rule 9037 does require certain types of personal information to be redacted from a document filed in a bankruptcy case, said Rule would be overridden by this legislation, as written. Accordingly, for these reasons and more, I oppose this harmful legislation. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. JOYCE of Ohio). All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–5. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, the manager’s amendment makes several technical changes to the bill, none of which alter its basic policy, but all of which add clarity to the bill where necessary. First, in the section of the bill governing conflicts of interest, this amendment strikes the prohibition on the use of the same class counsel if the named plaintiff is a present or former client or has a contractual relationship with the class counsel. In some instances, those restrictions may unduly limit the availability of class counsel or class representatives, so this amendment would remove them. It also clarifies that nothing in the conflicts of interest section of the bill applies to securities class actions, which have their own provisions for selection of class representatives and counsel elsewhere in the U.S. Code. The same exemption for securities class actions is made to the stay of discovery section of the bill because, again, securities class actions have their own discovery stay provisions elsewhere in the U.S. Code. Second, the amendment makes technical changes to the misjoinder section of the bill, making clear it applies only to civil actions commenced in State court and subsequently removed to Federal court, and that a Federal court can retain jurisdiction over claims that are so related to each other that they form part of the same case and controversy under Article III of the Constitution, and the plaintiff consents to the removal of the claim. Third, the amendment extends from 30 days to 90 days the amount of time for Federal courts to review the sufficiency of the allegations verification submissions made in the section on multidistrict litigation. The amendment also makes clear that a particular case may not be tried in a multidistrict proceeding unless all parties in that particular case consent— not all parties in the entire multidistrict proceeding. And it also makes clear in the section providing that the claimant shall not receive less than 80 percent of any monetary recovery, that such section does not alter the claimant’s obligations to satisfy liens on the recovery—that is, debts owed to the Federal Government or to private insurers—for medical services received by the claimant for the treatment of the injuries alleged in the litigation. So, for example, if a person took a medicine and alleges he suffered injury as a result, a Federal program may 
have paid for the treatment of the injury. If the person gets a settlement of his claim, it would include money for those medical services that should be paid back to the Federal Government. The revision makes clear that the satisfaction of such liens should come out of the 80 percent received by the claimant. The amendment also makes clear that the authorization for appeals from orders in MDL proceedings is limited to cases seeking redress for personal injury. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these clarifying and improving amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the manager’s amendment to H.R. 985 with all due deference to the chair of our committee. Although the amendment makes a number of mostly technical amendments to the bill, it still fails to address the numerous fundamental flaws that we have identified in the underlying legislation, which is a dagger pointing at the heart of class action lawsuits in America. The major substantive change that I noted under the manager’s amendment was that class certification would still be prohibited when a named plaintiff or class representative is a relative or employee of the class counsel, but made some other changes narrowing the scope of the conflict of interest provision slightly. The amendment still fails to address the fundamental problem with that provision, which is that there is no justification for concluding that the specified relationships are, per se, problematic or that class certification should be denied just because such a relationship exists. The general problem pervading the legislation remains. The first is a procedural problem, which we have identified. I was delighted that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) responded to our complaint that we had had no hearings on the bill. In response to that, he directed my attention to a hearing that took place in 2011, 6 years ago. There are nine members of the Judiciary Committee who just joined this year and many dozens of Members who have joined the House since 2011. It is true that we could go back and read it within the 24 hours we had to do that before the markup took place. We could also go back and just read at that point the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to everybody a jury trial which attempts to establish civil justice in America. What we are getting instead is an attempt to put class action lawsuits and civil liability into a straitjacket. It is an attempt to make it far harder for people to see their rights vindicated when they have been violated by an auto manufacturer, someone who is putting asbestos into materials that are being used near servicemembers, those who are selling poisonous breast implants, and so on. I am rising in opposition to the amendment simply because it does nothing to answer the many massive objections leveled against this legislation by consumer groups like the Consumer Federation of America, by groups defending civil justice, like the Alliance for Justice, and indeed by the Judicial Conference of the United States and the American Bar Association, both of which strongly oppose this legislation because they do not think it is warranted. They don’t think that it responds to any problems that are really out there. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ). The amendment was agreed to. b1645 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . DEUTCH  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part B of House Report 115–29. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 3, strike line 22, and insert the following: ‘‘In a class action’’. Page 4, strike line 9, and all that follows through line 19. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, the right to choose one’s own counsel is a basic right in our democracy. This is a right that is a foundation of a fair and impartial judicial system. Having the right to choose one’s own attorney ensures that a person can hire an attorney who will best represent their interests and protect their rights in the judicial process. H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, undermines this basic right by requiring a court to deny any class action certification based solely on a proposed class representative or named plaintiff being represented by a family member. The bill provides no discretion to the court and no exceptions. The bill uses an expansive definition that includes not only immediate family members, but extended parts of a family tree by blood and marriage. Such a broad definition is an unfair restriction on the right to an attorney of one’s own choosing. Previously, the manager’s amendment modified this provision but did not relieve these concerns. Such broad, blanket assumptions about family relationships fail to recognize the importance of trust and expertise into the attorneyclient relationship. In many instances, a family member will best represent their interests in court or could have specialized training and experience relevant to the case, yet the language in this bill does not provide for any discretion or any exceptions. The fact that a lawyer representing a potential class is a family member of a named class member does not, in itself, create a conflict of interest; and under current law, there is a process for courts to address real conflicts of interest when they arise. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 23(g), courts have an extensive list that must be satisfied when appointing counsel to represent a class. There also already is a strong disincentive against conflicts through fairness hearings after settlement is reached. Any potential conflict of interest risks spoiling the agreement and wasting the efforts of counsel and the class. Removing the discretion of the courts is overly broad and will remove access to appropriate counsel where no conflict exists. I urge strong support for my amendment and the removal of this provision from this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be defeated. Abraham Lincoln left behind pages of notes on a lecture he was to give to lawyers. They say: ‘‘Never stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be found than one who does this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually overhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles, whereon to stir up strife and put money in his pocket?’’ That was Lincoln in the 1850s. Here is Forbes Magazine just a couple of years ago: 
The lead plaintiff in the 5Hour case . . . worked in marketing for a cosmetic surgery center in California. But in a grueling 5hour deposition, she admitted she had been recruited to serve as a plaintiff by her cousin, who worked for a Texas lawyer; had purchased two bottles of 5–Hour ENERGY specifically to sue the manufacturer; had never complained to the company or sought a refund; and had signed a backdated retainer agreement with the trial lawyer, Rubinstein, the fellow seen here at his own deposition. . . . Another one of Rubinstein’s clients . . . admitted she had served as a plaintiff for Rubinstein in at least four class actions over products like Swanson pot pies and lipstick. . . . Emails and other communications 5– Hour’s lawyers uncovered in their suit showed that Rubinstein belonged to a loose affiliation of lawyers who ran an assembly line process of identifying companies to sue and then helping each other find plaintiffs. 
Lawsuits are supposed to be initiated by truly injured plaintiffs seeking redress, not invented by lawyers who hunt for a plaintiff to assert a supposed injury made up by the lawyer. Few class members bother to collect the payments available in class action settlements, in large part because they don’t feel injured by the supposedly wrongful conduct in the first place. In too many cases, trial lawyers come up with an idea for a lawsuit and then search for a person who has bought the product, or they send a relative or employee to buy the product so they will have someone who can sue on behalf of a proposed class of all other buyers. No product purchaser has actually complained or feels cheated; it is just lawyers in pursuit of money. That is a major reason why so few class members bother to collect the payments available in class action settlements. They don’t feel injured by the supposedly wrongful conduct in the first place. This abuse of the class action lawyer driven lawsuits must end. The base bill, therefore, requires lawyers to disclose how proposed class representatives became involved in the class action. Further, it prohibits class actions in which any proposed class representative, that is, a named plaintiff that will be representing everyone else in the class action, is a relative of or an employee of the class action lawyer. Further clarifications making clear that this provision will not apply to present or former clients of, or those who have had any contractual relationship with, class counsel have already been made to the bill in the manager’s amendment. The only prohibition that remains in the bill is the bar on class counsel using a relative or employee as a class representative. Clearly, that shouldn’t be permitted. The class representative is supposed to be representing the class interests, to independently ‘‘be the client’’ for the class, and tell counsel what to do. That independence will be gone if the class representative is a relative or employee of the class counsel. This amendment should be defeated. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this important amendment to ensure that they have an opportunity to be heard when they are injured by an attorney of their choice. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . DEUTCH  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of House Report 115–29. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 6, strike line 1 and all that follows through line 8. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to vote, the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and other rights enumerated in the Constitution have an intrinsic value that cannot be adequately expressed in dollars and cents. When a person’s constitutional rights are violated, they cannot be made whole entirely with money, and yet the bill that we have before us today would require our judicial system to hang a price tag on our most cherished constitutional rights. Under H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, if a ‘‘judgment or proposed settlement in a class action provides for equitable relief, the portion of any attorney’s fee award to class counsel that is attributed to the equitable relief shall be limited to a reasonable percentage of the value of the equitable relief, including any injunctive relief.’’ Mr. Chairman, when a court grants such relief, it is not awarding money to a plaintiff. In these cases, the courts are stepping in to say this is a violation of constitutional rights and it must stop. My amendment would strike the provision in this bill that would devalue our fundamental rights by requiring a highly subjective and wasteful, costly, and demeaning process of putting a price tag on these rights. Worse, it would deter attorneys from bringing critical civil lawsuits that reform systemic and widespread violations of individual rights. When we think of class actions, we usually imagine a group of people seeking money to compensate them for an injury or a harm—a toxic spill, a horrific accident, an Erin Brockovichtype story. But the reality is that there are many class actions that do not seek monetary damages but are fighting to right a systemic wrong in our society. These class actions have made lasting changes to our legal system and society that have moved our country closer to equality and justice, landmark class actions such as: Brown v. Board of Education, ending separate but equal as a basis for racial segregation in our schools; Allen v. State Board of Elections, finding that section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires preclearance of any changes in voting practices; and Alexander v. Holmes County School District, requiring immediate integration of the schools. In these cases, plaintiffs asked the courts to protect and preserve their constitutional rights for themselves and others in similar situations in the future. Under the system set forward by H.R. 985, a court would have to also set a dollar value to the judgment. How do you place a price tag on desegregating our Nation’s public schools? How do you place a price tag on protecting the right to vote? How do you put a price tag on preserving the Constitution’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel? How do you put a price tag on the fundamental right of marriage? It is not possible. These are fundamental, constitutional rights, and these rights are priceless. If this bill were to become law, courts and civil cases would become bogged down in ancillary litigation aimed at establishing the value of rights, rights that are protected through equitable and injunctive relief. It would be a mess, and we don’t have to make this unforced error. I oppose the underlying bill, but it is my sincere hope that, if the House is going to pass it, the least that we can do is remove this provision from the bill and end this insulting pretense that the courts or anyone else can put a dollar value on our constitutional freedoms. I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be defeated. Insofar as a class action seeks equitable relief, that is, the nonmonetary relief, including any injunctive relief that seeks to stop the defendant from doing something wrong, the portion of any class action lawyer’s fee should be limited to a reasonable percentage of the value of that relief as determined by the court. This provision won’t affect fee awards in civil rights cases because both the monetary and equitable relief attorney’s fees provision in this bill are qualified with the initial phrase, ‘‘unless otherwise specified by Federal statute.’’ The Civil Rights Attorney’s Fee Award Act of 1976 allows a court, in its discretion, to award reasonable attorney’s fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party in Federal civil rights lawsuits, including cases brought under 28 U.S.C. section 1983, the statute most commonly used to assert civil rights claims. Consequently, this bill won’t affect attorney’s fees in civil rights class actions at all. Regarding other equitable relief cases that don’t involve civil rights claims, Federal courts routinely determine the value of intangible relief such 
as equitable or injunctive relief for purposes of determining whether the amount in controversy requirement— currently, $75,000 to get into court—is met. A majority of courts consider only the value of the injunctive relief from the plaintiff’s perspective or viewpoint. Some courts determine the jurisdictional amount by evaluating the claim from the perspective of the party seeking Federal court jurisdiction. Others have adopted the ‘‘either viewpoint’’ rule, which allows the court to look to either the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s viewpoint in establishing the amount in controversy in cases seeking some form of injunctive relief. The bottom line is that, under this bill, Federal courts will be able to use either approach in deciding the value of the injunctive relief provided to class members; and generally speaking, counsel should be paid on the basis of what lawyers actually deliver to their clients. This base bill, of course, does not alter in any way the relief that would be granted to equitable relief class action members. It only limits the fees attorneys would receive to a reasonable percentage of the value of what the class members actually received. So all this amendment would do would be to put more money in the hands of lawyers and less in the hands of victims. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, section 1983 that my friend, the chairman, refers to as to providing attorney’s fees, requires a determination of attorney’s fees by the number of hours reasonably expended on litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly fee. b1700 This bill is very different from that. Instead of referring to hours and an hourly rate reasonably spent by an attorney, this bill requires the court to establish the value of the actual, equitable, or injunctive relief. As I have suggested already, I cannot think of anyone who would believe that we should leave it up to a court to put a value on our constitutional rights that are, without question, priceless in our democracy. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this good amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, constitutional rights are priceless, but attorney’s fees have to be set by the court. Who else is going to set them in those cases? I want to correct the gentleman, again, on this point about section 1983 cases because this bill says very clearly: unless otherwise specified by Federal statute. So this bill is not affected by the very example that he cites because that is something that is otherwise specified by Federal statute. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this needless and harmful amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . SOTO 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part B of House Report 115–29. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 8, strike line 7 and all that follows through line 14 (and amend the amendment to the table of contents on page 9 after line 3 accordingly). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike section 1721 of this Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2017. The irony of section 1721 is it unfairly subjects class action plaintiffs to an inevitable deluge of prolonged delay. A stay of discovery means no depositions. It means injured people will not get essential documents. It means victims will not be entitled to the names of necessary witnesses and more as long as a motion that may dispose of the case is pending. There is nothing to prevent a corporation from filing motion after motion to obstruct a victim’s path to justice. Numerous consumer, civil rights, environmental, labor, and other public interest groups oppose this bill because it builds in an automatic stay of discovery in the district court whenever an alleged wrongdoer files any one of a list of motions, including common motions like a motion to strike, a motion to dismiss, and a motion to dispose of class action allegations. There will be no end to the filing of these motions. This is an invitation for gamesmanship and delay and will deprive judges of the ability to properly manage their cases. The framers of the bill want you to believe that plaintiffs are greedy, undeserving people who want to hinder small business. This could not be further from the truth. If there are big settlements, it is because the damage to the victims was heinous. Is there any doubt that huge corporations would file motion after motion to obstruct these victims from getting the facts they need? Class actions are critical for enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, education, and access to public areas and services. At the end of the day, if we are trying to reduce litigation, why have this glaring loophole where someone continues to file motions to stop ordinary discovery from going forward? Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. BYRNE ). The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be rejected. The discovery process—the pretrial process in a lawsuit in which trial lawyers demand documents and other things from the people they are suing—imposes huge costs on defendants, particularly because of the astronomical costs associated with the discovery of electronic information, such as emails. Law Technology News has reported that the total cost of electronic discovery rose from $2 billion in 2006 to $2.8 billion in 2009 and estimated that the total cost would rise 10 to 15 percent annually over the next few years. In a more recent case study of Fortune 500 companies, the RAND Institute found that the median total cost for electronic discovery among participants totaled $1.8 million per case. These costs are asymmetric. While defendants typically are subject to gigantic discovery costs, because they are large organizations possessing large amounts of data, plaintiffs have little information in their possession, and, therefore, are subject to a very small financial burden during the discovery process. Moreover, discovery conducted before a motion to dismiss is decided is unfair. Why should defendants bear the burden of paying for discovery before a complaint is held legally sufficient, especially when the threat of huge costs may coerce an unjustified settlement? The reality for most civil litigation is that the defendants’ obligation to bear these exorbitant discovery costs incentivizes plaintiffs to serve burdensome discovery requests on defendants with zero downside risk to themselves. As professor Martin Redish has explained: ‘‘The fact that a party’s opponents will have to bear the financial burden of preparing the discovery response actually gives litigants an incentive to make discovery requests, and the bigger expense to be borne by the opponent, the bigger incentive to make the request.’’ Because defendants seek to avoid these exorbitant costs, discovery is all too often used as a weapon to coerce settlement of claims regardless of their 
merit. Even the Supreme Court has recognized this problem, lamenting that the threat of discovery expense will push costconscious defendants to settle even anemic cases before reaching trial. For example, assume that a defendant moves to dismiss a class action because it doesn’t assert any valid claims. Under current law, the named plaintiff can serve massive discovery requests that force defendants to spend $10 million to collect the requested documents. A rational decision for that defendant is to settle the case for millions, even if 4 months later the court grants the motion to dismiss, finding the class claims to be totally without merit. That is because, without a stay in discovery, the defendants will, in the meantime, have been required to spend all or part of the $10 million costs complying with the discovery requests for, it turns out, no legitimate reason. Trial lawyers pursue discovery in this circumstance primarily in an effort to pressure the defendant to settle invalid claims. The subsection of the bill entitled ‘‘Stay of discovery’’ would stop the use of discovery to coerce unjustified settlements by requiring Federal courts to stay discovery pending resolution of rule 12 motions—that is, motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim— motions to strike class allegations, motions to transfer, and other motions that would dispose of class allegations unless the court finds that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to a party. Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be defeated, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, even if we included motions to dismiss in the stay, which are at the beginning of the case because they are dispositive motions, there are still motions to strike that are left in this bill. After surviving a motion to dismiss, motions to strike are regularly filed. Anybody who has had any time in the courtroom know they can be filed over and over and over again. There is no limit of them under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. So simply by filing motion to strike after motion to strike, a defendant can continue to delay justice; and justice delayed is justice denied. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman will be pleased to know that tomorrow we will consider on the floor of this House legislation that, under rule XI, would impose mandatory sanctions on attorneys who engage in the type of activity he just described. That is an abuse as well. It will be covered by that legislation. But this legislation is appropriate to make sure that justice is done in class action litigation. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . JOHNSON OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part B of House Report 115–29. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 8, line 21, insert after ‘‘Civil Procedure.’’ the following (and amend the amendment to the table of contents on page 9 after line 3 accordingly): ‘‘§ 1724. Applicability ‘‘Sections 1716 through 1723 shall not apply in the case of any civil action alleging fraud.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, my amendment ensures the draconian class action rules created by H.R. 985 do not apply to cases alleging fraud. Corporate malfeasance and fraudulent practices are an ongoing problem facing American consumers. We saw this firsthand with the recent Wells Fargo case. In response to the company creating over 2 million phony bank and credit card accounts, thousands of account holders certified as a class to hold Wells Fargo accountable in court. However, under H.R. 985’s new requirements, this class action would have been stopped dead in its tracks at the certification phase. This is because the bill does not clearly define exactly how similar the scope and how similar the type of injury a class member must suffer. Since each individual Wells Fargo account holder endured varying degrees of financial harm from the company’s unauthorized actions, it is unclear if the victims would be considered a class under these new rules. The Volkswagen Dieselgate scandal is another example of a fraud case that would be at risk under these new rules. The German company defrauded thousands of consumers by selling cars that did not meet EPA emissions standards. The cars were, instead, fitted with illegal defeat software, which allowed them to pass routine emissions tests while still producing up to 35 times the legal limits of nitrogen oxides. A new MIT study found that the excess emissions generated by these cars between 2008 and 2015 will cause 1,200 premature deaths in Europe and 60 in the United States. This is in addition to the thousands of consumers who faced financial loss because they owned these defective vehicles that they could not trade in or sell. As part of the class action settlement, consumers were able to recoup their losses through a buyback program. As currently drafted, H.R. 985 would have made such a settlement unlikely because of the restrictions on cases involving financial injuries. Finally, we have the notorious and infamous Trump University class action. Class certification was granted for the thousands of students who were hurt by the President’s allegedly fraudulent forprofit scheme. Over 7,000 students were eligible for the class action because they were cheated into thinking they would become the next big real estate mogul. Instead, students lost thousands of dollars and wasted valuable time at this joke of a school. To avoid any admission of wrongdoing or face an embarrassing trial, the President and the nowdefunct Trump University opted for a $25 million settlement. Because of the impossible certification requirements in H.R. 985, it is safe to assume that Trump University’s lawyers would have had a field day dismantling this class action from the very beginning of the litigation. Earlier this week, it was reported in The New York Times that one of the students is opting out of the settlement, and if this bill passes, the risk will be that the class action could fall apart to the benefit of President Trump. b1715 Knowing how litigious our President is, this outcome is highly likely, as H.R. 985 applies not just to future cases but, suspiciously, pending ones as well—an almost unheard of clause to include in legislation. We cannot allow corporations, whether foreign or domestic, whether controlled by an unnamed board or by the President of the United States, to defraud consumers without facing accountability. My amendment looks to protect Americans in such cases and allows them to move forward in the courts as part of a class action. Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would subject certain class members to unfair treatment and should be rejected. The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of evaluating like 
claims, not to provide a means of artificially inflating the size of a class to extort a larger settlement value. Exempting a subset of cases from the bill, as this amendment would do, would serve only to incentivize the creation of artificially large classes to extort larger and unfair settlements from innocent parties for the purpose of disproportionately awarding uninjured parties. Why should only the claimants covered by the amendment be subject to particularly unfair treatment by being allowed to be forced into a class action with other uninjured or minimally injured members, only to see their own compensation reduced? This does a disservice to those claimants. Yet, that is exactly what this amendment would do. Regardless of the subject matter, class action plaintiffs are increasingly inclined to include fraud claims in their complaints. If they are suing about an allegedly defective product, they will add fraud claims, alleging that the manufacturer committed fraud by not disclosing the defect. If they are suing for a breach of contract, they will add fraud allegations, saying that the defendant didn’t disclose the alleged breach, and so on and so forth. Thus, this amendment would effectively gut the entire bill, since, to avoid its important reforms, class action lawyers would simply add fraud claims to their complaints, as they are increasingly prone to do in any event. Regarding the Volkswagen case, some opponents have urged that, if enacted, the base bill would have prevented the filing of the class actions related to the Volkswagen diesel emission controversy. Those assertions are false. This bill’s injury provision would be readily satisfied in the VW cases, as class members presumably would argue that they have been injured by their purchase of vehicles with noncompliant emission systems. Further, if the scope or type of injury differed among class members, separate class actions could be filed for each group, as actually occurred with respect to differing models in the Volkswagen MDL proceeding. The bill’s requirement about class representative disclosures would be easily satisfied. Many class members are interested in the litigation and presumably ready to serve as conflictfree class representatives who would not run afoul of these provisions. The bill’s ascertainability provisions would pose no obstacles because vehicle registration records would provide reliable class member lists and counsel could easily demonstrate a method to get any relief to class members. Requiring that payment of counsel fees await distribution of class benefits and that fees reflect a reasonable percentage of benefits actually received by class members would not impede bringing such cases. The cases would be litigated without resort to issues classes. Disclosure of any thirdparty litigation funding of the class actions wouldn’t preclude such cases. The provision doesn’t prohibit such funding. Only disclosure is required. Staying discovery while motions to dismiss are pending also poses no roadblock. Mr. Chairman, again, I urge my colleagues to defeat this gutting amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, protecting big, multinational corporations from fraud claims is not only unfair, it is odious. If you can’t hold a big, multinational corporation accountable for fraud, then your money is at risk, your health is at risk, and the lives of innocent people are at risk. Mr. Chairman, I ask that all of my colleagues support this amendment, which protects the American people from fraud. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I would just say to the gentleman that there is nothing in this bill that would restrict access to class actions based upon fraud claims. And in fact, this bill is designed to maximize the recovery for those fraud victims, rather than lining the pockets of attorneys. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . CONYERS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part B of House Report 115–29. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 8, line 25, insert after ‘‘Civil Procedure.’’ the following (and amend the amendment to the table of contents on page 9 after line 3 accordingly): ‘‘§ 1724. Applicability ‘‘Sections 1716 through 1723 shall not apply in the case of any civil action alleging a violation of a civil right.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which would exempt H.R. 985’s unnecessary and burdensome class action provisions all class actions asserting civil rights claims. Class actions are an important litigation tool that consumers, workers, and anyone else who has suffered injury can use to vindicate their rights. They are also a critical mechanism for enforcing public policy and are especially key in the enforcement of Federal civil rights laws. For instance, plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases who seek backpay because of an adverse employment decision often pursue class actions because such cases tend to be the kind that are wellsuited for class treatment. These cases typically concern multiple victims who were subjected to the same discriminatory employment practice or policy. While damages awarded pursuant to a single plaintiff may not be large enough to deter the employer’s alleged wrongdoing, aggregate damages awarded to plaintiffs as a result of class action would have a deterrent effect. Unfortunately, this bill, H.R. 985, requires class action plaintiffs to prove at the certification stage that every potential class member suffered the same type and same scope of injury, a requirement that is obviously virtually impossible and cost prohibitive to meet. This onerous requirement would effectively deter employment discrimination and other civil rights plaintiffs from proceeding with any class action. As if this provision were not onerous enough, H.R. 985 would also harm civil rights plaintiffs by making it virtually impossible to pursue class actions pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. All Federal appeals courts interpret that provision as allowing courts to certify a class limited to one issue in a case, such as liability, without having to certify a putative class for the entire cause of action. Allowing courts to decide common questions within a case, while permitting other issues to be determined on an individual basis, would promote judicial efficiency, which is also one of the principal benefits of class actions. H.R. 985, however, would prohibit certification of such ‘‘issue’’ class actions unless the putative class for the entire cause of action is certified, which would only further delay and possibly deny justice for plaintiffs. This provision would have a particularly devastating impact on civil rights class actions that often can only be maintained as to particular issues, such as liability. Indeed, for these, and many other reasons, including the bill’s mandatory appeals provision, its automatic stay of discovery, and its draconian and unworkable standards for setting attorneys’ fees, 123 civil rights groups and organizations have written a letter to the Judiciary Committee in strong opposition to H.R. 985, which I include in the RECORD . 
MARCH 7, 2017. Re Strong Opposition to H.R. 985—Section 2. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : We understand that the House will soon consider H.R. 985, the ‘‘Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2015.’’ The 123 signatory civil rights organizations and advocates write to strongly oppose Section 2 of H.R. 985. The bill will undermine the enforcement of this nation’s civil rights laws and upend decades of settled class action law. This sweeping and poorly drafted legislation will create needless chaos in the courts without actually solving any demonstrated problem. In this letter, we highlight the most egregious of its many harms. As advocates for the marginalized and often invisible members of our society, we write to remind House members that class actions are critical for the enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, education, and access to public areas and services. As the Supreme Court has recognized, class actions provide ‘‘vindication of the rights of groups of people who individually would be without effective strength to bring their opponents into court at all.’’ Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997). Courts have interpreted Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the federal class action rule, over decades and the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules has, through its deliberative process, reviewed and amended the rule to ensure its fair and efficient operation. No further revisions are needed at this time. 
EXPENSE , AND DISRUPTION  One of the stated purposes of the bill is to ‘‘assure . . . prompt recoveries,’’ yet it includes provisions that will extend the duration of cases by years and add exponentially to the expense on both sides. The bill allows for an automatic appeal—in the middle of every case—of the class certification order. Such appeals are extraordinarily disruptive and typically add one to three years to the life of the case. While the case sits in an appellate court, expenses and fees rise, memories fade, and injured victims remain without justice. Automatic appeals of all class certification orders will clog our alreadytaxed Courts of Appeals. Appeals of class certification rulings are already permitted at the discretion of the Courts of Appeals. An appeal of every class certification ruling is unnecessary. The bill similarly builds in an automatic stay of discovery in the district court whenever an alleged wrongdoer files any one of a list of motions. This is an invitation for gamesmanship and delay, and will deprive judges of the ability to properly manage their cases. The bill, by its terms, applies to all cases pending upon the date of enactment. This means that hundreds of cases that have been litigated and certified under existing law would start from scratch with new standards, new class certification motions, and new automatic interlocutory appeals. The resulting waste of judicial resources would be enormous. 
AND ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS JU DICIAL REVIEW  H.R. 985 imposes a new and impossible hurdle for class certification. It requires that the proponents of the class demonstrate that ‘‘each class member has suffered the same type and scope of injury.’’ At this early stage of a civil rights class action, it is frequently impossible to identify all of the victims or the precise nature of each of their injuries. But even if this information were knowable, class members’ injuries would not be ‘‘the same.’’ As a simple example, those overcharged for rent will have different injuries. In an employment discrimination class action, the extent of a class member’s injuries will depend on a range of factors, including their job position, tenure, employment status, salary, and length of exposure to the discriminatory conditions. For this reason, nearly forty years ago, the Supreme Court developed a twostage process for such cases in International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. U.S., 431 U.S. 324, 371–72 (1977). In the first stage, the court determines whether the employer engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination. If the employer is found liable, the court holds individual hearings to determine the relief (if any) for each victim. The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the use of the Teamsters model for discrimination class actions in part because of the individualized nature of injuries. WalMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 366 (2011). Thus, this bill would overturn the approach established four decades ago to permit a class of victims of discrimination to seek effective relief. For the same reason, the bill’s limitation on ‘‘issue classes’’ will impede the enforcement of civil rights laws. Under current practice, the district court will decide in some cases that the best approach is to resolve the illegality of a discriminatory practice in an initial proceeding, and then allow class members to pursue individual remedies on their own. In such cases, class certification for the core question of liability (often a complex proceeding) will be tried and resolved just once for the benefit of the many affected individuals. These issue classes can promote both efficiency and fairness. Section 1720, however, would deprive courts of this ability that they currently have to manage class actions to ensure justice. REQUIRING THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF  
CLASS MEMBERS IS UNNECESSARY  Section 1718 seeks to impose a heightened standard for identifying class members, an approach that has been rejected by the majority of circuits to have considered the question. This stringent standard would not further any interest that is not already adequately protected by Rule 23, which requires that the court consider whether the case is manageable and the class action device is the ‘‘superior’’ method for fairly and efficiently resolving the case. Moreover, §1718 would impose a nearly insurmountable hurdle in situations where a class action is the only viable way to pursue valid but lowvalue claims. In such cases, records of who has been affected may have been destroyed by the wrongdoer, may be incomplete, or may have never existed at all. In those cases, individual notice to all class members may be impossible. But, without class certification in these situations, class members who have valid claims and who can be identified would not be allowed to recover. The bill also ignores the important objective of deterring and punishing wrongdoing, and encourages defendants not to maintain relevant records. 
ENFORCEMENT  Civil rights class actions are often about systemic reforms that benefit the most vulnerable. In many cases, the sole remedy is an injunction to change illegal laws or practices. To ensure that nonprofit legal organizations and other advocates are able to undertake these important, complex, and often risky cases, dozens of our civil rights laws incorporate feeshifting provisions. If a case is successful, the judge awards a reasonable fee based upon the time that the advocates have spent working on the case. This method of determining attorneys’ fees provides for consistent and predictable outcomes, which is a benefit to all parties in a lawsuit. H.R. 985 would entirely displace this well settled law with a standard long ago rejected as arbitrary and unworkable. Under the bill, attorneys’ fees would be calculated as a ‘‘percentage of the value of the equitable relief.’’ §1718(b)(3). But how is a judge to determine the cash value of an integrated school, a welloperating foster care system, the deinstitutionalization of individuals with disabilities, or myriad other forms of equitable relief secured by civil rights class actions? Asking judges to assign a price tag in such cases is an impossible task and would lead to uncertainty and inconsistency. Nonprofit organizations cannot bear the risk of these long and expensive cases if, at the end, their fees are calculated under this incoherent and capricious standard. Indeed, the bill creates an incentive for defendants to prolong the litigation so as to make it economically impossible for plaintiffs’ attorneys to continue to prosecute the litigation. These serious issues warrant, at a minimum, careful consideration and public hearings. A rush to pass such farreaching and flawed legislation will deny access to justice for many and undermine the rule of law. Respectfully Submitted, JOCELYN D. L ARKIN , Executive Director, Impact Fund.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, with great deference and respect to my friend and colleague, the ranking member, this amendment would subject certain class members to unfair treatment and, thus, should be rejected. First, the bill’s provisions on type and scope of injury only apply to proposed classes ‘‘seeking monetary relief for personal injury or economic loss.’’ Insofar as civil rights cases do not seek money damages, they are completely unaffected by the bill and would proceed just as they do today. However, if money damages are sought by a proposed class, then, of course, they should be subject to the procedures in the bill. The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of evaluating like claims, not to provide a means of artificially inflating the size of a class to extort a larger settlement value. Exempting a subset of money damage cases from the bill, as this amendment would do, would serve only to incentivize the creation of artificially large classes to extort larger and unfair settlements from innocent parties for the purpose of disproportionately awarding uninjured parties. Any claims seeking monetary relief for personal injury or economic loss should be grouped in classes in which those who are the most injured receive the most compensation. Why should civil rights claimants seeking money damages be subject to particularly unfair treatment by being allowed to be forced into a class action with other uninjured or minimally injured members, only to see their own compensation reduced? That does a disservice to those claimants. Yes, that is exactly what this amendment would do. Further, the bill’s provision on attorneys’ fees won’t affect fee awards in civil rights cases at all because both the monetary and equitable relief attorneys’ fees provision in the bill are qualified with the initial phrase ‘‘unless otherwise specified by Federal statute.’’ The Civil Rights Attorney’s Fee Award Act of 1976 allows a court, in its discretion, to award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party in Federal civil rights lawsuits, including cases brought under 28 U.S.C. section 1983, the statute most commonly used to assert civil rights claims. Consequently, this bill will not affect attorneys’ fees in civil rights class actions at all, including, of course, cases brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has its own attorneys’ fees provision. The conflicts of interest provision reflects a valid concern in all class actions. The courts need to know how the named plaintiffs came to be involved in class actions in all types of cases to ensure there aren’t conflicts and that the due process rights of all class members are protected. The issues class provision won’t disrupt the manner in which civil rights cases are normally litigated. Discovery stays while dispositive motions are pending won’t disrupt civil rights cases. Like any other case, the plaintiffs need to show they have a facially valid complaint before discovery should commence. Disclosure of thirdparty funding is no less important in civil rights cases than in other class actions. The appeals provision benefits both plaintiffs and defendants, giving either side the right to appeal if class certification is granted or denied. I urge all my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which would set back the just causes of civil rights claimants. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. b1730 The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MS . JACKSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in part B of House Report 115–29. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Beginning on page 13, strike line 19 and all that follows through line 15 on page 14, and insert the following: ‘‘(8) A trust described in paragraph (2) shall file with the bankruptcy court, not later than 60 days after the end of every quarter, a report that shall be made available on the court’s public docket and with respect to each such reporting period contains an aggregate list of demands received and an aggregate list of payments made.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I think the question is: Is there any collegiality and respect for the Federal judicial system? Let me read a letter in reference to the underlying bill: 
We strongly urge Congress not to amend the class action procedures found in rule 23 outside of the Rules Enabling Act process. 
It goes on to talk about an advisory committee, but I don’t know any sentence more clear than that. I know that as a parent raising a child, ‘‘do not’’ and ‘‘no’’ are very clear, yet we maintain this debate on the floor of the House. Let me also mention a debate that is tomorrow, but I think it is relevant to my amendment, LARA. This is a rule that was in in 1983. In 1993, it was thrown out because it had a deleterious effect on meritorious civil rights cases, employment cases, and others. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, that is tomorrow. The courts also don’t want you to do that, and most of the courts say it is a waste of resources. My amendment is going to help us solve the problem for this bill, H.R. 985. It would improve the rules of the committee print by replacing the substantive text of the bill with a requirement that the bankruptcy asbestos trust report quarterly an aggregate list of demands received and payments made. Specifically, the Jackson Lee amendment protects the privacy of asbestos victims from overly broad and invasive disclosure requirements by striking from the bill’s text personal information disclosure mandates. Mr. Chairman, the only beneficiaries of the socalled FACT Act are the very entities that knowingly produced a toxic substance that killed or seriously injured thousands of unsuspecting American consumers and workers—it is the defendants. And, no, it does not provide for a safety for the trust. Worse, this bill would allow victims of asbestos exposure to be further victimized by requiring information about their illness to be made publicly available to virtually anyone who has access to the internet. Once irretrievably released into the public domain, this information would be a virtual treasure trove for data collectors and other entities for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with the compensation for asbestos exposure. Why do these people have to be doubly, triply penalized? They are already dying, many of them. Insurance companies, prospective employers, lenders, predatory scam artists all have access to these unsuspecting and devastated families or victims. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chair, I wish to thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Rules Committee for making the Jackson Lee Amendment in order. Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee Amendment to Rules Committee Print 115–5 of H.R. 985, the ‘‘Fairness in Class Action Litigation And Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017.’’ My amendment would improve the Rules Committee Print 115–5 to H.R. 985 by replacing the substantive text of the bill with a requirement that the bankruptcy asbestos trust report quarterly an aggregate list of demands received and payments made. Specifically, the Jackson Lee Amendment protects the privacy of asbestos victim plaintiffs from overly broad and invasive disclosure requirements, by striking from the bill’s text personal information disclosure mandates. Mr. Chair, the only beneficiaries of the so called ‘‘FACT Act,’’ are the very entities that knowingly produced a toxic substance that killed or seriously injured thousands of unsuspecting American consumers and workers. In fact, I am unaware of any asbestos victim who supports this legislation. Worse yet, this bill would allow victims of asbestos exposure to be further victimized by requiring information about their illness to be made publicly available to virtually anyone who has access to the Internet. For example, the bill requires all payment demands, as well as, the names and exposure histories of each claimant together with the basis for any payment the trust made to such claimants to be publicly disclosed. This sensitive information must be posted on the court’s public docket, which is easily accessible through the Internet with the payment of a nominal file. Once irretrievably released into the public domain, this information would be a virtual treasure trove for data collectors and other entities for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with compensation for asbestos exposure. Insurance companies, prospective employers, lenders, and predatory scam artists as well as the victim’s neighbors would have access to this information. To address this serious failing of the bill, my amendment would ensure that the quarterly reports required under the ‘‘FACT Act,’’ contain only aggregate payment information. My amendment also deletes the bill’s burdensome discovery requirement. As noted by the widow of our former colleague Representative Bruce Vento who passed away from asbestosinduced mesothelioma, the bill’s public disclosure of victims’ private information: ‘‘could be used to deny employment, credit, and health, life, and disability insurance.’’ Mrs. Vento also warned that asbestos victims ‘‘would be more vulnerable to identity thieves, con men, and other types of predators.’’ I am sure that the supporters of this legislation will say that Bankruptcy Code section 107 will prevent such results. But this provision only permits—it does not require—the bankruptcy court to issue a protective order. In fact, such relief may only be granted ‘‘for cause’’ if the court finds that ‘‘disclosure of such information would create undue risk of identity theft or other unlawful injury to the individual.’’ What this means is that an asbestos victim would have to retain counsel and go to court in order to prove ‘‘cause’’ to obtain relief. And, even though Bankruptcy Rule 9037 does require certain types of personal information to be redacted from a document filed in a bankruptcy case, said Rule would be overridden by this legislation, as written. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment to ensure that the privacy of asbestos victims is protected. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, the FACT Act is designed to require increased transparency to combat fraud committed against asbestos trusts. This amendment strikes the requirement that asbestos trusts publish the very data that is necessary to detect fraud between the trusts and State tort proceedings. In its place, this amendment calls for only a quarterly report with an aggregate list of demands received by the trusts. The simple aggregation of information is worthless in allowing parties to make a meaningful inquiry into whether or not they are being defrauded. This amendment guts the bill, and I urge opposition. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on my side? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me say whose side I want to stand on, and that is the side of Mrs. Vento, the widow of our former colleague, Representative Bruce Vento, who passed away from asbestosinduced cancer. The bill’s public disclosure of victims’ private information could be used to deny employment, credit, and health, life, and disability insurance. Mrs. Vento also warned that asbestos victims would be more vulnerable to identity thieves, con men, and other types of predators. There is no reason for this bill. Not only is the Judicial Conference of Federal Judges against it, but victims are crying out: Stop it, and stop it now. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I include in the RECORD a StarTribune article. 
[From the StarTribune] STAND WITHFAMILIES AFFECTED BY  ASBESTOS , ANDHELPKILLFACT A CT My husband was the late U.S. Rep. Bruce F. Vento, who served for almost 24 years in the House of Representatives representing Minnesota’s Fourth Congressional District. He died from mesothelioma in 2000 within eight and a half months of being diagnosed. Mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer caused by asbestos exposure. Bruce was exposed while working his way through college as a laborer, years before he became involved in public life. With his death, our country lost a hardworking and humble public servant years before his time. Bruce’s parents, siblings, children, grandchildren and I lost so much more. Since his death, I have worked with asbestos patients and family members from across the country to fight for a ban on asbestos and to protect the rights of people whose lives have been forever affected by this terrible poison. I have recently been involved in the effort to stop the socalled ‘‘Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency Act,’’ or FACT Act, which would obstruct justice for victims dying from asbestosrelated diseases while giving a handout to the very corporations that knowingly poisoned and killed them. The FACT Act would require that the personal information of sick and dying asbestos patients and their families be posted on a public website, including names, addresses, medical diagnoses, financial compensation received and the last four digits of our Social Security numbers. This is precisely the kind of information that law enforcement officials tell the public we should not share on the Internet because it leaves us vulnerable to identity thieves and con artists. The House could be considering a vote on this bad legislation in the coming weeks, making it all the more urgent that we act now to protect the privacy of asbestos victims and their families. Supporters of the FACT Act are the corporations that exposed innocent workers, consumers and their family members to asbestos, while concealing what they knew about this dangerous poison. They claim that this gross violation of our privacy is necessary in order to protect asbestos patients from fraud against the asbestos trust funds that were set up to compensate asbestos victims and their families. Yet, not a single instance of fraud against the trust funds has been identified. What is worse, while the bill’s supporters claim that they are doing it for asbestos victims, not one victim of asbestos exposure or an affected family member has been allowed to be heard on this legislation. The only people who would be directly affected by the bill have been completely shut out of the process. The FACT Act would also bog down the asbestos trust funds in endless paperwork to respond to information requests from asbestos companies. This would drain the funds of money that is desperately needed to compensate sick and dying victims. As the victims get more and more desperate, they will be willing to settle cases for pennies on the dollar, taking needed compensation away from families and leaving it in the pockets of the responsible companies. I recently traveled to Washington, D.C., and met with Sens. Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar and Rep. Betty McCollum, all of whom committed to work with asbestos patients and family members to stop the FACT Act from becoming law. I hope that we can count on the rest of Minnesota’s congressional delegation to stand with asbestos patients and families and against the FACT Act. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, without having the ability to hear my colleague’s opposition, I know that the supporters of this legislation will say that Bankruptcy Code section 107 will prevent these devastating results, but it is not true. This provision only permits it. It does not require the bankruptcy court to issue a protective order. My amendment protects these vulnerable victims against the release of their data, making them, in addition to the devastating disease that they got from asbestos—and our good friend Bruce Vento, many of us knew Congressman Vento, we knew his wife, and we knew that his death was both untimely and devastating, and now you are saying to victims like him: Release all the data. Open yourself up to more. Open your families up to more. The Jackson Lee amendment is a commonsense amendment that will provide for an asbestos trust report quarterly, an aggregate list of demands received and payments made. As well, it would protect the privacy of asbestos victim plaintiffs from overly broad and invasive disclosure requirements by striking down the bill’s text about personal information disclosure mandates. No matter what my good friend from Texas says, he does not have an answer to protecting the privacy of these victims. I ask our colleagues to support a commonsense response. Stop it now. The courts don’t want it, and it is horrible for the victims. It is doubling down on people who have lost loved ones and victims who are suffering from asbestosinduced cancer. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, the FACT Act requires that a very basic amount of information be released to protect against fraud against the asbestos trust system. I am standing with future victims of asbestos. The diseases associated with asbestos typically don’t manifest themselves for decades, in some cases, beyond or after exposure. These trusts are being drained by fraudulent and duplicative claims. These requirements of disclosure prevent that fraud by requiring the minimal amount of information being required. In fact, a judge with 29 years of bench experience testified before the Committee on the Judiciary that the FACT Act provides more protection in terms of confidentiality of records than the legal system is able to do. This is commonsense legislation, does not invade people’s privacy, and preserves these trust funds to make sure all victims are compensated. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON  LEE). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MR . ESPAILLAT  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in part B of House Report 115–29. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 13, line 21, insert ‘‘subject to subparagraph (C),’’ after ‘‘(A)’’. Page 14, line 6, strike ‘‘and’’ at the end. Page 14, line 7, insert ‘‘subject to subparagraph (C),’’ after ‘‘(B)’’. Page 14, line 15, strike the close quotation marks and the period at the end, and insert ‘‘; and’’. Page 14, after line 15, insert the following: ‘‘(C) not comply with subparagraphs (A) and (B) with respect to such claimant who is or has been living in public housing (as such term is defined in section 3(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b))) or any dwelling unit for which rental assistance is provided under section 8 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f).’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017. My amendment would exempt a claimant who is or has been living in public housing or any dwelling unit for which rental assistance was provided under the Section 8 housing program. While I firmly believe that every individual should be exempt from this outrageous provision, my amendment recognizes that we, the Federal Government, are the landlords, the owners, if you may, of public housing. Speaker RYANis a landlord of public housing. Our leader, the gentlewoman from California, is a landlord of public housing. The President is a tenant of public housing. The White House is public housing. While the White House has hot water, a nice roof, and likely no asbestos, it is still public housing. We, the taxpayers, pay the rent. We, as the Federal Government on both sides of the aisle, are the owners and the landlords of public housing. As the owners of public housing, we have a unique obligation to the people living in these units. We are responsible for the dilapidated conditions of 
our public housing units, and we are responsible for the health and wellbeing of lowincome tenants living in them. Much of our public housing was built in the 1950s and 1960s, coinciding with what was perhaps the peak time for the use of asbestoscontaining products in building and construction materials. This has left thousands of our most vulnerable citizens at risk of exposure to asbestos, which has killed as many as 15,000 Americans each year. People who have a legitimate claim and have been exposed to asbestos while living in either public housing or Section 8 housing should be afforded the due process they deserve and given the opportunity to bring their claims in a timely manner. I think this entire bill is a misnomer and should be renamed the unfairness in class action litigation act. No one—no one—should have their due process rights delayed or denied. There is no doubt that the consequences of this legislation will be especially and uniquely detrimental to lowincome individuals. This legislation will completely upend privacy and bankruptcy laws. As it stands today, our laws guarantee that a claimant’s information is protected. This bill, however, will require that an individual claimant’s personal information and the amount they have received from the trust be made available on a public website. Not only is this a complete and total disregard for the individual’s privacy, but it makes the most vulnerable in our society prey for financial predators. My amendment will guarantee that tenants living in public housing and Section 8 housing are not subjected to such an outrageous shift in privacy rights. The bill sends trusts on a wild goose chase for information that may not even be there, while they should be spending their time working through the pending claims. These companies hid the dangers of asbestos for decades, for far too long, and there is absolutely no reason why we should be helping them now. Rather than wasting time and taxpayer dollars obstructing the judicial system, we should be focusing on initiatives that will update our crumbling infrastructure. And, yes, public housing is undoubtedly infrastructure. Finally, the CBO has indicated that, financially, this amendment will cost nothing. This amendment will cost absolutely nothing. But I can promise you that not adopting it will come at a great cost to our system of justice. I ask my colleagues to adopt this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prevent asbestos trusts from disclosing claims information submitted by individuals living in public housing in its quarterly reports and in response to information requests. There is no reason to distinguish between the disclosure obligations of individuals living in public housing and the disclosure obligations of ordinary citizens. To the extent that claimants do not affirmatively identify themselves as living in public housing, this amendment would require asbestos trusts to determine whether claimants qualify in these categories, further draining them of funds needed to compensate future victims. The FACT Act balances the need for transparency and protecting claimants’ privacy. The FACT Act excludes any confidential medical records and the claimants’ Social Security numbers. We should ensure that bankruptcy asbestos claims are processed in an open, fair, and transparent method in order to protect the limited amount of money reserved for compensating future asbestos victims. b1745 The FACT Act should apply uniformly to all claimants, and it should not impose disparate burdens relating to individuals living in public housing. Mr. Chairman, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in part B of House Report 115– 29 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order: Amendment No. 2 by Mr. DEUTCH of Florida. Amendment No. 3 by Mr. DEUTCH of Florida. Amendment No. 4 by Mr. SOTO of Florida. Amendment No. 5 by Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Amendment No. 6 by Mr. CONYERS of Michigan. Amendment No. 7 by Ms. JACKSON  LEEof Texas. Amendment No. 8 by Mr. ESPAILLAT  of New York. The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote after the first vote in this series. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . DEUTCH  
The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the noes prevailed by voice vote.

The Acting CHAIR (during the vote). There is 1 minute remaining. b1828 So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ) having assumed the chair, Mr. BYRNE , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 985) to amend the procedures used in Federal court class actions and multidistrict litigation proceedings to assure fairer, more efficient outcomes for claimants and defendants, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 180, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on the amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. KILDEE. I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Kildee moves to recommit the bill H.R. 985 to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Page 13, insert after line 10 the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): 
Nothing in this title or the amendments made by this title shall apply to any civil action brought to protect public drinking water supplies. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. My motion to recommit is quite simple. It exempts class action lawsuits that are brought to protect public water supplies. I know some of you have heard me speak of this. I am from Flint, Michigan, and we know, in my community, what happens when we fail to protect drinking water. In the course of the day, most Americans take for granted that water that comes from the tap is safe. But for my community of 100,000 people, that is not true. It hasn’t been true for years. Since the State government switched to a corrosive water source, the Flint River, they have not been able to drink water out of the tap. This terrible decision poisoned the city’s water supply with corrosive water, resulting in high levels of lead leaching into their water system, going into their pipes, into their homes, into their bodies, 100,000 people, 7,000 children under the age of 6. Nearly 3 years later, those same families are still reeling from this crisis. It is unacceptable. It is an injustice. Lead is a potent neurotoxin. There is no safe level of lead. Lead exposure can lead to serious health effects felt for years. But the impacts are not limited just to health. Those high levels of lead also damaged Flint’s infrastructure, and we now have to remove thousands of pipes in order to provide safe water. Thankfully, this Congress, Democrats and Republicans, came together to provide necessary help for my hometown to fix those pipes. But Flint residents will continue to suffer. That was important, but not enough. There are lots of health effects. Just recently we learned that many cases, in fact, many deaths that we thought were attributable to pneumonia, were, in fact, Legionnaires’ disease, traceable to the bacteria caused by this terrible crisis. A dozen people have already died as a result of Legionnaires’ disease, and others, whose deaths may be reclassified, could bring that number much higher. The corrosiveness of that water not only had health impacts, but it literally destroyed people’s homes from the inside out. So, in addition to those service lines, people’s plumbing in their homes, their water heaters, their washing machines destroyed, ruined, and their lives potentially ruined as well. So where does the support, where does the funding come for those losses experienced by residents of my hometown? It comes from the justice system. This bill would create more barriers for people in my hometown to access that justice system, to seek justice for what happened to them. They have suffered a terrible crisis, and they should be able to seek justice and restitution. Unfortunately, this bill could prevent people from Flint, and other Americans, from seeking justice, and that is what my motion intends to correct. In order to receive justice from the harm that they have experienced from this public water source, residents have filed class action suits. This bill severely curtails their access to the courts to seek redress, to seek that restitution. This bill would weaken their access to justice. My motion is simple. It would allow lawsuits that are brought to protect our precious public water supplies to be exempt from the additional hurdles, from the additional barriers that this underlying bill sets out. Having safe drinking water is a human right, and the access to that and the access to justice related to that basic human right ought to be completely unfettered. My motion to recommit would assure that, and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this motion. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, the base bill contains provisions that allow all claims to go forward as class actions and also maximize awards to deserving victims. Why would anyone want to single out safe drinking water victims for adverse treatment and deny them the benefits of the base bill that would maximize any recovery they might receive in a class action? This motion to recommit would do that, and it should be defeated. In closing, let me say that we know that only the tiniest fraction of consumer class action members ever bother to claim the compensation awarded them in a settlement. That is clear proof that the vast majority—the vast large numbers of class members are satisfied with the product they purchased. They don’t want compensation. They don’t want to be lumped into gigantic class action lawsuits. Federal judges are crying out for the Congress to reform the class action system, which currently allows trial lawyers to file classes with hundreds and thousands of unmeritorious claims and use those artificially inflated classes to force defendants to settle the case. As I have recounted, some class action settlements have left lawyers with millions in fees while the alleged victims receive absolutely nothing. This bill prevents people from being forced into class actions with other uninjured or minimally injured members, only to have the compensation of injured parties reduced. It requires that lawyer fees be limited to a reasonable percentage of the money injured victims actually receive. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this motion to recommit and supporting this bill on behalf of the consumers and injured parties everywhere. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5minute vote. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of passage.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.

Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. Kuster of New Hampshire moves to recommit the bill H.R. 725 to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Add, at the end of the bill, the following: 
SEC. 3. PROTECTING AMERICANS’ RIGHT TO HOLD GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO ETHICAL STANDARDS. 
Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act may be construed to apply to a civil action pertaining to ethics in government. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Today, our country is in an era where appropriate ethics and conduct by elected officials is of the utmost importance. I think we can agree that many representatives and others in government have failed to live up to the expectations of the American people. We all have immense responsibility to advocate for our constituents, and it is so important that our work and the work of those in this administration reflect our genuine desire to do well on the part of those we represent. I have heard from literally thousands of my constituents in New Hampshire who are concerned about the President’s reluctance to fully give up control of his businesses, his refusal to publicly disclose his tax returns, and the connections between Russia and those in his campaign and the administration. This pattern of nondisclosure and hidden interests in the administration could put our public welfare and, indeed, our national security at stake. Citizens must have all the legal tools at their disposal to push back against improper ethics and crony capitalism at all levels of government, including the highest levels of the Federal Government. This also includes instances in which a business could face unfair competition because conflicts of interest in government provide unfair support to their competitors. Unfortunately, the bill before us today makes it harder for those who may have been wronged by established and wellfunded interests to get a fair shot in court. My amendment simply states that nothing in this legislation shall be construed to apply to any civil action related to ethics in government. Private citizens trying to hold government officials to high ethical standards should not have barriers like this legislation thrown in their way. Going forward, I hope that as Republicans and Democrats we can work together to promote legislation and efforts that increase transparency in government, rather than making it more difficult for citizens to hold the government accountable. I ask that my colleagues support this important motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am not sure how this bill applies to government ethics at all. This bill is a simple bill that tells trial lawyers not to sue innocent local people in businesses just so they can forum shop. It tells them that all they have got to do is show a plausible case before they can proceed and that they have got to proceed in good faith. It has nothing to do with what the amendment proposes. This is to protect innocent folks from being sucked into lawsuits by trial lawyers. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.

b1919 So the bill was passed. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 610 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 610. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 637 Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 637. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina? There was no objection. 
APPOINTMENT OF MEMBER TO MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION COMMISSION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair announces the Speaker’s appointment, pursuant to section 2 of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 715a), and the order of the House of January 3, 2017, of the following Member on the part of the House to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission: Mr. THOMPSON , California 
RIGHT TO TRY POTENTIALLY LIFESAVING DRUGS (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, many Americans, including my constituents, fight a terminal illness. Many of them cannot access potentially lifesaving drugs because of the lengthy and bureaucratic Food and Drug Administration’s approval process. Last month Congressman FITZPATRICK and I introduced the Right to Try Act, which is a bill that would provide the option for terminally ill patients to receive drugs that have passed the FDA’s basic safety testing but are still working their way through the lengthy government process to receive final approval. In 2014, my home State of Arizona passed a similar righttotry law with nearly 80 percent of the vote, thanks to the heroic efforts of my friend, the late Laura Knaperek. She successfully fought to pass righttotry at the State level even as she was battling a cancer that would ultimately claim her life. I sponsored this bill in memory of Laura and many others who have championed this legislation around the country. Righttotry has passed in 33 States, and it needs to be enacted at the Federal level. Our bill gives Americans that right to try. I am grateful for Congressman FITZPATRICK ’s partnership on this vital issue. I call upon my colleagues to pass this legislation in the House. 
HEALTH CARE UNCERTAINTY IN NEW JERSEY (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say that the Republicans’ attack on the poor and vulnerable through this disastrous healthcare bill is a surprise. But, unfortunately, in my home State, Republican leadership has laid out the framework for their very own attack. Last week, Governor Chris Christie dealt another blow to the welfare of New Jerseyans by seeking to fund his State budget by siphoning money from Horizon, the State’s largest healthcare insurer, serving over 900,000 Medicaid members in New Jersey. Horizon’s reserve fund exists to protect healthcare consumers in the face of uncertainty. But, Mr. Speaker, New Jerseyans are currently facing tremendous uncertainty due to proposals by Republicans in Congress to roll back Medicaid. Mr. Speaker, the threats are clear. Governor Christie’s proposal would destabilize Horizon and raise consumer premiums just when hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans may lose Medicaid coverage or have premium subsidies withdrawn at the hands of reckless Federal lawmakers. In my district alone, 40,600 New Jerseyans currently covered by the ACA’s Medicaid expansion now stand to lose their coverage if eliminated. Both Governor Christie’s budget raid and the Republican healthcare proposal are prescriptions for disaster. These plans are not only lazy and careless, but are also unworkable strategies that will only result in chaos across the healthcare industry of New Jersey and this country. 
PENN STATE’S THON FUNDRAISER (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of Penn State’s finest events, THON, a 46hour dance marathon. THON began in 1977. It is the largest studentrun philanthropy in the world, and it raises money to fight pediatric cancer. THON ran from February 17 to 19 as dancers stood for 46 hours without sleep at Bryce Jordan Center. THON is a yearround fundraising and awareness campaign for the fight against childhood cancer, with proceeds going directly to Four Diamonds, which benefits the Penn State Children’s Hospital in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Four Diamonds ensures that families who are battling pediatric cancer are not faced with any costs, allowing them to fully focus on the needs of their child. THON 2017 raised more than $10 million, and since its inception, THON has raised more than $146 million. This truly is an event like none other. It shows the power of what Penn State students can do and have been doing to cover the treatment costs for pediatric cancer patients as well as support cancer research. Thank you to all the Penn State students who take part in this spectacular event. f 
FIX HEALTH CARE, DON’T DESTROY IT (Mr. CRIST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of strengthening the Affordable Care Act. Last Saturday, we held a townhall meeting in my home of St. Petersburg, Florida. Over 550 Pinellas County residents showed up, and the message was overwhelming: Work together, fix health care, don’t destroy it, put people above politics. The Republican bill unveiled this week would drive up healthcare costs, strip away important protections, and leave millions without coverage. It is wrong for senior citizens. It is wrong for women. It is wrong for the poor and the disabled. We are judged by how we treat the least among us. 
HONORING ZELL MILLER (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish the great Georgia Governor and U.S. Senator Zell Miller a happy 85th birthday. He celebrated his milestone on February 24, 2017. For his undergraduate education, Mr. Miller attended the University of Georgia as well as my alma mater, Young Harris College. He often compared Young Harris to a shoe factory because, as he says, you enter single but you leave as a pair. Fittingly, it is where Mr. Miller met his wife of more than 60 years, Shirley. Also fittingly, it is where I met my wife of 38 years, Amy. Mr. Miller has dedicated much of his life to serving the public, starting out as the mayor of his small hometown of Young Harris in north Georgia. This outstanding career led him through every level of service, including State senator, Lieutenant Governor, Governor, and United States Senator. Mr. Miller’s dedication to his home State of Georgia and the United States as a whole continues to have lasting effects that are felt to this day. As Governor of Georgia one of Mr. Miller’s greatest gifts was the HOPE Scholarship. This fund opens up educational 
opportunities for thousands of Georgians every year by providing college tuition assistance to qualified students. Mr. Miller’s legacy is well known in Georgia, but his accomplishments and charisma also earned him the respect of his colleagues across our Nation. Once again, I want to wish a happy 85th birthday to Zell Miller and thank him for his contributions to Georgia and the United States. We can all learn from the great example of his dedication to the public. b1930 
CONGRATULATING RUTGERS SCARLET KNIGHTS MEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Rutgers men’s basketball team on a tremendous accomplishment. With their win last night over The Ohio State University, the Scarlet Knights celebrated their first Big Ten Tournament victory since joining the conference in 2014. Their hard work this season has paid off, and they now advance to play Northwestern tonight. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the team, firstyear head coach Steve Pikiell, and the entire Rutgers program. Following their win, Coach Pikiell said that the team learned how to compete this year. Well, last night it certainly showed, and I look forward to watching the Scarlet Knights play tonight and wish them continued success in the tournament. 
PAKISTAN IS NOT ON OUR SIDE (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of TEXAS. Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise Pakistan is not the friend they portray themselves to be. They are a devious, deceptive, and disloyal ally. For years they have supported the Taliban by providing them cover, cash, and weapons. However, this Benedict Arnold ally is among the leading recipients of U.S. foreign assistance for the last 14 years. Mr. Speaker, we don’t need to pay Pakistan to betray us, they will do it for free. The Taliban’s headquarters is, you guessed it, in Pakistan. When a U.S. drone attack took out the Taliban’s leader in May 2016, he was in Pakistan. This should be the last rodeo for Pakistan. This is why I have introduced the Pakistan State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act. The bill requires the administration to issue a report containing either a determination that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism or a justification as to why it is not. It is time to determine whose side Pakistan is on. And, Mr. Speaker, they are not on our side. And that is just the way it is. f 
REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE PLAN FAILS AMERICANS (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, the Republican healthcare plan would not only fail to improve upon the Affordable Care Act, it would undo the benefits millions of Americans depend on and devastate our economy in the process. This plan would strip millions of working families of their health care, cut benefits for millions more, and increase premiums for older Americans by 25 percent. It would ravage our economy by destabilizing the healthcare sector and pushing State and local governments to the brink of bankruptcy. Four Republican Senators have even rejected this bill because of its economically devastating Medicaid cuts. The Republican plan would force the counties I represent to pay hundreds of millions of dollars more for health care. This bill would force local governments to raise property taxes or deny health care. We need healthcare solutions that improve care and strengthen our economy at the same time. We must not settle for this plan, which accomplishes neither. 
HARDSHIPS FACED UNDER AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with you one of the countless stories my office has received that highlight the hardships faced under the Affordable Care Act, primarily by middleincome families. This one came in on January 17. Joe writes: ‘‘Mr. LaMalfa, I was penalized $850 on my 2015 tax return for the transgression of not having been enrolled in the Affordable Care Act. ‘‘I simply cannot afford the now $895 permonth premium, double, to insure my family of three. I have been forced into what’s called selfpay for our doctor visits. ‘‘Cancer biopsies, ZPacks, dental, and eyeglasses all come out of my paycheck . . . it sure would have been nice to have that extra $850 penalty to pay for all this.’’ He ended his message stating, simply: ‘‘ObamaCare needs to be repealed and replaced with free market policies that can be purchased across State lines.’’ His testimony highlights one of the primary issues with the ACA: fewer choices, increasingly expensive premiums, deductibles that are out of sight that are forcing citizens into paying out of pocket for services they need. Another one of my constituents told me they were ultimately forced to choose between paying their mortgage and paying their monthly premium. That is not a choice at all, and one that should not have to be made. f 
REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE PLAN WILL HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACT (Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican healthcare plan and its devastating impact. When it comes to the Affordable Care Act, I have always said: mend it, don’t end it. I came to Congress wanting to work together on a bipartisan plan that would build and improve upon the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, the plan the Republicans have offered and that is supported by the President was written in secret, kept under wraps, and is now being rushed through marathon subcommittee sessions so the American people don’t have a chance to actually see what is in this bill. Republicans refuse to wait for the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group, to tell us how much their plan will cost and how many people will get thrown off their health care plans. Maybe that is because their plan offers tax breaks to the wealthy while the rest of us get stuck paying the bill. Reductions proposed in this bill would result in over $1 billion in cuts for New York State this year. Now the American Association of Retired Persons, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and a growing list of Republican and Democratic Governors throughout the Nation oppose this plan. So instead of pushing through a bill that we know will result in rising premiums and throw people off their healthcare, let’s come together and find a solution that makes sense for all Americans. 
OPPOSING REPEAL AND REPLACE (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the repeal and replace bill offered by my Republican colleagues. I have never believed ObamaCare was perfect, but it was a step in the right direction. We will only move our healthcare policy forward by working together to 
build on the very real successes of ACA and fix the actual problems with the law. But this legislation as proposed does none of that and, in fact, takes us in the opposite direction. Under the proposed legislation, 10 million Americans would lose their health insurance, according to an analysis from Standard and Poor’s. Seniors would be charged much more than what others pay for health care, and the 3.2 million Illinoisans who depend on Medicaid will face cuts to their coverage. Mr. Speaker, this House is recklessly and unnecessarily rushing to a vote before we have basic answers. Most importantly, we need to know from the Congressional Budget Office how many people this bill will and will not cover and how much it will cost. We need to set aside the politics and work in a bipartisan way to give all Americans quality, affordable health care. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the bill. 
HONORING CHRISTOPHER ‘‘NOTORIOUS B.I.G.’’ WALLACE (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, this is a very special day to many of us Caribbean Americans as we pay tribute to the life of Christopher Wallace, otherwise known as Biggie Smalls. 
Livin’ life without fear, Putting five karats in my baby girl’s ear, Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool, Considered a fool ’cause I dropped out of high school, Stereotypes of a black male, Misunderstood, And it’s still all good, And if you don’t know, now you know. f 
HONORING CHRISTOPHER ‘‘NOTORIOUS B.I.G.’’ WALLACE (Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Brooklyn’s own Notorious B.I.G., JamaicanAmerican Christopher Wallace. In celebration of his life and living legacy, I share these words: 
Thinkin’ back on my oneroom shack, Now my mom pimps an Ac with minks on her back. And she loves to show me off of course, Smiles every time my face is up in The Source. We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us, No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us. Birthdays was the worst days, Now we sip champagne when we thirsty, Uh, right, I like the life I live, ’Cause I went from negative to positive. And it’s all good. And if you don’t know, now you know. GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of an important bipartisansupported vital Environmental Protection Agency program, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, spanning the largest body of freshwater on the face of the Earth. Many media outlets have suggested that the President intends to cut this program by 90 percent—90 percent. I would like to clarify that this proposal is not yet official, but it is more than a rumor. So I would like to believe that this President who achieved the White House by carrying the Great Lake States of Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and my own Ohio, would not take this awful step backward. Candidate Trump traveled to Flint, Michigan, and promised that the water situation would never happen if he were President. Is he going to reverse his firm promise of clean water? The blue economy of the Great Lakes depends on clean water: a $7 billion maritime industry in Lake Erie alone; jobs related to the automotive and industrial sector of our country; recreational opportunities; and, most importantly, preserves clean drinking water for the millions and millions of people who depend on that today and in the future. Supporting the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is not partisan; it is common sense. 
HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BIGGS). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have this time on behalf of the minority and the Progressive Caucus. We have a number of very distinguished Representatives who want to talk about what is going on with people’s health care in America and the attacks leveled against it this week in Congress. Before we begin, I yield to my distinguished colleague from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Maryland for yielding. 
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine. SaltnPepa and Heavy D up in the limousine, Hangin’ pictures on my wall, Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl. 
Those were the words of the late great Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, Frank White, the King of New York. He died 20 years ago today in a tragedy that occurred in Los Angeles, but his words live on forever. I have got the privilege of representing the district where Biggie Smalls was raised. We know he went from negative to positive and emerged as one of the world’s most important hiphop stars. His ragstoriches life story is the classic embodiment of the American Dream. Biggie Smalls is gone, but he will never be forgotten. Rest in peace, Notorious B.I.G. Where Brooklyn at? b1945 Mr. RASKIN. Thank you very much to the distinguished gentleman from New York. We are going to go from the Notorious B.I.G.’s music to the notorious GOP healthcare proposal being considered in Congress this week. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials in the RECORD on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maryland? There was no objection. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield to my colleague from Minnesota, Mr. ELLISON . It was 7 years ago in March 2010 that President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law extending access to affordable health insurance coverage to more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans. Insurance companies under the new law could no longer deny you insurance because you had a preexisting condition, and, surely, that makes sense. The fact that you have a preexisting medical condition should be the reason that you get health insurance, not the reason you get denied health insurance. Also, under the new ACA, young people up to age 26 could stay on their family plans, which helps families like mine because I have got a 22yearold, a 20yearold, and a 25yearold. And believe me, they would not have health insurance if not for the Affordable Care Act, and I think my situation is that of millions of people across the country. But today, the ACA is in mortal danger. The House GOP finally unveiled their plan for repealing and replacing the ACA with something else, which I call the unaffordable care act, that will cost millions of people their health insurance, increase everybody’s premiums, reduce everybody’s coverage, and bring incoherence and chaos into the system. Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield to Mr. ELLISON in just a moment to talk about what is going on with this legislation. But I do want to say something about the process by which we arrived here, because back when the Affordable Care Act was being debated—and I 
wasn’t in Congress then, so I approach this just as a historian—there were multiple complaints from the GOP Members about how fast things were going, how the legislation was being rammed through. For example, our nowSpeaker PAUL RYANsaid about the ACA: ‘‘Congress is moving fast to rush through a healthcare overhaul that lacks a key ingredient,’’ he said, ‘‘the full participation of you, the American people.’’ GREGWALDEN , the Energy and Commerce chairman from Oregon, said: On a bill of this significance, you would think we would at least allow people to come in who are affected by the extraordinary changes in this bill, and have a chance to let us know how it affects them. And the Ways and Means Committee chairman today, KEVIN BRADY , said: The Democratic Congress and White House simply aren’t listening. The Democrats are ramming it through over the public’s objections. Well, let’s go back and look at how long it took the Democrats to get the Affordable Care Act passed and how much public participation and debate there really was. Here in Congress, there were 79 hearings—I repeat, 79 hearings—on the Affordable Care Act. There were 181 witnesses, both expert witnesses and members of the public, citizens coming to testify about the need for expanded health insurance coverage for the American people because of the high expenses of health insurance and the ripoffs of various insurance companies. There were multiple scores that were received from the Congressional Budget Office during that time, as there was constant attention to the budgetary and fiscal implications of the Affordable Care Act. Now, fastforward to today. We took a yearandahalf to get to the Affordable Care Act. How about them? Well, let’s see. The Republicans introduced their bill on Monday. They passed their bill in the dead of night, at 4:30 in the morning, 3 days later. There have been no hearings on the bill. There have been no witnesses to testify on the bill. There have been no expert witnesses. There have been no witnesses from the public. There is no analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on how much the bill will cost American taxpayers, American citizens, on their plans or how many Americans will lose their health care at all. In other words, the party that complained about how fast the Affordable Care Act came into being, which was over the course of a year and a half with dozens of hearings, and dozens and dozens—more than 100 witnesses and lots of public debate where we went back to our districts and had townhall meetings, where there was orchestrated opposition against the plan, but we still stood there and we engaged in the dialogue, and we stood up for the Affordable Care Act. The people who said that that was too fast are now ramming through, at unprecedented, breakneck, lightning speed, a bill that will wreak devastation on the healthcare rights of the American people. That is what is taking place. If you have got a contaminated, clandestine, secret, closed process, it will produce a terrible, undemocratic, and unhealthy result. That is what we are going to describe to you tonight. I am delighted to yield to my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON .) Mr. ELLISON. Congressman, thank you for that introduction, and thank you for your service to the Congress and the great people of Maryland. I think it is really important tonight to focus on a few key things about what is happening in Congress. One is that 20 million people stand to lose their healthcare coverage. Many have never had it, and the Republican majority is set to snatch it from their hands. That is really sad. One of the people who come to mind is actually a young woman who works on my staff. Her name is Abby, and she is a young woman who has her whole life to look forward to, but as a young person, when she was born, she had a disease called toxoplasmosis. She doesn’t mind me talking about it because what Abby would tell you if she were here is that it was tough growing up. She had a lot of medical attention growing up. She was a good student, and she really braved all of the medical care she needed with tremendous courage, and her family was there with her the whole time. But she had numerous surgeries growing up, and she also came close to death’s door on more than one occasion. One thing that she says—and says to anybody who is willing to listen—is that the Affordable Care Act helped save her life. Why? Because Abby has a preexisting condition, a pretty serious illness. And she had insurance companies that have lifetime limits and annual limits on coverage and care. Without the Affordable Care Act and with the provisions that preceded the Affordable Care Act in the insurance industry, she simply was uninsurable, therefore, not in a position to get the care she needed. By some miracle, she made it to adulthood with the status quo before the Affordable Care Act, but the Affordable Care Act made the difference between her being with us and not. I was talking to a physician who operates an institution in my district called the Hennepin County Medical Center, HCMC, who said: Look, if you were to stack up all of the diseases in our country that end in fatality, you would have to put up there car accidents, you would have to put up there heart disease, you would have to put up there pulmonary illnesses and cancers, of course. But, he said, if you stacked those illnesses up on a list, the most fatal in a given year, he said, the third one would be uninsured, people dying because they don’t have insurance. And our Republican majority is here to tell us they are okay with that. It is hard for me to believe, but it is true. Right in front of us, we know that this repeal will relieve wealthy individuals of paying taxes. If they are able to repeal the Affordable Care Act, people with a lot of money are going to have more of it, and people who needed health care will have less of it. People who need help dealing with the doughnut hole and need to be filled in with the moneys that come from the Affordable Care Act won’t have that anymore. Now they will go back to the status quo of Medicare part D, which is where they get help up to a certain amount, then there is no help, then they have got to spend up to start getting help again. The Affordable Care Act filled in the doughnut hole, and seniors who can barely afford their prescription drugs now will have even more trouble. Seniors who need Daraprim, which was a medication that cost about 13 bucks until this guy Shkreli bought the patent for it and jacked it up to about 700 bucks, people who need even things like insulin, people who need all kinds of medications now are going to be staring at that doughnut hole all over again. I mean, we can get up here and talk about the toll, the human tragedy, the pain and suffering that people are looking at, but none of it seems to penetrate the minds of our colleagues. They seem to be deaf to the pleas of people like Abby and so many other people like that. I was here when my colleagues on the other side brought forth I think as many as 60 attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We would come forth and we would say: People are getting lifesaving treatments that they never could afford before; people are getting treatments that are literally keeping their families intact, keeping their lives intact; people are getting coverage they never had; people have something more than the emergency room to turn to. Our colleagues would just say: Well, we are just going to get rid of it anyway. In fact, I remember, Mr. Speaker, when the Republicans shut down the government for 16 days because we refused to cooperate with their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. TED CRUZoccupied time and demanded that we repeal it. We said we would not turn people like Abby and others back to the tender mercies of the insurance industry. They said: Well, we will shut down the entire government unless you do it. We said no, and, well, here we are. It is true that we never thought we were going to lose this election. We never thought we would be this deep in the minority, but we now have gotten in a position where the Democrats 
don’t hold the Presidency. We have a President who ran on the promise of repealing the Affordable Care Act, and we have two Houses of Congress that are committed to doing it. The last line of defense really is the American people, Mr. Speaker. The last line of defense is the American people standing on the most fundamental of rights, the First Amendment, which guarantees them the right to redress grievances, guarantees them the right to petition their government, guarantees them the right to freedom of assembly, guarantees them the right to freedom of faith, guarantees them the right to receive information from a free press. We are relying on that amendment, Mr. Speaker, to stop these Republican efforts to snatch healthcare access out of the way, out of the hands of Americans. We are relying on Americans to stand up and say: We will not tolerate this—going to community meetings, going out on the street, using their rights as Americans to express their right to have health care. This is what the moment calls for. Governors, even some Republican Governors, are saying: Wait a minute. This Medicaid expansion, you know, we used it. It is not so bad. It is helping us. Their pleas are being ignored as well. We are at a critical moment: Will the American people continue to make the same advances that people all over the developed world have made with regard to health care? You know, Europeans look at us and think there is something wrong with us. Even our northern neighbors look at us and say: Wait a minute. Health care is not a right down there? No. You get it if you can pay; and if you can’t pay and answer somebody’s bottom line, you are just out. We pay the most for health care in the whole wide world, Mr. Speaker. We pay the most—the most—and yet we don’t have the best outcomes. We don’t have the best indicators of health. Yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to return us to a day when the number one reason that people would declare bankruptcy was medical debt. That is the world we are looking at, and it is really, really something. Now, many people have said—you know, Democrats say to me all the time, and I am sure they say it to Mr. RASKIN of Maryland: Hey, look, you know, there are things we would change in the Affordable Care Act. We are not saying that it fell down from tablets in the sky. Of course, there are reasonable amendments that might be made. But I am here to say to you, Mr. Speaker, that the Republican caucus has never said: We will talk about how we are going to make reasonable amendments to make it better. They have only said to repeal, repeal, repeal. They have also said replace, but everyone knows you cannot repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act because, if you repeal it, you are repealing all of the taxes that go along with paying for it. And if you repeal the taxes, you are going to tell me that a Republican caucus is going to levy a tax? They think tax is a fourletter word if somebody with a lot of money has to pay it. b2000 Now, they are okay with fees and pushing down regressive taxes. They do that every day and all the time. If somebody with real means has to pony up, even though they are already wealthy, you could never see a Republican do that. It is just not something they are going to do. The ACA has provided coverage to more than 20 million people. That is 20 million more people who have better patient care, access to doctors and medicines, and are no longer turned away because of preexisting conditions. The Republican proposal puts the brakes on the progress we have made. People will lose access to insurance coverage. The Republicans gut the preventative health fund, which literally funds programs to invest in keeping people healthy. Who do Republicans help? Insurance and pharmaceutical corporations. They get huge tax breaks at the expense of the help and the future of the American people. The Republican bill doesn’t stop there. It is an outright attack on Medicaid. Seniors out there should know that the Republicans are attacking Medicaid. They are attacking Medicaid. Medicaid is one of our most effective antipoverty programs and provides lifesaving care to millions of elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. Republicans want to dismantle the program as we know it and kick people off and leave States to pay for the bill. This bill takes away health care from women and shifts costs to the older, sicker people. It compromises the Medicare trust fund. It destroys Medicaid and gives tax breaks to corporations and millionaires. It is wrong, and the American people need to oppose it. And I oppose what they are trying to do. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I hope the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON) will stick around. I want to salute him and congratulate him on his new position, not only as a leading Member of the United States House of Representatives, but now as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. All of your colleagues are beaming with pride about your accomplishments and about your national political leadership, and we are delighted that the rest of the country is going to get to share in your leadership now in your new aggressive role out organizing opposition to what is taking place in Washington today. I want to take a little break from railing about this unaffordable care act that is going to drive everybody’s rates up and throw millions of people off their health insurance. I want to say a couple of good things that President Trump said as a candidate because he attacked ObamaCare, but he said he wanted a system that covered everybody. He’s been quoted many times speaking in favor of a singlepayer plan that would cover every citizen. Now, that talk has completely dried up. It has vanished and disappeared. I urge President Trump to go back to his original instinct, which is that, if you are going to repeal and replace ObamaCare—the Affordable Care Act, as he keeps saying—let’s replace it with the kind of system they have in Canada, they have in Europe, and just cover everybody. That would be the direction to go in. But to go backwards to throw millions of people off their health care is precisely what the American people don’t want. Now, here is another proposal that President Trump mentioned in passing when he stood in this Chamber the other night. He said: Let’s repeal the special interest lobbyist provision that was snuck into Medicare part D, saying that the government could not negotiate for lower drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies. Again, that was a very popular talking point for Donald Trump when he was running for President. He campaigned like Williams Jennings Bryan, but he is governing like William McKinley; that is, a cabinet filed with CEOs and billionaires. He did mention that. That was one tiny crumb, a remnant of the populist campaign he ran. I urge my Republican colleagues to throw this terrible bill that they are going to waste everybody’s time on, that cannot pass, which their Freedom Caucus is totally opposed to; and, instead, focus, at least, on something we can agree on, which is that the 25 or $30 billion that that special interest provision is costing us should be saved. We should allow the government to negotiate for lower drug prices in the Medicare program the way we are allowed to negotiate for lower drug prices in the Medicaid program and in the VA program. So we can work together in a bipartisan basis. However, we are not going to allow anybody to throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance plan while driving up everybody else’s rates and bringing the whole healthcare system to the brink of ruin. When I got elected to Congress, I went down to the basement of the Longworth House Office Building after I was sworn in to sign up for my health care because we get health care as part of our jobs as Members of Congress. We pay for it through the local ACA healthcare exchange in the District of Columbia, but we are guaranteed the right to get that because of the Affordable Care Act. When I went down that morning, I was signing up and I was looking 
through the memo about what we would be doing during my first week in Congress here. Sure enough, I saw that the GOP leadership had put on there a procedural proposal to set the stage for the dismantling of the Affordable Care Act. I looked up to see a line of my new colleagues waiting to come and sign up for their health care. Some of them I recognized as my Democratic colleagues, and some of them I recognized as my new distinguished Republican colleagues. And I said to myself: Wait a second. Please tell me that we are not going to have new Members of Congress come in here and sign up for their own health care that they get as part of their job as Representatives in the United States House of Representatives and then go upstairs to this floor to vote to strip millions of people of their health care. Surely that is not what democratic representation means in the 21st century; that we get to have health care through our jobs, but we are going to take away the health care that other people have. But, my friends, I am sorry to say that is the reality that we are in this week. Congressman ELLISON is right, we are not taking the position that the Affordable Care Act is perfect. Far from it. I wasn’t in Congress then. I don’t know if the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ) was. I wasn’t in Congress then. But had I been in Congress, I would have been fighting for a single payer plan. I am on legislation this session to support a singlepayer plan. In other words, the Affordable Care Act, for me, doesn’t go far enough in guaranteeing that everybody has health care and in dramatically reducing the role of the insurance companies so we can spend more money on health care and less money on red tape and bureaucracy. So the Affordable Care Act, which I support with all of my heart right now against all the attacks to dismantle it, was a compromise. It was a very carefully crafted compromise. Remember, we had more than 100 witnesses come and testify about it. They had zero on their crashandburn legislation this week. We had dozens and dozens of hearings where we had witnesses come and testify about it. They have had zero on their crashandcash legislation—crash the system and give cash to the insurance companies and the wealthiest people in the country. So we had an open process, and it was a compromise. I remember very clearly as a State senator in Maryland watching President Obama on TV saying, if we are starting from scratch, he would be in favor of a singlepayer plan. He said that would be the logical way to go. It is what they have in Europe. It is what they have in Canada and Mexico. He said we are path dependent. We are on a particular path. We understand the role that the big insurance companies play, and they have got a lot of political power, and we have got everybody on the GOP side screaming and shouting for the insurance companies. So he said let’s figure out a plan where we keep the insurance companies involved. Guess what? That plan was hatched at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, much beloved and revered by the GOP Members of this body. It was the exact same plan that Governor Mitt Romney, their standard bearer running for President a couple of elections ago, put into place in Massachusetts. The Affordable Care Act was the compromise. Now everybody is on their case because they are hiding under their desks, they are running away from their constituents, and they are canceling their townhalls. Nobody could get a plan out of them. Suddenly they pull a plan out of their sleeve in the middle of the night. They rush it through this body. They voted on it at, I think, 4:30 in the morning after a 27hour hearing. Everything is meant to be under the cloak of darkness, and people are making fun of them about how silly it is. I sympathize with them because there is nothing they can do because the Affordable Care Act was the compromise. Now, they wanted to name it ObamaCare, of course, because they couldn’t stand the idea that President Obama would get the political credit for bringing tens of millions of Americans health insurance. So they had to name it on him and then make up all of these stories about how terrible it was. Guess what? They wake up today. Nobody is calling it ObamaCare anymore. President Obama is doing his own thing. They are calling it the Affordable Care Act, and people are defending it all over the country in 50 States in every congressional district. You have got indivisible groups that have grown up all over the place, and my dear colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle are afraid to face their own constituents. They are canceling their townhalls, they are hiding under their beds and behind their office sofas, which, in many cases, are the exact same pieces of furniture because they sleep in their offices here. They don’t want to face the people and the fact that we do not want to turn the clock back and go backwards and wreck this system. It is a lot easier to destroy things than to build things. So we urge the GOP: If you want to meet to make real substantial improvements, expansion of the Affordable Care Act to include more people, to reduce the cost of the bureaucracy, let’s do it. But your plan is a terrible plan. Your plan is one that is going to throw millions of people off of their health insurance. Your plan is one that is built around a huge tax break and transfer of wealth upwards in the country—one of the biggest transfers of wealth in the country ever to go in the northward direction. It is an amazing thing that that is how they have designed their plan. So it is a huge tax break to the insurance companies and to the wealthiest people, and millions of others are thrown off of their insurance plans. Everybody else’s premiums are going to be soaring, and the whole system is likely to come crashing down. If a foreign government like Russia, for example, were trying to do this to us, we would consider it an act of aggression, an act of war against the American people in our health care. But this is, instead, coming from what used to be one of our great political parties, the party of that President who talked about government of the people, by the people, and for the people. We have, instead, a wrecking ball targeted right at you, the American people, coming after your health insurance, your health care, your ability to participate as a citizen in our healthcare system. That is a remarkable thing to be taking place in 2017. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the thoughtful gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ). Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) for being so clear on the issues in front of the American people. It is so important that we have these Special Order hours so that we can really help the American people understand what is at stake; and what is at stake literally is the health and security of our Nation. When we talk about security, usually people think about law enforcement and military. There is also the security that families can expect, the security of your health. In this situation, the Nation’s security of health and family security is absolutely on the chopping block. Let me give you an example of what I mean. In the district I represent in Minnesota—which I am so proud to represent the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Minnesota—we used to have an uninsured rate which we thought was low. It was 10.9 percent. If you remember, in the preAffordable Care Act days, 10.9 percent was pretty low. Well, now it is 6.6 percent. That means literally thousands of Minnesotans can now go and get regular doctor care rather than just show up at the ER. Part of the way that we used the Affordable Care Act in Minnesota in the Fifth Congressional District is that the folks at HCMC set up something called Hennepin Health. What Hennepin Health does is it says: We are going to take some of these Medicaid dollars and we are going to help people who are chronic users of the ER system. We are going to work with other agencies and other providers in the community to help house them stably and then do regular medical surveillance with them. Do you know what has happened with this program? The costs at the ER have dropped through the floor. The money has been 
saved because of the Affordable Care Act. Not only is it about the money— because if you talk to our Republican friends, all they want to talk about is money—something even more important has happened. b2015 When you talk to the people who would go to the ER all the time, they are saying: I have somewhere to live. I have somebody who helps me stay on my medication. I am beginning to rebuild relationships with my family again. Schizophrenia can be very devastating to your mental health; and I was all out of control when I was off my meds, and I used to end up in the ER within an inch of my life. But now, because of the Affordable Care Act, I can get the care that I need, I can be stably housed, I can be productive in my community, I can be a participating family member again. It has improved their lives. I don’t understand what the Republicans don’t understand. It is a good thing to have people to have an option other than the ER. I heard one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, well, in America, if you show up at a hospital, there is a Federal law that says they have got to take you. It is true that if you show up at an ER, somebody is going to have to let you in there. They may move you from one hospital to another, but, eventually, the law does say you will end up with somebody seeing you. Guess what the medical professionals say about it? It doesn’t work. It is the most expensive care. It is usually left to people who have allowed an illness to fester and to go on and to advance, which makes it more difficult to treat, more expensive to treat. It is the wrong way to run a healthcare system. Yet, people have a straight face and say things like, well, you know, you can go to the doctor if you need to. It is called the ER. This is absolutely not the right thing. And so here we are again, right at this hour where, really, things look kind of grave, and we need the American people to stand up and object. I tell you, we need people to say that they insist upon a humane society where a person suffering from schizophrenia, who is so afflicted by their illness that the only thing they can do is make it through the day and then, if they get sick, maybe somebody will take them to the ER. We should have a society where that person can get the care they need, can get housing that they need, can be cared for, and can be a participating member in our society with just a little bit more help. I think that is what makes us Democrats. That is the difference between us and them. We care about people. We believe people are inherently valuable and all have dignity, and we don’t believe that you are only as worthy as what is in your pocket or your bank account. We reject that idea out of hand and believe that people must be— if you are too poor to work, too sick to work, too old to work, we believe our society should care for you; and I don’t make any apologies to anybody for believing that. I believe the government should do everything it can to make sure there are enough goodpaying jobs for everybody. Lord knows we have got enough work to do around here, potholes here and there, school kids need help. We have got plenty of work to do. That is not the problem. We have also got plenty of wealth. We have got plenty of wealth in our society. And I believe that if you live in this greatest of all countries in the world—and I believe that, I am so proud to be an American—and you are allowed to make a profit, which I believe in that, I am a former businessperson myself—I don’t think it is asking you too much to put a little bit in the pot so some people who can’t afford it can go to the doctor. I don’t think it is asking you too much to put a little bit in a pot so a kid can go to school, or so that a senior can get medication, or so that we can have clean water. I don’t think it is too much. But some people think it is too much to say that, even though I have been blessed by being an American and being able to pursue my economic dream, I don’t want to give them anything. This is all for me. I just don’t—we are just not on the same page with that. We think that it is all right to make sure that we fund the basic necessities that people need to have a thriving, humane society, and that includes health care. So tonight, I just want to say to people that it reminds me of a question that a lady asked Benjamin Franklin when Benjamin Franklin walked out of the Constitutional Congress in Philadelphia, way back so many years ago. The lady said to Benjamin Franklin: What do we have, Mr. Franklin? He said: A democracy if we can keep it. Part of being a democratic society in this country right now means that we should have health care for people because this society can afford it. Part of what it means to have a civilized democracy in this moment means that people can rise up and lift their voices up to defend their right to have decent health care for all in this society; and we urge people to do that because it is the right thing to do, and this is the right time to do it. So I want to just yield back to my friend from Maryland. I will be taking my leave at this point, but I want to thank the gentleman for holding down this very important Special Order because the Affordable Care Act is worth fighting for. As you said, Mr. RASKIN , the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. What piece of legislation ever was? We have amended the 1964 Civil Rights Act. We have amended the 1965 Voting Rights Act. We amend laws all the time because, as society changes and times change, the needs come up. But to just repeal and then not come anywhere close to replacing, it is wrong, and we must oppose it. Mr. RASKIN. I thank the gentleman so much and, again, I salute him for his incredible work for the people of Minnesota and the people of America. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FASO). The gentleman from Maryland has 20 minutes remaining. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I just want to tie up some loose ends by exploring a few of the points that Mr. ELLISON raised. But one of the very messy features of this legislation that is barreling through Congress this week is that the GOP leadership understood how popular the ban on denial of coverage for preexisting conditions is. That is going to be a mainstay of American life. People should not be denied health care because they have a preexisting condition. That is the reason they should get health care, because they have a preexisting condition and they need it. So they don’t want to get rid of that. They understand that that is politically toxic. But they don’t want to have the mandate for individuals to have to purchase insurance under the Affordable Care Act. That has been the major problem they have with the ACA. That is their major anathema. They can’t stand that. But guess what? You can’t have one without the other. And if they believe in economics and they are being honest, they will have to concede that. Why? Well, if I am a healthy young person, as I used to be, I will say to myself: Wow, an insurance company has got to cover me, even if I have got a preexisting condition, and I am perfectly healthy now, and I don’t have to buy the insurance. So I am just going to go on my merry way, ladida, until maybe 1 day I have got a problem, I am in an accident, or I get some kind of diagnosis. At that point, I go to an insurance company, and they are going to cover me. So they have kept the preexisting condition provision of ObamaCare, which is wildly popular in the country now. They are terrified to touch it now, although they were opposed to it before. But their proposal gets rid of the individual mandate, and it doesn’t work. It will bankrupt the entire system. It is not going to work. Now, another thing is that they are ignoring the extraordinary success of the Affordable Care Act. With whatever flaws it has got, it has been extraordinarily successful. It has dramatically reduced the number of uninsured people. It has insured more than 20 million people who did not have insurance before, and, therefore, it has dramatically reduced the number of people 
showing up at the hospital in the emergency room with no insurance, and the hospitals have been obligated to see them. And who pays for that? Guess who pays for it? You do, I do, the American public does when people show up without insurance. But the Affordable Care Act reduced, in a very significant way, the number of people showing up like that. Now, in my home State of Maryland, we have seen extraordinary reductions in the numbers of people showing up in the emergency room without insurance because of the ACA. We have cut the uninsured rate by more than onethird in Maryland. We had a rate of 10.6 percent. Now it is down to 7 percent since the ACA was implemented. All of the people who run the hospitals and our healthcare system are terrified that, if the GOP bull in the china shop wrecks the Affordable Care Act, what is going to happen is we are going to have hundreds of thousands of more visits every year in emergency rooms by people who are not covered by insurance, which means that the taxpayers get stuck with the bill again. Now, let me tell you about my congressional district, the beautiful Eighth Congressional District, of which I am very proud. Everybody loves their district, but I do have the most beautiful, the most extraordinary district in the country. In Montgomery County, Maryland, in Frederick County, Maryland, and in Carroll County, it is gorgeous. Please come out and visit us in Bethesda, in Rockville, throughout Carroll County, throughout Frederick County. Come to Middletown, go to Thurmont, check it all out. It is beautiful. Come and visit us. Look what has happened in the Eighth Congressional District. Well, as I said, we have reduced the uninsured rate by a third. We have 444,600 people in the district who have health insurance that covers preventive services today, like cancer screenings and flu shots, without any copays, without any coinsurance or deductibles, and they now stand to lose this access if the majority succeeds in eliminating the ACA provisions requiring health insurers to cover preventive services without cost sharing. We have got more than a half a million people in my district with employersponsored health insurance who are at risk of losing important consumer protections like the prohibition on annual and lifetime limits, protection against unfair policy rescissions, and coverage of preexisting health conditions if the ACA is entirely or partially repealed. We have 21,400 people in the district who have purchased highquality marketplace coverage, who now stand to lose their coverage if the marketplaces are dismantled. We have 16,000 people in the district who got financial assistance to purchase marketplace coverage in 2016, who are now at risk of coverage becoming unaffordable, if they have their way and they eliminate the premium tax credits, and so and so forth. Everything is dismantling the protections you have, making your premiums go up, throwing millions of people out of health insurance, and transferring lots of wealth upwards through the tax breaks that they want to give to wealthy people and insurance companies. By the way, as I understand it, there is a provision that they want to repeal which capped the tax deductibility of insurance company executive salaries beyond a half a million dollars. They want to repeal that, so that would continue to be tax deductible. You could pay them millions of dollars, and they get the tax break because, of course, that is going to be their first priority, making the wealthiest executives in the health insurance companies whole. Who cares what happens to everybody else, whether they lose their insurance, their premiums go skyhigh? They know exactly where their bread is buttered. And that is just the icing on the cake. Mr. Speaker, I don’t think that their legislation can pass because the American people are too smart for it and will not stand for it. I don’t think it will pass. The President is already distancing himself from it. We all started calling it TrumpCare. The word went out that he didn’t want it called TrumpCare. We think he knows that it is not going to pass, or, if it does pass, it is going to be a debacle of historic significance and moment. None of them want it to be named after them. We have offered RyanCare, we have offered TrumpCare. None of them want to be associated with it. I don’t think it is going through. I understand that the Freedom Caucus, which thinks that there should just be a total free market, is going to vote against their plan, which they say is worse than ObamaCare, which they hated from the beginning. Although they are ideologically opposed to it, they know that ObamaCare is working, and they know that lots of people are being covered on it. And now they are going to be throwing millions of people off of ObamaCare, but they don’t get what they want, which is a total free market. Of course, a free market in health care doesn’t work because health care is not a social domain where the market operates. b2030 If you get sick or if you get injured, then you are just taken to the hospital. You don’t have a lot of time to shop around for the best hospital or the best doctor. You just need to go in, which is why the civilized countries of the world that can afford it have gotten to the point of a singlepayer plan. But they want to take us from the Affordable Care Act backwards. They want it to be a dogeatdog medical care system. The American people are not going to accept that. They don’t have a majority in Congress to do it, and it is the job of the minority in Congress which represents a majority of the people. Remember that the Democratic candidate for President received 1.9 million votes more than the Republican candidate for President. So it is the job of the minority which represents the majority of the American people, and it is the job of the people of the United States to say that we reject this sloppy, terrible plan that they are trying to rush through Congress. If they want to have discussions about actually improving things, we are very happy to do it. Otherwise, this cannot be accepted, and the American people need to pay very close attention to what is taking place in Congress this week. I yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. Speaker. 
OBAMACARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to spend time here with my colleagues. We just heard a diatribe from our colleagues. It is interesting to me to note how they say the American people don’t want us to change this, but I have to remind my colleagues that I think the American people spoke very loudly on November 8. We have run multiple times to repeal this bill. I heard one of my other colleagues say that we voted over 60 times, and we are going to vote one more time to get rid of the Affordable Care Act because the American people have delivered that message to us, and we have a President that says that we will do this. I think, as we go through this, we are going to have some interesting conversations. Considering all the bickering and posturing you see in the media by partisans on the left and the right, it is time for Members of this body to step back for a moment and take stock of where we are in the healthcare debate. I was not a Member of Congress when the Affordable Care Act was passed. I was a practicing large animal veterinarian in private practice plying my trade and not a political animal, if you will. However, I was concerned to see the way the law was passed. My colleagues on the other side were talking about how this was rammed through Congress and how it was passed in the shadows—or how we are doing that now. But I have to remind them that in 2009 it was passed in the dark of night— no Republican input, no debate, and no discussion. It was just passed and rammed down the American people’s throat. I want to go on here, and I want to yield to a couple of my colleagues before I do. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ) because he has to go tend to some other business. I would like to have his input on this. DOUGLAMALFA is my good friend and a great leader up here. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California (Mr. YOHO), a good friend here, and my other colleagues here, to allow me the moment to speak. Mr. Speaker, I am really excited about the opportunity with this new administration for relief for regular Americans from the Affordable Care Act. I think the intentions may have been good when it was passed, but we see the devastating effects from the many emails, letters, calls, and the communications my office received from middleincome families. They are the ones that are the most negatively affected by this act. We have seen their premiums and their deductibles go out of sight. They may not even need to have the insurance anymore because the deductibles are so out of reach for them on cost, so insurance means nothing to them. Indeed, with most Americans having health insurance before the ACA that they were at least reasonably happy with, they have had that choice taken away from them. They have had choices taken away. My wife and I were sitting there in December 2013, being forced, just like everybody else, to enroll in a plan with a broken website trying to get it to go through. We knew at the time we were going to have big problems with that. We even agreed with the Republican conference when we were on the eve of this taking effect. The President decided that maybe we need to have a 1 year pause for this for employers of 100 people or more. We agreed with that. We offered legislation because you are not supposed to just do that with the stroke of a pen. Indeed, it was duly passed legislation with all Democrat votes, no Republican votes, just a few short years before. We agreed, let’s lay this for a year, if nothing else, for those larger employers. But we also said: Mr. President, we should also delay it for everybody else because we know it isn’t going to work. We know this is going to do nothing to curb costs. That really is the bottom line. It is the middleincome families that I am really worried about in this thing because, again, we received so many communications from them saying: Please help us. We can’t afford it. We are putting off being able to buy a home because we are seeing these costs go up. We are putting off college savings for our kids because our costs are spiraling out of control. So if we do nothing else in the process, again, are we going to come up with the perfect bill? There is no perfect bill when you have this many years of the type of government takeover of health care that we have seen here. But we are going to do the best we can because it is those folks out there—middleincome Americans—that we are trying to help to bring relief from the ACA so they can go back to doing the priorities they see: having affordable insurance, doctors they can choose, a plan they can choose, and being able to go off and do the things like saving for their kids’ college and maybe buying that home that is part of the American Dream instead of the American nightmare they see it has been. So I appreciate my colleague, again, having this time this night and for allowing me to speak for a few minutes. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California. Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, I was concerned to see the way the law was passed. It was passed in the middle of the night. I thought it was passed through hastily and without transparency. I did not think that boded well for the law’s success. Unfortunately, I was proven right. If you remember the words of the thenSpeaker of the House, it was passed without reading it, and the words were: We have to pass it to see what is in it. We have to pass it to see how it is going to work. Talk about legislative malpractice that was poured on to the American people to get a bill they didn’t want, that nobody read. Yet my colleagues on the other side are talking about how we are running this through without anybody’s input. It has had 6 years of input, it is coming together now, and our goal is to fix health care for the American people. As someone who has practiced medicine, I believe that, despite all the good intentions behind the Affordable Care Act, it was doomed to fail, as most Big Government programs are. In fact, one of the main reasons I ran was on behalf of patientcentered, freemarket oriented health care. I supported and still support healthcare reform that allows us in Congress to keep our promises when we talk about what we want to achieve. I was one of the Members that came up here who lost my health care because of the Affordable Care Act. My premiums have gone up over $11,000 since I have been here. My deductibles have gone up and my coverage has gone down. It is a disaster. I have to remind my colleague from Minnesota who was talking about how bad the Republican bill is that his own Governor from the State of Minnesota said that this bill is a disaster, the Affordable Care Act in its present form, and his premiums have gone up 45 percent in his own State. I want to remind this body that many people lost health care they had before ObamaCare was passed with the promise that if you like your plan, you can keep it. It was broken by our own President of the United States. If you like your plan, if you like your doctor, and if you like your insurance company, your premiums will go down $2,500 on an average. Lie after lie after lie. The American people answered that by electing a majority in Congress to the Republican Party to fix that, and that is what we aim to do. Supporters of the ACA also told us that the premiums wouldn’t increase. It turned out that was false. Premiums in the individual markets have increased partly because ObamaCare has forced insurers to leave the exchange. For example, benchmark silverlevel plan premiums have increased by an average of 25 percent from 2016 to 2017, according to the Department of Health. If you like the State of Arizona, the premium this year is going up an astounding 116 percent. They worry about us, and then they blame us for raising the cost of health care. Sophistry, pure sophistry. Many families have been forced to pay drastically higher outofpocket costs, which hits their pocketbooks hard even though they are not wealthy people by any stretch of the imagination. As my friend, Mr. LAMALFA , was talking about the cost, at the end of the month people are finding out they are running out of money before they run out of the month. I am reminded of one family in my district whom I met with personally many times over my tenure in Congress. They had to deal with the intense treatments and frequent hospitalizations for an illness that has hit two generations of their family very hard. They had coverage through an employer that they started out with, and it was a $350amonth premium right before the ACA passed in 2010. However, around the time the ACA mandates kicked in, their plan went up over $100 a month. Today their premium is a staggering $680 a month. That is over $8,000 a year in premiums, nearly double what they were paying before the ACA. These are the people that sent us up here to fix health care. Unless you are making six figures a year, this is an absolutely painful sum. Mr. Speaker, I may not generally be a supporter of government benefits, but I do believe very strongly that our government should make every effort in protecting our Nation’s vulnerable population, especially the chronically ill. My concern is the ACA has resulted in those groups being harmed more than anybody else. Particularly for those who had employerprovided insurance prior to the ACA, the law’s effect has been hurtful, especially if their coverage was for families afflicted by long term illness. Simply put, no healthcare law should ever make things worse for people who were responsible and had health care to treat a medical condition. If anything, that is the opposite of health care. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN), who is a good friend of mine. Dr. BABIN has practiced dentistry in our military and in the private sector. Right after graduating dental school, he was commissioned in the Air Force as an officer and was stationed overseas. I thank the gentleman 
for his service. He later returned to his native east Texas to open his own dental practice, which he operated for over three decades. He has served on the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners and as a member of the American Dental Association. Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding a Special Order on a topic that could not be more relevant than at this very time: the failures of ObamaCare. As a healthcare professional myself, the elected representative of over 700,000 constituents, and the grandfather of 13, I have a duty to see that access to medical care is more affordable for the welfare of my patients, for my constituents, and for the livelihood of my children and my grandchildren. ObamaCare moved us away from the patientcentered affordable medical care—the traditional doctorpatient relationship—that we have enjoyed for well over a century. ObamaCare was designed by Washington bureaucrats who, unlike other Americans, are exempt from ObamaCare. In the last 24 hours, I have heard from nearly 1,000 of my constituents who are overwhelmingly begging me to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a bill that restores their healthcare freedom. That is no surprise to me. I have heard from thousands of my constituents, including my own patients and my own family members, about how their premiums have skyrocketed and their deductibles have skyrocketed. They have health insurance, but they can’t afford to access medical care because their deductibles are too high and their longtime family doctors are no longer accepted as providers in their new health insurance. They have to drive long distances to get to a new and different doctor in their medical plan. They have had medical care interrupted. Simply put, they want this ObamaCare nightmare to end. A truck driver from Hardin County told me how she was forced to switch plans last year from the PPO that she wanted to keep to an HMO that she did not want. This has made it significantly more difficult for her to find a doctor to accept her insurance when she gets sick out on the road even though she pays much higher in premiums than she did last year for her PPO. Melissa, who lives in Harris County, has the same story. Last January she had to switch her family to an HMO plan because of ObamaCare’s limited choices in her community. This forced her family to leave their doctor of 20 years and their local pharmacy. Melissa said: I have always been a very responsible American citizen, yet ObamaCare told me what kind of plan that I had to buy. b2045 This is what ObamaCare does. It makes decisions for patients instead of the other way around. Brute Federal force. The message is clear: ObamaCare’s top down, Big Government approach is leading to higher premiums, less choice, and insufficient access for people in my district and all across this great land of ours. These higher outof pocket costs and premiums have priced too many Americans out of the insurance market altogether. Melinda, who lives in the county next to me, had an ObamaCare plan last year and paid nearly $600 a month. She also had a $3,000 deductible. She had to spend over $10,000 before her health insurance plan paid for anything. Even with these high premiums, her insurance plan would not cover many of her asthma medicines or the cataract surgery that she desperately needs. This year, when her premiums went up another $100, she dropped coverage altogether. Under ObamaCare, now she has lost affordable coverage, and she must pay a penalty, a tax. Angela, from Harris County, actually decided to sign up for an ObamaCare plan after going uninsured for some time. Unfortunately, she soon realized that the cost vastly outweighed the benefits. So this year, she chose again to go without insurance. Now she pays the ObamaCare tax. Others in my district don’t want insurance coverage or only want catastrophic coverage. Yet, they are forced to pay expensive fines. Their freedom of choice is grossly limited. Gina, a hardworking single mother and businessowner told me that she is now forced to use the little bit of money that she gets from her tax refund to pay the ObamaCare tax. Charlie from Harris County says that he wants me to vote to repeal the individual mandate, stating that ObamaCare has forced him to buy a product that he doesn’t want. ObamaCare relies on force and coercion, but this is not the American way. If ObamaCare is so good, why did a larger percentage of Americans elect to pay the penalty than to take the subsidy for their coverage last year? The American people deserve much better. I have got hundreds of similar stories, including those from a college student who couldn’t work more than 27 hours a week over her Christmas break to earn money for school because the ObamaCare law imposed costly mandates for her employer if she does. ObamaCare is in a death spiral and is imposing too much pain and suffering on the American people. Premiums have gone up, on average, by 25 percent across the country for enrollees this year alone. Some States, like Arizona, had a 116 percent increase in premiums. Twentyfive percent of Americans have only one health insurer to choose from, and 50 percent of Americans live in areas with only two insurance providers. Folks, that is not a choice. The complaints I am hearing now are at a fever pitch, and the American people are demanding a change now. We need a patientcentered healthcare system driven not by mandates and coercion, but by freedom and choice for my patients, for my constituents, for my family, and for all Americans. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Dr. Babin’s comments. He is very astute. He has been around health care. You know how this thing is not working and the strain it has put on people in your district, as it has in mine, and people around the country. I am relieved that Congress is moving forward on legislation to right these wrongs. It feels so good to be a Member of Congress today to live up to a campaign promise that everyone in the majority in the House, Senate, and executive branch says: We are going to fix this; trust us. I have the complete confidence in that. I look forward to engaging with my colleagues. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ). He is a farmer, smallbusiness man, and good conservative who understands the importance of keeping government out of our healthcare system. Our country’s farmers have been hit hard, just as much as others, by ObamaCare. Congressman NEWHOUSE  is, no doubt, well aware of these issues. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his leadership on this issue this evening and throughout this year. I also want to thank him for the opportunity to address the House of Representatives on this very important issue that we are dealing with right now. Mr. Speaker, throughout my time representing the good people of central Washington State in the U.S. Congress, constituents from across my district, the Fourth District, have shared with me their deeply personal stories. These are personal stories about the struggles and the hardships that they have experienced and that they have faced since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. So let me just relate to you a couple of those because I think they are very important and help illustrate exactly what it is that we are trying to correct. In late 2016, a gentleman from the city of Yakima wrote to me in distress, as his insurance provider was pulling out of Yakima County. He told me: My wife and I are losing our healthcare coverage. Our financial lives are about to be radically changed and a literal risk to our health is upon us. The challenge to find affordable, acceptable healthcare insurance will be immense. That is not unlike another story that I heard in early 2015. A young woman from Grandview wrote to describe her dire situation being forced on to the Affordable Care Act exchange. She told me: I was paying $231 a month for a policy that had a $500 deductible with a $10 copay. However, under the ACA, she said her healthcare costs have skyrocketed. She continues: I now pay $475 a month for a policy that has a $5,500 deductible. This is not affordable health care. It is the middle class American who has worked hard to have a good retirement who is being hit hard by this. 
Another gentleman from West Richland recently pleaded that the many middle class workers like him must not be forgotten as we repeal and replace this broken law. He says: Do not forget us when fixing. We liked our plan, and we lost it. Just last week, a farmer from Moses Lake called my office and said that, before the ACA, he was paying less than $200 a month for a catastrophic plan that provided coverage for his family. Now he is forced to pay $1,000 a month with high deductibles that discourage his family from even being able to use and access the healthcare insurance that they are paying for. These are just some of the many stories of the dozens, the hundreds that I have been hearing from over the last couple of years since I started representing the good people of central Washington. Like I said, these are true stories, personal stories of the struggles that people are facing on a daily basis and have pleaded with us to take strong action to deliver them from this situation that they find themselves in. I think it is similar across the country. As you hear tonight from other Members speaking about their districts, you are hearing similar stories. So that is something that, I think, as we debate the best way to repeal and to replace the Affordable Care Act, I am committed to ensuring that we protect the most vulnerable. I am also committed to providing relief for the majority of everyday, middle class Americans who have been devastated by this misguided and broken law. Let me just say: I hear you, I will not forget about you, and I will keep your stories at the forefront of my mind as we work to fix this failed system. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Washington State. I appreciate his words, his thoughtfulness, and the stories. You learn more from a story than you do facts and figures. I want to go over a couple of things here. As we have heard, the average increase of health plans in the United States rose by over 35 percent. I already talked about Arizona: 116 percent this year alone. The insurance exchanges that were set up—the 26 in the beginning—are down to 5, with some counties not even having exchanges to purchase insurance. I think for the people that are watching this at home, whether they are Members of Congress, the American citizens, I want you to listen to this, and I want to take you back to the information that came out when the Speaker of the House then talked about, we have to pass it to see what is in it, how it is going to work. Then I want you to picture the words of the architect of this bill, Jonathan Gruber: The lack of transparency and the stupidity of the American voter helped ObamaCare pass. The Democrats want to blame this body, the Republicans, for wrecking health care. This is what they passed on us and the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), who is the only pharmacist serving in Congress. As a healthcare professional, he knows these issues very well. He is the cochair of the Community Pharmacy Caucus and sits on one of the main healthcare committees in Congress, the Committee on Energy and Commerce. He ran his own business, like me, and witnessed firsthand the problems that government regulations and red tape cause on job creators, large and small. I want to remind folks, too, that there were over 22,000 pages of rules and regulations that came out of the Affordable Care Act. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the gentleman from Florida, Representative YOHO, for this opportunity and for hosting this tonight to discuss how ObamaCare is affecting folks at home. Consider the case of Bob Joiner, an independent adviser in south Georgia. His wife, Kim, is an audiologist who works in a small practice that does not provide healthcare benefits. Bob and Kim exercise regularly, they watch their nutrition, and they are fortunate to not have any health problems. They also have a 28yearold son named Wesley. In 2016, Bob’s monthly healthcare premium increased 134 percent, and his son’s climbed to an astonishing 190 percent. In total, their 2016 annual premiums were $4,285.56 for their son Wesley and $19,026.12 for Bob and Kim. The Joiners should have been hopeful that, in 2017, they could change their plan for something more affordable. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, that wasn’t the case. This year, only one Affordable Care Actcompliant plan was accessible to them on the healthcare.gov website. An additional policy featuring a higher deduction with lower premiums was available. However, the plan was not ObamaCare compliant, leaving the Joiners subjected to the Affordable Care Act penalty. Before ObamaCare, the Joiner family’s annual premium for the whole family—the entire family—was $7,428. At the time, they had access to multiple providers and dozens of plan designs. Unfortunately, ObamaCare has brought chaos into the healthcare system. I want to repeat that again. Before ObamaCare, the family’s annual premium for the whole family—for Bob, Kim, and their son Wesley—was $7,428. Last year, just for Wesley, it was $4,285. For Bob and Kim, it was $19,026. Folks, that is just astonishing. That is not right. The Joiners are not alone when they explained that they are unable to save for retirement or pay down their mortgage because of progressive increases in healthcare costs. Patients across the country now face this grim reality because ObamaCare has failed. Just as the Joiners saw patient costs are skyrocketing, last year the Obama administration even admitted that premium hikes were coming for this year’s healthcare plans. It turns out the national average premium increase is an astonishing 25 percent. That is the average. In seven States, it is more than 50 percent. Unbelievable. Well, Mr. Speaker, today is a new day. This afternoon, the Energy and Commerce Committee completed a marathon markup of its portion of what was ultimately to be the ObamaCare reconciliation bill. b2100 It was an honor to be a part of that. Twentyseven hours and 27 minutes we met, and we finally got it out of committee. Now it goes to the Committee on the Budget, along with the bill that the Committee on Ways and Means has sent. So those two bills will be put together and they will go to reconciliation. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have been a part of this historic opportunity, taking the first meaningful steps toward entitlement reform and replacing ObamaCare. I thank all of my colleagues who are here this evening taking part in this Special Order as well as thank each Member of Congress who has and continues to take a stand against the idea of a topdown, one sizefitsall approach to health care. Our plan presents a better way. The American Health Care Plan will give us access and affordability. It will give us patientcentered health care. Enough of this topdown, cookiecutter approach that we have had, thinking that everything from Washington, D.C., is better, thinking that we know what the States need. That is not right. What we need is to empower patients. What we need is to have patients in control of their healthcare system, and this is what the American Health Care plan does. It empowers patients through health savings accounts, through tax credits, reforming Medicaid. The American Health Care Plan is on its way. I am excited. I am excited for America. I, again, thank Representative YOHO for hosting this Special Order. We appreciate your work. I thank all Members of Congress who have had a part of this on both sides of the aisle. I thank everyone. Help is on the way: better health care, marketbased health care, where competition and choices will be the case, where insurance companies will be fighting for your business, where you will have choices, where you will have competition in the market. That is what we need. That is what is going to bring healthcare costs down. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. CARTER . I appreciate his being here. The effort he has put in, working diligently to help us right this wrong that 
has been instilled upon the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), a great colleague of mine who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research of the Committee on Agriculture; a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure; and the Committee on House Administration. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. YOHOfor leading this Special Order tonight to talk about this issue. It is an issue important to the entire country and all hardworking taxpayers of America. 1.4 million people were kicked off their plans and forced to purchase different insurance plans. We saw 45 to 55 percent premium increases in my home State of Illinois in 2017. Deductibles have increased 64 percent nationwide. 31 million people can’t afford to use the insurance they have because their deductibles are so unaffordable and high. Onethird of the Nation only has the option of one insurance provider on the $2 billion websites that we know as the ObamaCare exchanges, a monopoly that drives up costs, and 75 percent of people in my home State of Illinois have one or, at most, two providers. One in four people in Illinois are on Medicaid. That is unsustainable for a State with an $8 billion budget deficit. These statistics tell us ObamaCare is collapsing, and if we do nothing, we will be leaving millions of Americans without any option for healthcare coverage. But we are not offering this alternative because of statistics. We are doing it for Rich and Sandy in Pana, Illinois, whose deductibles went from $300 to $2,000 per person for less coverage. We are doing it for Janet from Edwardsville, whose family plan was considered a Cadillac plan and was replaced with a plan that had a $6,000 deductible. We are doing it for Lynne, a farmer in Springfield, Illinois, who provides insurance for her barn manager, but the best she could find after ObamaCare was one with a premium that increased by more than $100 and increased her outofpocket expenses by another $1,000. This is our one shot to fix our failing healthcare system for the constituents I just mentioned and the millions more across the U.S. who have had the same thing happen to them. This is a pretty good bill to start with. After 4 years of watching premiums more than double, deductibles skyrocket, and choices dwindle for my constituents under ObamaCare, I am proud to be part of a responsible healthcare solution to lower costs and increase options for individuals and families. The American Health Care Act may not be the exact bill we would have written to reform our healthcare delivery system prior to ObamaCare, but we can’t go back in time. We have to face reality, and the reality is we have States like Illinois who chose to expand Medicaid, and we can’t abruptly rip coverage away from them like ObamaCare did for 1.4 million Americans. In addition to protecting people with preexisting conditions and allowing young adults under the age of 26 to remain on their parents’ insurance, those who currently qualify for Medicaid will remain covered until their economic situation improves. Our goal should be to ensure that every single person who wants a career, a goodpaying job, and wants to get off of Medicaid should be our priority. But when their situation does improve, which is, again, what all of us should hope for, then we help them with monthly, portable, age and income based tax credits that will go directly toward paying their health insurance. These also help those who were left behind by ObamaCare, middle class Americans who were forced to buy insurance with costly premiums and deductibles but did not qualify for subsidies. This is just the first part of our plan, which can be done through the budget reconciliation process. Next is making changes to lower the overall cost of health care so these tax credits go further for every American. We have one chance to fix this for the American people because ObamaCare is collapsing, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this plan. I thank again my colleague, Mr. YOHO, for leading this effort tonight. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY  DAVIS). He brought up a very astute point. This is collapsing on itself. If we were to do nothing, this would collapse, and the American people would be left without any coverage. We have heard other people on the other side say: Leave it alone. That is irresponsible, and we will not do that. We will repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and we remove it from Washington bureaucrats and government mandates. If government can tell you what kind of insurance to buy, you have to buy it, and if you don’t, they penalize you, what else can they force you to do? Our Constitution is not a function of the government. Government is a function of the Constitution. Yet when government steps beyond the boundaries of the Constitution, it is up to us, we, the people—and we are the representatives of we, the people—to change how government works. That is what we are doing with the repeal and the replacement of the Affordable Care Act. We have heard about the nightmare this has caused to the American people, to our economy, the loss of jobs, the depression of job growth, wage growth. We can go on and on for hours, but it is not going to fix this problem. What I want to focus on for the next few minutes is what the replacement does do. We have heard about the mandates that are going away, the taxes that are going away, the expansion of Medicaid. The reality in America, our country is in financial dire straits. It is unsustainable. It would be imprudent for us to sit by and do nothing while the country goes into default. So with the direction we are going, this will bend the cost curve to Medicaid to make it solvent for a longer period of time. This will empower the individual to have health care and make those decisions between the doctor and the patient, the way it should be, instead of a governmentcontrolled mandate. This empowers individuals to be more responsible for themselves, to incentivize them to go out and buy health care by the use of health savings accounts, where they can buy overthecounter medications to share with family members the benefit of the health savings account. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all want preexisting conditions covered, so that is something we all are in agreement with. There is the argument about should children be able to stay on their parents’ policies until the age of 26. Personally, I don’t think they should have to—I think they should be out on their own, but I have heard from enough people in my district that I am willing to compromise and go along with that. Truth be known, children could already stay on their parents’ health plan until the age of 26 if they were actively enrolled in college or disabled. So we are compromising. This will make health care better. It puts health care into the hands of the American people and their doctors and drives government out of it. Let them oversee the process. We have heard over and over again that we need to open up the market across State lines. There is legislation coming out that will free up the insurance companies. We are introducing legislation to hold harmless insurance companies now, before we get through with this process, so that insurance companies are not held to the standards of the Affordable Care Act, so that they can start writing policies today when this legislation passes, so they can write their policies and start marketing now so that the American people will have time to research these products. There will be a transition period. I can’t guarantee it is going to be smooth. I can guarantee you it will be smoother than the last one. I think the last thing I want to leave the American people with is we don’t want to pull the rug out from anybody. We will do everything possible, and I know on both sides of this. I would think the Democrats, with the debacle that they created, the legislative malpractice that they passed in the dark hours of the night in December of 2009 or 2010, that they would want to come to the aid to fix health care for the American people instead of chastising us and telling us how bad and how wrong we are to interfere. 
This plan is going to collapse on its own. We invite them to come to the table to help us fix this because this is for all Americans, not just Republicans. It is for all Americans—Republicans, Democrats, Independents, everybody. I would hope they would come and help us do this. I think the last thing, Mr. Speaker, is this is a historic opportunity. The Wall Street Journal said never before has there been a chance to change a program as significant as what we are getting ready to do. We are the ones who are going to lead this effort to bring healthcare stability to the American people. I look forward to the discussions in the future. I ask the American people to believe in the people you sent up here to fix this. We are going to get it right. One last thing. I will guarantee you that this bill will be read before it is passed, and we will know how it is going to work. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
