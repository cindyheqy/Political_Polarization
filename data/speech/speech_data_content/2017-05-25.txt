1⁄2 years I have worked for the best people in America, the people of Texas 22. The people of Texas 22 love their neighbors. They love their community, they love life, and they love God. Texas 22 is Katie Vacek. Katie is a senior at Needville High School. Three months before using her Blue Jay wings to fly into her future, God gave her a different flight. She fell out of a tree with her boyfriend, Kernie, watching. She is now paralyzed from the waist down. Kernie, her classmates, and the whole town rallied around Katie and her dreams. Twelve days ago, at her prom with Kernie, she danced. Katie, I don’t want to come between you and Kernie, but I want you to be my date the next time President Trump speaks in this Chamber in February of next year. We will lock this down at the Knights of Columbus on June 6 back home. Keep fighting, knowing that God is with you always. 
BUDGET CUTS TO EDUCATION (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the budget released by President Trump. It is cruel and shortsighted in the extreme: cutting essential investments driving job creation, protecting our environment, funding breakthrough cures, and providing a safety net for the neediest among us. Among the most objectionable are the President’s cuts to education. Funds used for college workstudy programs, loan forgiveness for those who enter public service, and dollars used by schools for mental health will not just be cut but be eliminated. For example, 21st century community learning centers, which offer learning opportunities during nonschool hours for those from our neediest communities, would be completely eliminated. We know these programs work. An evaluation showed program participation improved math and English grades by 30 to 40 percent. In my district, Waukegan Community School District Number 60 uses these funds to offer an extended day program at seven schools to increase academic achievement and build life skills. Mr. Speaker, this budget irresponsibly mortgages our future by shortchanging our children. I urge my colleagues to reject this budget. Let’s work together to chart a path that ensures our Nation’s prosperity. f 
NATIONAL EMS WEEK (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week we observe National EMS Week to celebrate, unify, and inspire the men and women of our Nation’s emergency medical services. The theme this year is Always in Service, which recognizes our EMS professionals and their constant service to communities throughout this nation. From a young age, children are taught that, in a moment of crisis, they call 911. From illness to injury, whenever the world seems to be ending, society counts on EMS personnel to be 
there. They are expected to work hard and be strong, especially in times of trouble. Mr. Speaker, as a volunteer firefighter, EMT, and a rescue technician with more than three decades of experience being on the front lines with these EMS professionals, I can personally attest to their dedication to saving lives. The job of an EMS professional is not easy. It requires just as much compassion as it does courage. These men and women are committed to making the world better, so I say thank you. Thank you to the EMTs, paramedics, dispatchers, and supervisors across the country. Thank you for serving. Happy National EMS Week. 
CBO SCORE OF TRUMPCARE PAINTS A DIRE PICTURE (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, the new American Health Care Act CBO score released yesterday reinforces that this bill is devastating to the American people: 14 million more will be uninsured within just one year, and 23 million more will be uninsured over a decade. This analysis paints a dire picture. It confirms that TrumpCare will shift the burden of costs onto our seniors, millions of hardworking families, and patients with preexisting conditions. Those hit hardest are exactly the people who need care the most, all while giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires. What is more, this analysis debunks the gimmicks Republican leaders tried to sell us, saying the bill would do no harm to those with preexisting illnesses. In fact, patients with preexisting conditions will have less coverage, be forced to pay more, and even be priced out of the market, just as we expected. This is far too great a toll on the American people, and we must do better. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF SYRACUSE POLICE CAPTAIN RICHARD WALSH (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a dear friend and former colleague, longtime Syracuse Police Captain Richard Walsh. For nearly 20 years, I served as a Federal prosecutor in central New York. During much of this time, I had the distinct privilege of working alongside Captain Walsh and witnessed firsthand his commitment to serving the city of Syracuse. Captain Walsh joined the Syracuse Police Department in 1970, rising to the rank of captain of detectives. He led a very successful and distinguished career, retiring in 2011 after 41 years on the job. On the day of his retirement, Captain Walsh was named the grand marshal of the Syracuse St. Patrick’s Day parade, a mark of high distinction for any central New Yorker. In addition to his diligent efforts to keep our community safe, Captain Walsh volunteered countless hours to many community organizations, including Hunger Project, Huntington Family Center, and the Rape Crisis Center. Eternally proud of his Irish heritage and roots in Tipperary Hill, he devoted many hours to the Syracuse Irish Festival, was a founding member of the St. Patrick’s Day parade committee, and served as president of the Onondaga County Ancient Order of Hibernians. Captain Richard Walsh was the true definition of a public servant. He loved his work, he had the utmost respect of his colleagues and community, and he was relentless in his efforts to make central New York a safer and a better place. His kindness and generosity will forever be remembered. May Captain Richard Walsh’s name and legacy forever be remembered in the CONGRES SIONAL RECORD . Rest peacefully, my friend. 
GLOBAL WEEK OF ACTION ON HUNGER AND FAMINE (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a call of action to make sure that the country recognizes that we have got to focus on and talk about the more than 20 million people at risk of famine in South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and northeast Nigeria. This is a humanitarian crisis. Starving children and families are crying out for our help. Right now, 1.4 million children are acutely malnourished and at risk of death. Worldwide, an additional 50 million people are severely hungry, surviving day to day on only what they can find. The United Nations is calling this the largest humanitarian crisis that has faced the world since the organization was founded in 1945. Mr. Speaker, we can end this crisis if we just find the political will. That is why I am joining my colleagues in Congress and humanitarian and faith leaders around the country to mark a Global Week of Action on Hunger and Famine. Earlier this month, we were successful in securing an additional $990 million for famine relief in the fiscal year 2017 spending bill, thanks to a bipartisan coalition of Members and our passionate grassroots organizations. But this is not enough. The United Nations needs $4.4 billion by July to avert catastrophe. We need other countries to step up to the plate, and we must absolutely preserve our commitment to addressing famine. We cannot allow the Trump administration’s proposed budget, which would decimate food aid, to be enacted. MEANINGFUL REFORMS FOR THE VA (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to note the veterans’ bills passed by the House of Representatives this week. Amongst the legislation are bills to provide veterans with a costofliving adjustment for disability compensation, create a pilot program to explore magnetic resonant therapy as treatment for veterans with mental health conditions, and streamline the disability claims process at the VA, amongst other legislation. I would like to specifically highlight the VA Scheduling Accountability Act. A 2014 investigation found that no less than 40 veterans died while on unauthorized waiting lists, waiting to receive care that they never got. This is completely unacceptable. This legislation puts into place measures to ensure every facility is in compliance with VA scheduling policies and will withhold any awards or bonuses from any centers who fail to certify their compliance. Together with our new VA Secretary David Shulkin, whom we met with this week, I am confident that we will continue to create meaningful reforms for the VA. As we head into the Memorial Day weekend, this is just one way we can honor veterans and those who have fallen for us. 
HONORING HENRI TERMEER (Mr. MOULTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to honor a constituent, a friend, and a beloved member of our community, Henri Termeer. Henri was a resident of my hometown in Massachusetts and the retired CEO of Genzyme, the biotech firm credited with launching the Boston biotech revolution that now leads the globe. Henri has been described as the epitome of a renaissance man, and he embodied the nexus of business, culture, and civic responsibility. He also left a lasting imprint on those he loved. His 16yearold daughter, Adriana, referred to him as the giving tree because of the seemingly endless energy he devoted to the causes he believed in and the lives he touched. At dinner the night he passed away, Henri said to his guests: We are getting older and running out of runway here. We need new leaders now. Mr. Speaker, we would all do well to aspire to be the kind of thoughtful, passionate, and impactful leader Henri was. He saved countless lives, yet he was known for his modesty. Henri was one of the kindest men I have ever known, and we will miss him. 
WELCOME TO ROLLING THUNDER (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome the veterans from Rolling Thunder to Washington for their Memorial Day events. Veterans like Gus Dante of Branchburg, New Jersey, serve on Rolling Thunder’s national board, and every year he and others help organize events here in Washington to commemorate those brave Americans lost in war. For 30 years, Rolling Thunder’s voices and motorcycles have been roaring in Washington, and lawmakers and the new administration are listening. Veterans’ issues are front and center in the Halls of Congress, and Secretary Shulkin is reforming the Veterans Administration to restore the trust Rolling Thunder and all veterans demand. We must keep up the fight for the rights and benefits veterans have earned in the service to the Nation. I am proud to join with Rolling Thunder in introducing two important measures: legislation to end the 40mile rule for private care through the VA and legislation to display the POW/MIA flag on Federal properties. Mr. Speaker, on this commemorative Memorial Day weekend, let us all recall those who answered the call of service, especially those who did not return home. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BUDGET (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, the Trump budget is a disaster for the very people who the President claims he wants to assist. It is reckless, reprehensible, and regressive. The Trump budget balances itself on the backs of working families, middle class folks, senior citizens, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, and rural America. The Trump budget fails to invest in education and job training, it fails to invest in transportation and infrastructure, and it fails to invest in research and development. Instead, the Trump budget would cut Head Start, cut Medicaid, cut assistance to nursing homes, and it even cuts Meals on Wheels. This is all being done simply to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy and the welloff—lifestyles of the rich and shameless. The Trump budget is a disaster, and we are going to do everything possible to vote it down. 
PROTECTING YOUNG VICTIMS FROM SEXUAL ABUSE ACT OF 2017 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1973. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LANCE ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 352 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1973. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b0918 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1973) to prevent the sexual abuse of minors and amateur athletes by requiring the prompt reporting of sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities, and for other purposes, with Mr. POLIQUIN in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read for the first time. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today, we are able to continue our efforts in protecting children by passing legislation to protect young athletes from abuse. The country was shocked at the revelations in recent years concerning the ongoing abuse endured by young athletes at the hands of their coaches and trainers in USA Gymnastics and USA Swimming. These children were betrayed by people they trusted, by people they looked up to, and by people who had a duty to protect them. That is why I am pleased to be on the floor here today in support of the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. This bill imposes a requirement to report child abuse for those authorized by U.S. sport national governing bodies, such as USA Gymnastics and USA Swimming, to work with minor athletes or members of these governing bodies. As is the case with existing Federal mandatory reporting requirements, these individuals will be required to make a prompt report to law enforcement when they learn of facts that give reason to suspect that a child has suffered an incident of child abuse. This provision will ensure that the malfeasance on the part of national governing bodies, like USA Gymnastics, in failing to report allegations of abuse to law enforcement, never occurs again. The bill further strengthens existing civil remedies for victims of sexual abuse who wish to seek civil damages from their abusers. The bill clarifies that once a victim has established a harm occurred, the court will presume damages of $150,000. It relaxes the statute of limitations for victims. The 10 year period will now begin when the victim reasonably discovers the violation or harm, not when it accrues. It also extends the statute of limitations to 10 years after a legal disability is lifted. In other words, minors who are victims will have 10 years from the time they reach adulthood to file. Finally, the bill expands the authority of the national governing bodies to develop practices, policies, and procedures to prevent sexual abuse, and clarifies the duties of the bodies in developing these practices. Sports have always been a central aspect of American life. Sports teach our children about focus, teamwork, and leadership, and we should encourage our children to participate, to be a part of healthy competition; but, in doing so, we need to assure we keep these competitive atmospheres safe. I am pleased to see that the U.S. Olympic Committee has helped to establish a new organization called the Center for Safe Sport, to prevent and respond to emotional, physical, and sexual abuse of young athletes. I want to commend the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. B ROOKS ) for introducing this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1973, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act, for several reasons. Most importantly, this is a reasonable bill and is intended to help protect young athletes from abuse and preserve the sanctity of sports associated with the U.S. Olympic Committee, the organization responsible for preparing and training young athletes who might one day represent their country competitively all over the world. Children deserve to fully enjoy the innocence of their youth—by exploring the curiosities of the world, taking pleasure in the arts, and participating in sports—free from hurt, harm, or danger. Involvement in sports, and instruction and guidance from adult coaches, can positively influence a young person’s growth and development, as well as his or her potential for future success into adulthood. The sexual abuse of children and youth is intolerable in any text, and we must take appropriate measures to eliminate it from youth sports. Such exploitation betrays and harms young people, sometimes severely and irreparably. Young people look to adults to protect them and keep them safe. We all have a responsibility to do so. With H.R. 1973, we have an opportunity to ensure that individuals abide by this duty. Existing Federal law requires certain professionals, such as 
doctors, dentists, social workers, psychologists, teachers, and daycare workers, who regularly interact with children, to report suspected abuse to law enforcement. While our discussion of this legislation today may focus primarily on sexual abuse, H.R. 1973 will require adults who interact with young athletes, in connection to national governing bodies of various sports, to report suspected abuse of any kind. The need for this legislation is best illustrated by an ongoing scandal of widespread abuse and exploitation of young gymnasts over the course of 20 years within USA Gymnastics, a prominent governing body of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Many complaints of sexual and emotional abuse went unreported, allowing coaches, instructors, and doctors to repeatedly victimize gymnasts as young as 6 years old. The shocking failure of anyone to report accusations through law enforcement, or even keep track of complaints internally, made it possible for some of these predators to commit horrific acts at several gyms in several states. For example, a cloud of allegations of abuse surrounded one particular physician in Michigan going back as far as 1997. Regrettably, allegations against him were not reported to law enforcement until recently. Following the first public complaint against him in 2015, more than 100 women have filed complaints accusing him of sexual abuse, and he now faces more than 20 criminal charges in both Federal and State courts. While the USA Gymnastics scandal is unfortunate, let it be an example and incentive to prevent such pervasive abuse elsewhere. Accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to join me and my chairman in supporting this important legislation. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS ), the chief sponsor of this legislation. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1973, Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. Since my time as U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Indiana, I have been committed to battling child exploitation and abuse. Last year, I was shocked, along with much of the country, when The Indianapolis Star published an investigative piece that exposed troubling allegations of sexual abuse at USA Gymnastics programs across the country. According to their report, over the last 20 years, at least 368 young people, most Olympic hopefuls, were the victims of sexual abuse at the hands they trusted—coaches, trainers, doctors, and other adults associated with USA Gymnastics. They reported the abuse to USA Gymnastics, but, unfortunately, USA Gymnastics failed, in many cases, to report those allegations of abuse to law enforcement authorities. The article shed light on their stories and inspired the legislation that is before us today. According to more than 5,600 pages of USA Gymnastics records, released by The Indy Star, some of the 54 coaches, who had been accused of sexual abuse by young athletes in their care, weren’t banned from gymnastics until years after their history of abuse had been reported to and kept in complaint files by USA Gymnastics. One USA Gymnastics doctor already referenced, Dr. Nassar, stands accused of having abused young women and girls for more than 20 years. More than 100 women have come forward today to share their stories of abuse at his hands. I understand how challenging it is to share painful stories of sexual abuse, and I am proud of these brave gymnasts who shared their stories: stories that never should have happened, and stories that went inexcusably unanswered. Their stories demand our action and our attention, not only to provide victims with the justice denied to them for so long but also to protect future generations of Olympic hopefuls. I want to acknowledge the work of Senator FEINSTEIN of California, who is leading this bill in the Senate, and my colleagues in the bipartisan Women’s Caucus, specifically Representative FRANKEL of Florida. I want to commend the chair and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and other members of the committee, for taking the lead in protecting young victims from sexual abuse. Our legislation is an important step forward toward protecting these young athletes. It addresses that dangerous silence that, as The Indy Star investigative piece showed, plagued USA Gymnastics and other governing bodies of our Olympic sports—a silence that led to more girls being abused, hurt, and harmful coaches, and others, who faced little or no repercussions for their heinous actions. The abuse should have been, first and foremost, prevented. The system utterly failed when the abuse was not detected and not promptly reported. The U.S. Olympic Committee failed and must do better, and I commend them for their work now in working to do better. b0930 Our bill makes sure that national governing bodies entrusted with the health and wellbeing of athletes and future Olympians promptly report allegations of sexual abuse and other abuse to law enforcement authorities and implement much stronger policies and procedures to prevent this from happening again. Most importantly, I want to applaud the victims who shared their story to protect others. I really thank them for their courage and for changing the lives of not only young athletes today, but those in the future. I urge passage of the bill, and at this time, I thank the chairman and, again, the ranking member for their leadership. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL ). Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for yielding. Today, I rise as the proud cosponsor of this important legislation with my friend and colleague from Indiana, SUSAN BROOKS . I want to thank her for her work on this, the Judiciary leadership, and, of course, Senator DIANE FEINSTEIN . Mr. Chair, imagine you are a 10year old girl and you have a dream. Your dream is to stand on the podium at a summer Olympics with a medal around your neck, and you are saluting the American flag. You are willing to do a lot for that. You are willing to give up all the kinds of things that little girls like to do in their youth. You are willing to spend hours practicing your skills, to get bumps and bruises, but it doesn’t stop you. Your parents trust your dream to a coach you call ‘‘Grandpa.’’ Here is the thing: Your dream becomes a nightmare. The Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act comes after devastating reports that at least 368 gymnasts have been sexually abused by their coaches and trainers over the course of 20 years. It is almost unimaginable. Although USA Gymnastics received allegations of abuse, they turned a blind eye. Why? Because it was more important to them to win medals and protect their star coaches. We have read and heard lots of stories. I am going to give you an example of one, while trying to protect the confidentiality. By the time she was in seventh grade, our gymnast has developed an eating disorder, coping with the fact that the coach she called Grandpa made her hate her body. By the time she got to college, she had difficulty maintaining relationships, believing that she would never like being touched or physically embraced by others. Here is a postscript. Over more than a decade, the coach we call Grandpa was able to move from gym to gym abusing girls and recording videos of them. He installed secret cameras in changing rooms and recorded 469 videos of gymnasts, many of whom were naked. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2 minutes. Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Chair, to continue this, we have to ask this question: Could these young girls have been spared this trauma had proper procedures been in place? And, of course, today our answer is, hopefully, yes. This legislation is a step in a long journey to change the culture around 
sexual abuse. Too often institutions, whether they are our colleges, our military, or, here, in this case, an athletic organization, prioritize preserving their reputations and their brands over the people they protect. This legislation will require national sports bodies like USA Gymnastics to file reports of abuse as soon as possible. It will establish mandatory training and require the enforcement of policies preventing, reporting, and addressing these kinds of allegations because protecting our athletes must be a priority. Let their dreams come true. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MEEHAN). Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to express my admiration and deep appreciation for the gentlewoman from Indiana for her leadership on this most important bill. This gives us a chance to do something, which is to give a voice to those victims who have suffered in silence and yet had the courage to come forward and allow others to appreciate the depth of the impact that they have suffered, as well as an opportunity for us to assure that this kind of pattern doesn’t repeat itself again. We know it is a pattern because we have, as has been aptly demonstrated by the speakers before me, stories of young women who have been victimized because they enter a trusting relationship—one between a coach and a person in which that power dynamic is so unique, the young person putting their future in the hands—which is exploited by that person superior in the relationship. So we now have chance to assure that that trust is not further impacted. But it is not just that relationship; it is the longterm implications of it which are so damaging. Working with the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape, we have come to appreciate victims and how the psychological impacts, including things like substance abuse and other kinds of psychological disorders, last for years, and by the courage of coming forward, it does not necessarily end that impact on them. In fact, it is not just situations like coach and athlete. All kinds of trusting relationships can create a dynamic— one including something that I am currently working on, massage parlors—in which individuals who put themselves in a compromising position find themselves assaulted. Most recently, I introduced the Duty to Report Act, addressing that kind of a violation of that trusting relationship. These are examples of opportunities for us to address, once and for all, the implications of people who are allowed to move from one situation to another when reports come forward and stop. We call that pass the trash. Today, it is time for our body to put forward the kind of legislation that will assure that there is a duty to report so, along with due process, there can be an internal investigation to assure and reporting requirements so that these individuals are not able to victimize future young athletes, future people who put themselves in the position of trust. Mr. Chair, I applaud my colleagues who support this legislation, and I ask that we do so with a strong voice from this House. The CHAIR. The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. PAULSEN) assumed the chair. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed with amendments in which the concurrence of the House is requested, a bill of the House of the following title: 
H.R. 1238. An act to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Health Affairs responsible for coordinating the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security related to food, agriculture, and veterinary defense against terrorism, and for other purposes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Committee will resume its sitting. 
PROTECTING YOUNG VICTIMS FROM SEXUAL ABUSE ACT OF 2017 The Committee resumed its sitting. The CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ). Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1973, which aims to strengthen protections against child victims of sexual abuse. I am a parent. In fact, today, with me, I have my son, Hudson, and one of my daughters, Ava. Sadly, over the course of the past couple of years, countless stories of young athletes being abused, including in Indiana, have revealed glaring inadequacies in our law. These stories, many about coaches and doctors and trainers and other adults who have abused their positions of authority and trust to exploit young athletes, are appalling and, as a parent, gut wrenching. Every one of these kids deserved better. This bill aims to ensure that acts of suspected child abuse are promptly reported to an organization’s national governing body to make sure that these cases are immediately disclosed to local or Federal law enforcement authorities. Short of this requirement being codified into law, predatory individuals can continue perpetrating horrific crimes against young athletes with relative impunity. In addition, this bill requires national governing bodies to develop specific policies and procedures for reporting sexual abuse cases to law enforcement and to keep track of individuals who leave one facility due to complaints and then go to another facility to repeat that abuse elsewhere. I want to thank my colleague from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS ) for her important work on this legislation—she is my kids’ second favorite Member of Congress—and for her hard work on this important bill to protect kids all across America from abuse. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE), the ranking member on the prime subcommittee on the House Judiciary Committee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding. I thank the chairman of this committee and the manager of this bill, and, particularly, I want to express my appreciation to the bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation—the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS ), the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL )—for coming together around a concept of continuing to work to protect our children; and where we can find bipartisanship, that is really very special as relates to the message to the American people. The Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act requires that personnel and employees of national governing bodies recognized by the U.S. Olympic Committee report suspected incidents of child abuse, including sexual abuse, to law enforcement. The importance of this is to cease, end, stop, never have it again for those victims— never report or hold it for years and years—who are impacted psychologically and impacted for the rest of their life. Really, that is what has been happening in years past. This bill is intended to protect young athletes who, with great expectation and excitement and challenge and wonderment and aspirations for the Olympics, in their early years, desire to serve their Nation; because when they put their bodies through this rigorous engagement in sport day after day, week after week, month after month, hour after hour, minute after minute, second after second, and deny themselves other extracurricular activities, they do it for the passion of the sport, for their recognition of excellence, but also to go to the Olympics and make their Nation proud. b0945 And so what we have put them through with respect to not protecting them against sexual assaults severely undermines, again, and irreparably harms them. With H.R. 1973, we have an opportunity to ensure that that never happens again. The need for this legislation is best illustrated by the ongoing scandal of 
widespread abuse and exploitation of young gymnasts over the course of 20 years within USA Gymnastics—a prominent governing body of the U.S. Olympic Committee—in particular, by a physician starting back in 1997 who engaged in such activities. Allegations against him were not reported to law enforcement until recently; and following the first public complaint against him in 2015, more than 100 women filed complaints accusing him of sexual abuse, and he now faces more than 20 criminal charges in Federal and State courts. Again, this legislation is to turn the light on those who have quietly abused these young men and women and, as well, done it with impunity because no vehicle was provided for these young people to be able to ensure that they would not be assaulted again. The integrity that we bring to this process with this legislation, the comfort that we give to families and parents when they entrust their children to those who are coaches, doctors, leaders of teams, sponsors of teams is vitally important. And the protections of this bill, of reporting and ensuring that the light continues to stay on and the darkness never comes for that young athlete who seeks that golden platform or that first place or second place or third place, or even to participate, that they can do it with the affirmation that the Nation believes in their protection and their security and that they should never, never, never face this alone. I rise to support the legislation, H.R. 1973, and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ). Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I would like to first express my thanks and appreciation as well to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS ), who is bringing this legislation forward, H.R. 1973, of which I am a proud cosponsor. The bill is the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. Every year, Mr. Chair, thousands of amateur athletes begin their journey with the goal of one day being able to represent the United States at the Olympics. This journey is often filled with years of dedication, of sacrifice, of multiple setbacks, all in the hopes of rising to the top of their craft. Unfortunately, for some, this journey has also been scarred by sexual abuse, and often this abuse comes from those who are closest to our young athletes. These are the individuals that have been entrusted by families all around the country to look after them, to take care of them, to look after these loved ones during their training. The bill today in the House that we are taking up is a step in the right direction to help ensure that athletes are better protected. It requires mandatory and immediate reporting of incidents of child sexual abuse to both local and Federal law enforcement. No organization should be able to stand idly by when a child is placed in harm’s way and becomes a victim. The bill also directs our amateur athletic governing bodies to develop and implement rigorous training and oversight practices to prevent abuse of athletes in the future. Mr. Chair, our amateur athletes and their families should never ever have to worry about their children being abused by those who are closest to them, often in a very trusted relationship. We need to pass this critical legislation to give families the peace of mind and prevent abuse. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chair, let me close by saying that protecting young victims from sexual abuse is a necessary measure that will help ensure that young athletes in this country are able to pursue their athletic dreams in a safe environment and free of exploitation and abuse. This bill imposes an affirmative duty on coaches, trainers, instructors, doctors, and the like to protect the young athletes who have been entrusted to their tutelage. This bill establishes remedies for those who might be harmed, and this bill mandates training and oversight to encourage compliance, vigilance, and protection. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for facilitating the prompt consideration of this bill, and the Judiciary Committee. I also want to recognize the leadership of Senator FEINSTEIN , the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who authored the Senate version of this bill and who has been the leading voice in Congress in demanding we address these issues. Finally, I note that this important bipartisan legislation is supported by many advocacy groups including the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children; the National Children’s Alliance; the National Center for Victims of Crime; Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network; and the United States Olympic Committee, as well as several of its national governing bodies. For the foregoing reasons, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1973, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. CONYERS , Ms. JACKSON LEE, and all of those who have spoken in support of this bill this morning, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. It is exactly as it has been described. It is an important moment for us, in a bipartisan consensus that we have reached, to protect our young athletes. It has been articulated well, the purpose behind the bill, and it is a proud moment for all of us as we stand for these young athletes to defend them as they perform and use their Godgiven talents that make our Nation so proud. So, without belaboring the point, Mr. Chairman, I just want to commend, again, Mrs. BROOKS for introducing this important legislation, and I also urge all of my colleagues to support it. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1973—Protecting Young Victims From Sexual Abuse Act. Since my time as a US Attorney and federal prosecutor, I have been committed to battling child exploitation and abuse. Last year, I was shocked—along with much of the country—when the Indianapolis Star published an investigative piece that exposed troubling allegations of sexual abuse at USA Gymnastics programs across the country. According to their report, over the last 20 years, at least 368 young people—some Olympic hopefuls—were the victims of sexual abuse at the hands of adults they trusted— coaches, trainers, doctors and other adults associated with USA Gymnastics. They reported the abuse to USA Gymnastics—and unfortunately, USA Gymnastics failed, in many cases, to report their abuse to law enforcement authorities. The article shed light on their stories and inspired the legislation that is before us today. According to the more than 5,600 pages of USA Gymnastics records released by the Indy Star, some of the 54 coaches who had been accused of sexual abuse by young athletes in their care weren’t banned from gymnastics until years after their history of abuse had been reported to and kept in complaint files by USA Gymnastics. One USA Gymnastics doctor, Dr. Nassar— abused young women and girls for more than 20 years, and more than 100 women have come forward today to share their stories of abuse at his hands. I understand how challenging it is to share painful stories of sexual abuse, and I am proud of the brave gymnasts who have shared their stories. Stories that should never have happened, and stories that went inexcusably unanswered. Their stories demand our attention and action. Not only to provide victims with the justice denied to them for so long, but also to protect future generations of Olympic hopefuls. I want to acknowledge the work of Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN of California who is leading this bill in the Senate, and my colleagues in the Bipartisan Women’s Caucus who joined me to offer the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. Our legislation is an important step towards protecting our young athletes. Our legislation addresses this dangerous silence that, as the Indy Star investigative piece showed, plagued the USA Gymnastics. A silence that led to more girls being abused, hurt, and harmful coaches who faced little to no repercussions for their heinous actions. The abuse should have been first and foremost, prevented. The system utterly failed when the abuse was not detected, and not promptly reported. The Olympic community failed and must do better. Our bill makes sure that national governing bodies entrusted with the health and well being of young athletes and future Olympians promptly report any allegations of sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities and implement stronger policies and procedures to prevent this from happening again. 
I applaud S ENATOR FEINSTEIN and my colleagues in the House who joined the effort to move this important legislation forward, and applaud the victims who shared their story to protect others. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–20.

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . JOHNSON OF  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part A of House Report 115–152. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman GOODLATTE , I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 2, strike line 16, and all that follows through line 3 on page 3, and insert the following: ‘‘(9) the term ‘covered individual’ means an adult who is authorized by a national governing body or a member of a national governing body to interact with a minor or amateur athlete at an amateur sports organization facility or at any event sanctioned by a national governing body or a member of a national governing body; ‘‘(10) the term ‘event’ includes travel, practice, competition, and health or medical treatment; and ‘‘(11) the terms ‘amateur athlete’, ‘amateur sports organization’, and ‘national governing body’ have the meanings given such terms in section 220501(b) of title 36, United States Code.’’. Page 4, line 19, strike ‘‘file’’ and insert ‘‘filed’’. Page 7, strike line 16 and all that follows through line 25, and insert the following: ‘‘(C) reasonable procedures designed to avoid oneonone interactions between an amateur athlete who is a minor and an adult (who is not the minor’s legal guardian) at an amateur sports organization facility, at any event sanctioned by a national governing body, or any event sanctioned by a member of a national governing body, without being observable or interruptible by another adult, except where the safety and welfare of the minor requires; and’’. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 352, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am happy to introduce this manager’s amendment to H.R. 1973, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. This amendment is very simple. It defines who is covered by the mandatory reporting requirement in the underlying bill. The definition harmonizes language with the underlying statute, defining this class not by location, but by simply keeping the jurisdictional reference where it belongs: in the national governing body or a member of a national governing body. The amendment also defines the term ‘‘event’’ to include travel, practice, competition, and health or medical treatment. This definition is important as events in USA Gymnastics revealed abuse by USA Gymnastics’ team doctor Larry Nassar, who molested dozens of young girls under the guise of medical treatment. Moreover, other allegations of abuse show that it sometimes took place during travel to various competitions. The amendment also clarifies duties of national governing bodies. Under the amendment, national governing bodies must implement reasonable procedures designed to avoid oneonone interactions between minors and adults that are not within an observable or interruptible distance. This amendment assures that the 47 different national governing bodies can implement procedures that make sense, given the sport they cover, the reach of their influence, and the resources available to them. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the bill or the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman and point out that this amendment addresses the provisions in the bill concerning one onone interactions between young athletes and the adults who work with them. The existing version of the bill requires the national governing bodies instruct coaches, instructors, doctors, and the like to avoid oneonone situations with the young athletes that cannot be observed or interrupted by another adult. Under the proposed change, national governing bodies will be required to institute and enforce reasonable procedures designed to avoid oneonone interactions between young athletes and their coaches, instructors, and doctors that cannot be observed or interrupted by another adult. Mr. GOODLATTE ’s amendment also harmonizes language used in the bill with language in the underlying statute and makes technical and conforming changes. I support this amendment and the changes it makes to enhance H.R. 1973, and I look forward to further discussions of these provisions with the Senate, with the goal of producing a consensus bill for enactment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to join the gentleman from Louisiana and the ranking member from Michigan in support of this amendment. I think it has an underlying premise that we should all celebrate and attempt to ensure that it is in place. I, too, agree that I look forward to reconciling the House and Senate bill, but the amendment specifically addresses the provisions in the bill concerning oneonone interactions between young athletes and the adults who they work with; and I believe the clear understanding that we all hope can be implemented is that we don’t have oneonone interactions without overall supervision or other kids or other adult participants so that we do not create an atmosphere where a child can be intimidated or abused. Under the proposed change, national governing bodies will be required to institute and enforce reasonable procedures designed to avoid oneonone interactions between young athletes and their coaches, instructors, and doctors that cannot be observed or interrupted by another adult. First of all, we know that the expanse of sports is expanding. There are so many new sports, so many new opportunities for adults, many committed and dedicated adults, but the real issue is: Let’s protect the children. Mr. Chair, I rise to support the Goodlatte amendment. b1000 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, in closing, I echo what has been 
said already, and I appreciate the comments of my colleagues and acknowledge, again, that the manager’s amendment is very simple. It simply seeks to clear up language and define these terms. It is a necessary alteration to the bill, and I encourage our colleagues to support the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . COSTA  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part A of House Report 115–152. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 352, the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, as a cochair of the Victims’ Rights Caucus, along with Congressman TEDPOE, we have over 70 members, bipartisan, to focus on protecting victims of crime. We also try to ensure that we protect the VOCA funding that goes for very worthwhile efforts for organizations throughout the country and to recognize and honor every year those who stand out on behalf of victims of crime. I want to commend the chairman and the ranking member for advancing this legislation, as well as my Senate colleagues, because there is a companion piece of legislation that is attempting to address this horrible issue in which you have so often young athletes— Olympiccaliber athletes—some who actually have participated in the Olympics, who, at a very young age, find themselves victims of these horrific crimes, through no fault of their own. Sexual assault, in any form, is a horrible crime and it leaves lasting damage to its victims. Sadly, some victims of assault are children who may be incapable of truly understanding what is happening to them at the time. However, years later, when this poor child comes to understand what happened, they are faced with the reality that someone who is supposed to be looking after their wellbeing actually betrayed them. This leaves real and very lasting damage that can take decades, if not years, for the person to deal with. In some instances, sexual assault victims may not discover their injuries or the violation until adulthood, years after the abuse happened, years after the processing of their own internal trauma, years after feeling strong enough finally to go public. A perfect example of this is in child pornography. How is a young child supposed to find, process, and accuse someone of a crime that they simply didn’t even know existed? There are legitimate constitutional debates dealing with the criminal and civil process. We understand that. Current and future legal scholars will debate those. I am not a lawyer; I am a farmer. But as a farmer, I know we should be able to agree on one simple principle, and that principle is that these victims deserve their day in court, they deserve due process, and they deserve their time to face the person who assaulted them and to ask their fellow citizens or a judge for justice. It is our responsibility to do what we can to protect child victims and to ensure that they have access to the courts. That is what this amendment is all about. Mr. Chairman, I want to, in the effort of comity, offer this amendment, but I will ask to respectfully withdraw the amendment. This is an issue that is not going to go away. I know there are different perceptions on how we deal with this. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. COSTA. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I appreciate the gentleman’s remarks and his support for this important legislation. Victims should, of course, have reasonable opportunity to seek justice and face their accusers in court. This bill is a good one and fair to all parties, and I look forward to working with the gentleman to get it to the President’s desk. Mr. COSTA. I will accept that and continue to work with the gentleman and Chairman GOODLATTE from Virginia, because, at the end of the day, to have some success and to move this forward, we are going to have to have reconciliation between the Senate bill and the House bill in how this is treated. I would hope that we would gain that agreement, and then we could move the legislation for signature. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . O’HALLERAN  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part A of House Report 115–152. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 7, line 25, strike ‘‘and’’ at the end. Page 8, insert after line 10 the following: ‘‘(E) requiring dedicated information and resources, which may include sexual assault hotlines and victims’ support resources, to be clearly listed on the national governing body’s official website; and’’. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 352, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, as a former law enforcement officer, I know all too well what happens when our institutions fail to protect our most valued and treasured among us: our children. The recent reports of young athletes experiencing sexual assault and abuse at the hands of trusted adults are not just abhorrent, they are unacceptable. Last year, tragically, one of our own young gymnasts in Mesa, Arizona, came forward after years of abuse by a coach at his gym. We must do better. No child anywhere should face the risk of abuse. That is why I am proud to support the bill before us today, which will go a long way in protecting our young athletes. My bipartisan amendment, which is cosponsored by Congresswoman SINEMA  and Congressman BIGGS, simply builds on the underlying bill’s spirit by requiring national governing bodies to clearly list information and resources, which may include sexual assault hotlines and victim support resources, on their official websites. As a former cop who has dealt with vulnerable victims, I know from my experience that resources like sexual assault hotlines are a critical tool between victims, families, local health providers, and law enforcement. Requiring governing bodies, like USA Gymnastics, to clearly list this type of information on their websites is an important step forward in ensuring support for victims and their families. As adults and parents, we place our children in the trusted hands of coaches, trainers, and others when we support and encourage their involvement in sports. We all know sports play such a critical role in so many of our communities. It is where we learn about teamwork, resilience, hard work, and perseverance. These spaces should be safe for children to learn, grow, and develop as healthy athletes and adults. We have a moral obligation to ensure our kids have protection and access to the information they deserve. My commonsense amendment helps do just that. I thank Representative SINEMA and Representative BIGGS for their support on this amendment, as well as the sponsors of H.R. 1973 for their good work on this important bill. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to this commonsense amendment, as has just been articulated. 
The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Mr. O’HALLERAN  and Mr. BIGGS for offering this amendment. It will help to prevent abuse at these national governing bodies and, as stated, it will encourage children to report abuse when they are able to quickly and easily access this information. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ). Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. O’HALLERAN for yielding and for his leadership on this important issue. Sexual abuse is abhorrent. It is particularly abhorrent when it is conducted by an individual in a position of authority: a coach, a trainer, a teacher. The community of Mesa, Arizona, which Mr. BIGGS and I represent, was rocked by a tragic event in which a young athlete was abused for at least 3 years before receiving help. Had he or other young athletes experiencing similar nightmares had access to resources and support, perhaps the nightmare could have ended sooner, perhaps it could have been prevented. Our bipartisan amendment is simple. It builds on a very good bipartisan bill by requiring governing bodies to list dedicated information and resources for victims and families on official websites. No individual should suffer from sexual abuse. No family should go without support when they are in need. I thank the two gentlemen, my friends from Arizona, Mr. O’HALLERAN  and Mr. BIGGS, for cosponsoring this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on our amendment and to support the underlying bill. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his courtesies. I want to enthusiastically congratulate and thank the gentlemen and gentlewoman from Arizona for responding to their constituents and answering a question positively about protecting our young people. I spoke earlier today about what happens with young people and their aspirations when they engage in sports. They want to win, but they also want to, if you will, to impress adults and to show that they can do the very best that they can do. So I want to congratulate them for this amendment that advances the purposes and goals of protecting young victims from sexual abuse by requiring the national governing bodies to include resources and information regarding sexual assault and having sexual assault hotlines and other victim support services on their websites. With this new technology, it will be at their fingertips. They don’t have to, in essence, expose themselves. They can get this information and readily access the very people that will help them. So I want to congratulate the manager, Mr. CONYERS , and, of course, the chairman of the committee and the proponents of the underlying bill. I want to congratulate Mr. O’HALLERAN . His efforts here are to be commended, and I thank him for this insightful amendment to the legislation. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. MCCARTHY ) having assumed the chair, Mr. POLIQUIN , Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1973) to prevent the sexual abuse of minors and amateur athletes by requiring the prompt reporting of sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 352, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POLIQUIN ). Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
b1015 PROTECTING AGAINST CHILD EXPLOITATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 352, I call up the bill (H.R. 1761) to amend title 18, United States Code, to criminalize the knowing consent of the visual depiction, or live transmission, of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky). Pursuant to House Resolution 352, in lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–19 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 1761 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act of 2017’’. 
Section 2251 of title 18, United States Code, is amended— (1) by amending subsections (a) and (b) to read as follows: ‘‘(a) Any person who, in a circumstance described in subsection (f), knowingly— ‘‘(1) employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces a minor to engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, or transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct; ‘‘(2) produces or causes to be produced a visual depiction of a minor engaged in any sexually explicit conduct where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and such visual depiction is of such conduct; ‘‘(3) transmits or causes to be transmitted a live visual depiction of a minor engaged in any sexually explicit conduct; ‘‘(4) has a minor assist any other person to engage in any sexually explicit conduct during the commission of an offense set forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection; or ‘‘(5) transports any minor in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce with the intent that such minor be used in the production or live transmission of a visual depiction of a minor engaged in any sexually explicit conduct, shall be punished as provided under subsection (e). ‘‘(b) Any parent, legal guardian, or person having custody or control of a minor who, in a circumstance described in subsection (f), knowingly permits such minor to engage in, or to assist any other person to engage in, sexually explicit conduct knowing that a visual depiction of such conduct will be produced or transmitted shall be punished as provided under subsection (e).’’; (2) in subsection (c)— (A) in paragraph (1)— (i) by striking ‘‘employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in, or who has a minor assist any other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct’’ and inserting ‘‘engages in any conduct described in paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (a)’’; and (ii) by striking ‘‘, for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct,’’; (B) in paragraph (2)(A), by inserting after ‘‘transported’’ the following: ‘‘or transmitted’’; and 
(C) in paragraph (2)(B), by inserting after ‘‘transports’’ the following; ‘‘or transmits’’; (3) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(f) The circumstances referred to in subsections (a) and (b) are— ‘‘(1) that the person knows or has reason to know that such visual depiction will be— ‘‘(A) transported or transmitted using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce; ‘‘(B) transported or transmitted in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce; or ‘‘(C) mailed; ‘‘(2) the visual depiction was produced or transmitted using materials that have been mailed, or shipped or transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer; ‘‘(3) such visual depiction has actually been— ‘‘(A) transported or transmitted using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce; ‘‘(B) transported or transmitted in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce; or ‘‘(C) mailed; or ‘‘(4) any part of the offense occurred in a territory or possession of the United States or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. ‘‘(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no criminal charge under subsection (a)(3) may be brought against an electronic communication service provider or remote computing service provider unless such provider has intentionally transmitted or caused to be transmitted a visual depiction with actual knowledge that such depiction is of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, nor may any such criminal charge be brought if barred by the provisions of section 2258B.’’. 
SEC. 3. LIMITED LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN PERSONS WHEN RESPONDING TO SEARCH WARRANTS OR OTHER LEGAL PROCESS. 
Section 2258B of title 18, United States Code, is amended— (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ‘‘from the response to a search warrant or other legal process or’’ before ‘‘from the performance’’; and (2) in subsection (b)(2)(C), by inserting ‘‘the response to a search warrant or other legal process or to’’ before ‘‘the performance of any responsibility’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. After 1 hour of debate, it shall be in order to consider the further amendment printed in part B of House Report 115–152, if offered by the Member designated in the report, which shall be considered read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1761. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1761, the Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act of 2017, and urge my colleagues to do the same. I would like to note that May is National Missing Children’s Month and today marks National Missing Children’s Day. It is an honor to be on the floor here today as we continue our mission to protect these innocent victims. We have made great strides toward ending child exploitation. However, gaps still exist in our laws that are contrary to Congress’ goal of protecting children and criminalizing the production of images of child sexual abuse. H.R. 1761 takes necessary steps to close an unfortunate loophole created by a Fourth Circuit decision in United States v. PalominoCoronado—a case in which a defendant was able to walk free from Federal conviction despite photographic evidence he had engaged in the sexual abuse of a 7yearold child. On May 3, 2012, Prince George’s County police officers responded to a home in Laurel, Maryland, based on a report of a missing 7yearold child known as ‘‘B.H.’’ Officers found the child at the fence that separated her house and her neighbor’s house. Upon investigation, it was uncovered that the neighbor, Anthony PalominoCoronado, a 19 yearold male, had sexually molested the child. At trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of knowingly employing, using, persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing a minor in sexually explicit conduct, for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of that conduct—in other words, for the production of child pornography. The defendant appealed his conviction, alleging insufficient evidence. Incredibly, the Fourth Circuit vacated the defendant’s conviction, finding there was insufficient evidence the defendant’s sexual abuse of the 7year old girl was ‘‘for the purpose of’’ creating an image of such conduct. The court found that, though the defendant engaged in sexual conduct with a child, ‘‘the fact that only one image was produced militates against finding that his intent in doing so was to take a picture.’’ Essentially, the court decided that the defendant had engaged in sexual conduct with a 7yearold and taken a picture but had not engaged in sexual conduct with a 7yearold to take a picture. To me, this is a preposterous, offensive result. Under the Fourth Circuit’s reasoning in Palomino, a defendant could admit to sexually abusing a child, and memorializing the conduct, but could argue that he should, nonetheless, escape Federal conviction because he lacked the requisite purpose or specific intent, prior to initiating the sexual abuse. Indeed, defense attorneys have begun to raise these Palomino defenses in other courts. In response to Palomino, H.R. 1761 establishes additional bases of liability to the crime of production of child pornography. Specifically, the bill clarifies existing law by prohibiting the knowing production of, or knowingly causing the production of, a visual depiction of a real minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Additionally, H.R. 1761 amends current law to prohibit the knowing transmission of, or knowingly causing the transmission of, a live visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct while also criminalizing the knowing creation of the visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. This language will serve to fix this judicially created loophole and ensure our court system will not have to spend time evaluating this meritless defense and will make certain predators such as this will not be able to escape Federal consequences. Mr. Speaker, with this bill, Congress’ intent is clear. We must continue to protect our children, the most vulnerable and innocent members of society. I commend the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ), a member of the Judiciary Committee, for introducing this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ) may control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and rise in opposition to this bill. Mr. Speaker, this bill restructures section 2251 of title 18 of the United States Code as apparently requested by the unit at the Department of Justice that enforces the laws against child pornography. H.R. 1761 is intended to address limitations in the prosecution of cases pursuant to section 2251, as identified by the Department. While we all agree that no child pornography offense should go unpunished, we cannot overlook the consequences of mandatory minimum sentencing. Section 2251(a) prohibits the use of a child to produce child pornography and related conduct, including overseas production and advertising child pornography. Pursuant to this bill, two new offenses would be added to this section to prohibit the production of child pornography and the transmission of live depictions of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct, such as live streaming abuse online. This measure would also modify the existing offense that prohibits having a minor assist in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing or transmitting child pornography. As amended, this offense would prohibit 
having a minor assist in sexually explicit conduct that violates each of the three newly enumerated production offenses, except the transportation of a minor for use in child pornography production. In addition, it would amend the prohibition against the production of child pornography abroad to forbid the live transmission of child pornography produced abroad. The jurisdictional requirement for each of the offenses enumerated in section 2251, except the production of child pornography abroad, would be codified in a separate subsection. Other portions of the bill would be modified to follow the restructure of the statute for consistency. Unfortunately, current law sets forth a series of mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for production of child pornography offenses. Firsttime offenses are punishable by mandatory imprisonment of at least 15 years; offenders with a prior conviction face mandatory imprisonment for at least 25 years; and offenders with two or more prior convictions must be sentenced to imprisonment of at least 35 years. By modifying and expanding section 2251 to include several new ways in which to violate the prohibition against the production of child pornography, the bill would subject new classes of defendants to mandatory minimum sentences. Although the bill does not establish new mandatory minimum sentences, it would—in this way—expand the application of the existing mandatory minimums, which I oppose. Mandatory minimums have been studied extensively and found to distort rational sentencing systems, discriminate against minorities, waste taxpayers’ money, and violate common sense. Under mandatory minimum sentences, regardless of the nature and circumstances surrounding the offense, the role of the offender in the particular crime, and the history and characteristics of the offender, a judge must impose a sentence set by the legislature. Even if everyone involved in a case— from the arresting officer, prosecutor, and judge to the victim—believes that the mandatory minimum would be an unjust sentence for a particular defendant in a case, it still must be imposed. Mandatory minimum sentences are the wrong way to determine punishment under this or any other statute. During the Judiciary Committee’s consideration of this bill, the committee rejected an amendment that would have eliminated the applicable mandatory minimums in the current statute but would still have allowed judges to sentence these offenders to lengthy sentences up to the existing statutory maximums. Because those changes were not made, the bill continues to present problems with mandatory minimums. Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I must oppose this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1030 Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY). Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue to help save those who have been trafficked across not only just America, but around the world. Mr. Speaker, they didn’t list her name in the report, and that makes sense. It all happened before she even reached the age of 16. So to protect her identity, they called her Tonya. She ran away from home and ended up living with a man they called Eddie. Eddie was the stepdad of one of her classmates. Tonya and Eddie started a relationship. Tonya felt that she really loved him. Eddie took advantage of that, and he pressured Tonya into a life no child should have to live. Tonya was saved in large part by luck. A tip to the police led to action by the Federal special agent. And now Eddie is behind bars finishing the second year of his 12year prison sentence. Meanwhile, Tonya is just trying to return to a normal life. Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say this story wasn’t true, that these fictitious names didn’t reflect hard reality. I wish I could say it was isolated. I wish I could say that this type of thing doesn’t happen here in America, but it does. It repeats itself with different details even more disturbing than Tonya’s story in towns and cities across our Nation. It is not just sex trafficking. It is forced labor. It is exploitation. It is slavery. And every single instance cries out against the moral truth written on every human heart. Now, the numbers are staggering. 20.9 million people are trafficked globally. Of that number, over a quarter are children. The majority are pressed to work for little to no wages. And 4.5 million of these people are victims of forced sexual exploitation. Here in America, there were 7,572 cases of human trafficking reported in 2016. That is an increase of 35 percent over just the year before. My home State of California is particularly dire. Of all the cases in the Nation, 1,323 come from California. Though we need no explanation for why we are passing antitrafficking and exploitation legislation today, I think it helps that we understand the magnitude of this evil. We have, in this body, voted on 11 bills so far. Today we will vote on two more by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS ) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ). Altogether, these bills address many aspects of this problem: international trafficking, recording and transmission of child pornography, abuse uncovered on the U.S. Olympic teams, the handling of trauma cases in our justice system. I don’t believe that these bills alone will end human trafficking or exploitation in and of themselves, but they will help. They will help prevent these crimes, they will help the victims recover, and they will bring us closer to a world where every person, especially those who need us most, won’t be abused but will be truly loved. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work in this effort. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1761. I first want to point out that the case outlined by the chair of the Judiciary Committee that failed in Federal court could have been brought in State court and the defendant would have been subjected to extremely long, lengthy prison time for the heinous conduct that he had participated in. Mr. Speaker, this legislation expands the use of preexisting mandatory minimum sentences. Although the bill does not technically create new mandatory minimums, it does expose additional defendants to preexisting mandatory minimum sentences of 15, 25, and 35 years. While I support the underlying goal of punishing sex offenders—and they should be punished harshly—the use of mandatory minimums has time and time again been shown to be inappropriate. This expansion of mandatory minimum sentences comes on the heels of the Attorney General’s memorandum of May 12, 2017, which has been roundly criticized for directing all Federal prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges and maximum sentences, to include mandatory minimum sentences. This directive takes away from Federal prosecutors and judges the ability to individually assess the unique circumstances of each case, including any factors that may mitigate against imposing mandatory minimum sentences. This law is particularly appalling because it would apply to people who I think we should all agree should not be subject to these long mandatory minimum sentences. I am talking about teenagers. Teenage sexting is widespread. Under this law, teenagers who engage in consensual conduct and send photos of a sexual nature to their friends or even to each other may be prosecuted and the judge must sentence them to at least 15 years in prison. The law explicitly states that the mandatory minimums will apply equally to an attempt or a conspiracy. That means if a teenager attempts to obtain a photo of sexually explicit conduct by requesting it from his teenage girlfriend, the judge must sentence that teenager to prison for at least 15 years for making such an attempt. If a teenager goads a friend to ask a teenager to take a sexually explicit image of herself, just by asking, he could be guilty of conspiracy or attempt, and the judge must sentence that teenager to at least 15 years in prison. 
Under the Federal code, the term ‘‘sexually explicit conduct’’ includes actual or simulated conduct. That means if a teenager asks another teenager for a photo simulating sex, even if the minor is fully clothed, that attempt would violate the law and the teenager must get a sentence of at least 15 years mandatory minimum for making that attempt. This law does not allow the judge to consider whether or not the conduct may have been consensual between minors. This circumstance is irrelevant when the sentence is mandatory. For decades now, the extensive research and evidence has demonstrated that mandatory minimum sentences fail to reduce crime, discriminate against minorities, waste the taxpayers’ money, and often require a judge to impose sentences so bizarre that they violate common sense. Unfortunately, there are already too many mandatory minimums in the Federal code. If we ever expect to do anything about the problem and actually address this major driver of mass incarceration, the first step we have to take is to stop passing new mandatory minimums or bills that expand existing mandatory minimums. Mr. Speaker, we have to recognize that mandatory minimums in the code did not get there all at once. They got there one at a time, each part of a larger bill, which, on balance, might seem like a good idea. Therefore, the only way to stop passing new mandatory minimums is to stop passing bills that contain or broaden the application of mandatory minimums. Giving lip service to the suggestion that you would have preferred that the mandatory minimum had not been in the bill and then voting for the bill anyway not only creates that new mandatory minimum, but it also guarantees that mandatory minimums will be included in the next crime bill. Mr. Speaker, this bill would not be controversial if it did not contain mandatory minimums, but, unfortunately, it does. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1761. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am honored today to speak in support of my legislation, the Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act, which aims to close a courtcreated loophole, and as the title suggests, further protect our children from predators. When I first arrived to Congress after almost 20 years of litigating constitutional law cases and drafting legislation for municipalities to control the proliferation of sexually oriented businesses, I was deeply concerned to learn that this particular loophole even existed in current Federal law, which essentially allows a child rapist to admit to sexually abusing a child and yet still evade punishment. The background is important to reiterate. As my chairman stated moments ago, this comes from a 2015 case, United States v. PalominoCoronado, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the conviction of a child sex offender simply because the court determined the perpetrator lacked specific intent to record the disgusting images that were found on the offender’s smartphone. This is despite the fact that the defendant admitted to sexually abusing the 7yearold child from next door and memorializing the conduct. In its opinion, the court decided the lack of purpose or specific intent was enough to overturn the conviction, even though the defendant himself took the photo of the heinous act and subsequently admitted to sexually abusing this child. This is absolutely in clear contradiction of our responsibility and this Congress’ intention to protect America’s children. In Scripture, Romans 13 refers to the governing authorities as ‘‘God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.’’ I, for one, believe we have a moral obligation, as any just government should, to defend the defenseless. My legislation presents a simple fix and updates title 18 of the U.S. Code to ensure future defendants are not able to circumvent the law by simply claiming a lack of intent, especially after knowingly creating a visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually conduct. More specifically, my legislation amends section 2251 of title 18 to prohibit the production and transmission of a visual depiction of a real minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Furthermore, it amends current law to include prohibiting the depiction of a minor assisting any person in engaging in a sexually explicit act. Lastly, to clarify potential circumstances of misinterpretation of the statute and to ensure the statute is not used erroneously to prosecute internet services providers when they have not engaged in wrongdoing, my legislation emphasizes that to be criminally liable under section (a)(3), an internet service provider must have actual knowledge that the child pornography is on its server and that it must intentionally transmit that image or intentionally cause its transmission. We also take the step of prohibiting any criminal or civil liability for internet service providers who are required to transmit child pornography to law enforcement in response to a legal process, such as a search warrant in child exploitation cases. Of course, we would never anticipate a prosecution of an internet service provider for merely responding to a legal process, but it is my hope that explicitly providing for this immunity in the statute will further enhance the relationship between internet service providers and law enforcement to work together to combat these predators. In answer to the opposition that we have heard here, it is important to reiterate this legislation does not create new mandatory minimums. However, I would like to address the comments regarding the current law on mandatory minimum penalties under the production of child pornography statute. There is simply no evidence that Federal prosecutors are abusing this statute. I think we should all recognize that producing child pornography is a horrific crime. It often means luring young children into acts that no one, man, woman, or child, should be forced to do. It is not a photograph of a nude child. It is something far worse. Each photo is a crime scene. Such a horrific act by the perpetrator requires the maximum amount of legal deterrents. While mandatory minimums have reached much scrutiny in the drug statutes, in this venue for this statute, there could be no doubt that the penalties that exist under current law are appropriate. Child sexual exploitation is vastly underreported. The number of images of child pornography keeps growing and the images are becoming more and more depraved. The harm is too great to these victims not to have significant penalties available to deter this conduct and punish the producers of child pornography. Every time an image of child pornography is viewed, the victim gets revictimized. Once an image is on the internet, it is irretrievable and can continue to circulate forever. This permanent record of a child’s sexual abuse can alter his or her life forever. Many victims of child pornography suffer from feelings of helplessness, fear, humiliation, and lack of control, given that their images are available for others to view in perpetuity. b1045 These images are becoming more sadistic and violent, and the age of the average victim is becoming younger and younger. It is a horrifying fact that it is not uncommon for even toddlers and infants to now be subjects of these images. It is also important that there is no confusion about one fact: The very creation of these images is repulsive, regardless of whether or not the abuse was done with a specific intent of creating an image or if the intent to memorialize this conduct was a secondary thought. Consider the facts of the case that led to this bill. As was mentioned, an adult male had sexual relations with a 7yearold girl who lived next door and decided to photograph it. That is the production of child pornography. There is no question about it. No one should be permitted to escape responsibility merely by asserting they did not have a specific intent to create the image before they abused the child. The act of taking a photo or making a video is enough to demonstrate intent. Mr. Speaker, that is what this bill does. It is appropriate that we are doing all this on the day that we recognize as National Missing Children’s 
Day. I am going to urge all my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the opponents and proponents of this legislation because they have said much the same thing. H.R. 1761 is a bill that stands against everything we stand against. It is for protecting against child exploitation, and we all agree with that. We agree, as well, that the bill has existing mandatory minimums and the attempt of the proponent of this bill to ensure that the decision that occurred in Palomino would not occur again. Some clarification has occurred, and that is that the bill, or the law, now, with H.R. 1761 explicitly prohibits the creation of a visual depiction or live transmission of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. That is, of course, a meritorious and unanimously supported position. The mandatory minimums continue and also are added to, now, a number of other offenses. As have been indicated, those offenses can be upwards of 20 years, and they can be for a variety of offenses added under this bill. So the bill is well intended, and the initial prohibition could draw support in a bipartisan manner, but the continued adding of offenses to mandatory minimums rather than language that would have left the sentencing to the discretion of the Federal court—which, by the way, many Federal judges have come to this Congress and to the Committee on the Judiciary to ask for and indicate the value of discretion as relates to their sentencing. This is not a death penalty case, so, clearly, the discretion of the court and the wisdom of the court could be utilized for the appropriate new offenses and the appropriate sentencing. So while the bill is well intended, it is overbroad in scope and will punish the very people it indicates it is designed to protect: our children. H.R. 1761 would expand and modify the meaning of sexual exploitation of children, thereby granting new offenses that may be prosecuted under section 2251 of the Federal criminal code, which generally prohibits the production of child pornography. As indicated, it works to fix the Fourth Circuit decision in Palomino, which reversed the defendant’s conviction because the decision was that there was no proof of intent. The structure of the statute, however, would significantly be modified by H.R. 1761, separating section 2251(a) into five enumerated offenses, codified as 2251(a)(1) through (5). Based on the language in this bill, to criminalize the knowing consent of the visual depiction or live transmission of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, a teenager sexting another teenager could be swept up under the statutory power of this new measure. Research shows that 91 percent of teenagers, tweens, have access to the internet and/or a smartphone. Hence, given the rampant advancement in technology and, consequently, its usage among this demographic, we must exercise prudence when introducing legislation that is seemingly ignorant of the growing trend of communication among teenagers. H.R. 1761 ignores the lifealtering impact it would have on our juveniles who engage in otherwise stupid and immature behaviors and, in most cases, consensually explicit sexual conduct if we begin to criminalize such conduct. While this bill seeks to protect minors—and I congratulate the proponent for that intent—in the same vein, it drastically alters the penalty for minors who may face mandatory minimums in sentencing, and, therefore, it is flawed in its design and intended purpose. Let me be very clear: Legislators have very good intentions, but we cannot stand on the floor and guarantee how it will be interpreted. We cannot guarantee that one teenager will not be caught up in this new legislation. Court interpretation, prosecutors’ interpretation, all that will be subjected to mandatory minimums, which is in the underlying bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POLIQUIN ). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to consider these concerns. I heard the gentleman speak of his effort to ensure that the internet provider would have to show intent or have intentionally engaged. Again, the interpretation of these bills are subject to interpretation, and the clearer we can be here on the floor of the House, the more we can be appropriate in its application. My point is, in concluding, I hope we will ultimately have legislation that comes back to the floor of the House that we all may be able to join in and that the elements that do not impact and protect our teenagers will be eliminated and we can be assured that internet providers are protected as well. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to just say a couple of important points in rebuttal to what we have heard. For one thing, there has been no evidence that the cases referenced by the gentlewoman involving conduct between minors are being prosecuted at the Federal level. I have not seen even one that has been cited. The point here is that prosecutorial discretion has been a sufficient buffer. In committee, our colleagues on the other side have invoked stories of juvenile offenders being charged for consensual conduct and placed on sex offender registries unjustly; however, these are all cases that were prosecuted at the local level. Not one that has been mentioned has been a Federal case. It is important to note that, for offenders under 18, the Federal Department of Justice policy on charging juveniles means that juvenile prosecutions very rarely occur, and only if no State court can assume jurisdiction. In fact, certification from the Attorney General himself is necessary to proceed against a juvenile. Again, I know of no such case in which a juvenile has been prosecuted federally under any child pornography statute. So while we appreciate and understand the concerns about mandatory minimum sentencing and its abuse, particularly with the drug statutes, again, it is important to reiterate here, that is not the case with child pornography. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I would oppose these arguments and trust that my colleagues will see the wisdom in supporting this very important and timely legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the Members of the House cannot rely on prospective discretion to protect juveniles under this statute. We simply can’t rely on it, participate in, given the new policy of the Attorney General. We are under a new regime here at the Federal level, and I can’t depend on relying on the prosecutorial discretion to protect juveniles under this statute. Mr. Speaker, I believe this bill is well intended, and I share my colleagues’ desire to protect children from being victimized by their depiction in pornography. However, I also believe that we must address the serious problem presented by the bill, namely, that it would expand the application of the existing array of mandatory minimum sentences that the code provides for these offenses. This aspect of H.R. 1761 directly conflicts with the growing bipartisan realization that mandatory minimums are unjust and unwise; this is so even for egregious offenses for which judges should be allowed to impose sentences—often severe and even beyond the minimums—based on the facts and circumstances of each case. I want to leave it up to the judges. In considering legislation to better protect our children from the types of exploitation addressed by this bill, we must not ignore the sentencing implications of these revisions to the statute. In light of the bill’s failure to address these serious concerns, I oppose H.R. 1761 and urge my colleagues to do likewise. We should consider even stronger legislation that addresses all these concerns. We are not through with the subject matter by this bill coming before us today. There is more work to be done. I thank my colleagues for this very important discussion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, the concerns stated today are misplaced. The child pornography statutes have never been the subject of abuse by Federal prosecutors, and there is no evidence that that would happen in the future. However, the abuse that is being allowed and that we must address today is that of our children, and that abuse is being allowed because of a loophole that was, sadly, created by a Federal court. Today we have an opportunity to correct that wrong. We have an opportunity to do what we all acknowledge to be the right thing: to defend the most defenseless among us. It is, indeed, an honor for us to take this action on the week that commemorates National Missing Children’s Week and here, even, on this day, National Missing Children’s Day. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act. We hope that everyone will do the right thing here today. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. FOXX). All time for debate on the bill has expired. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MS . JACKSON  
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 115– 152. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 5, line 3, insert after ‘‘section 2258B.’’ the following: ‘‘(h) Notwithstanding subsection (e), a person who violates paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (a) and is 19 years of age or younger at the time the violation occurred may, in the alternative, be punished for a violation of this section by imprisonment for not more than 1 year or a fine under this title, or both, if— ‘‘(1) the minor is 15 years of age or older and not more than 4 years younger than the person who committed the violation, at the time the sexually explicit conduct occurred; and ‘‘(2) the sexually explicit conduct that occurred was consensual.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 352, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. b1100 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I associate myself with the words of the ranking member, Mr. CONYERS . I look forward to strengthening these laws and, as well, working on legislation to continue to protect our children, our innocent children, from sexual abuse, sexual assault, and the devastation that it has on their lives. So I rise to continue that theme and to indicate, as I said earlier, that some of the clarifications in the underlying bill are important, and important to clarify, and important to provide prohibitions that will be clear in possible further court interpretations. But I maintain that we cannot predict the court interpretations, and the better and clearer that we are to protect our children, I believe, is a route that we should take. The bill would add new classes of offenses. But section 2251 does not provide for Romeo and Juliet exceptions; i.e., the penalties apply even when conduct is consensual and when the victim and offender are close in age. For example, a 19yearold and a 17yearold who videotaped themselves engaged in a sexual act, then emailed the video to their own email accounts, the 19year old would be subject to mandatory minimums. That is the basis of the amendment, the Jackson Lee amendment. The Jackson Lee amendment is a Romeo and Juliet exception. The amendment is a reasonable approach to treatment of adolescent behavior that should not be left to prosecutors. The pervasiveness of personal technology, such as cell phones and tablets, have given rise to teenage sexting. Research has shown that teenage sexting is widespread, even among middle schoolage youth. Under section 2251, teenagers prosecuted for talking and sending messages, and then taking and sending messages, would be subject to mandatory prison sentences of at least 15 years and sex offender registration. In light of the recent troubling statements by Attorney General Sessions, Congress should provide an alternative to existing mandatory penalties in sexting cases, particularly with juveniles. We cannot say that a juvenile will not be prosecuted federally. They could be, under this particular statute. So this is a carveout, a Romeo and Juliet carveout, to ensure that it does not happen, to protect against the possibility of it happening. A study conducted by Drexel University found that more than half of the undergraduate students who took part in an online survey said they had sexted when they were teenagers, and 30 percent said that they included photos in that message, meaning that they had sent sexual texts. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues come together and support the Jackson Lee amendment for a Romeo and Juliet carveout. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, it is not only unnecessary, but it is fashioned in such a manner which may potentially create the type of loophole that we are looking to close. Under current law, socalled Romeo and Juliet cases, such as those between 19 and 50yearolds, could be prosecuted under any of the child pornography laws—possession, production, or distribution. That has always been the case. However, I reiterate that we know of no such instance that has been brought under any of these Federal provisions under the circumstances covered by this amendment, which further supports the fact that Federal prosecutors do not appear to be bringing such cases. There is just simply no evidence that has been produced to suggest otherwise. For that reason, the amendment is completely unnecessary, and it is based upon no evidence at all. On the contrary, the underlying bill is based upon a real case where a real 7yearold girl was sexually abused and photographed by a real sexual predator. Our colleagues on the other side have also continually referred to Attorney General Sessions’ recent charging memoranda which suggests that under the policy in his memo prosecutors will suddenly be forced to aggressively prosecute 19yearolds who are engaging in consensual sexual conduct under this statute. But that notion is preposterous and is also based on no evidence. As an initial matter, the minority completely ignores the fact that a prosecutor makes an initial determination as to whether to commence or decline prosecution. And this is distinct from the subsequent decision of what charges should be brought, which would only occur if the decision to prosecute is made in the first place. According to the U.S. attorneys’ manual, in making the initial determination to commence a prosecution, a prosecutor must consider whether ‘‘a substantial Federal interest would be served by the prosecution,’’ and whether, ‘‘in his or her judgment: One, the person is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or, two, there exists an adequate noncriminal alternative to prosecution.’’ The Sessions memo doesn’t change any of that, and it is absurd to think that the memo will cause the Department of Justice to suddenly shift its prosecutions to aggressively go after Romeo and Juliet cases. This is especially ridiculous, as Attorney General Sessions had made clear from the outset, that the priorities of DOJ and this administration are to prosecute violent crimes and violent offenders. I think that the minority just fundamentally misunderstands and mischaracterizes not only the Sessions memo but this legislation. For that reason, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the Jackson Lee amendment. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, let me quickly say that I respect the 
gentleman, but I take great issue in calling a Member’s amendment, or the analysis of that amendment, ridiculous, because it is not ridiculous. It is an extremely reasonable amendment. And unless he has some powers that I am not aware of, no one can predict when a prosecutor will determine that they will prosecute. We cannot. We pass criminal justice laws every day and cannot predict. Whether or not it is based upon the Sessions memo, which as far as anyone who can read knows that we are going back to a stricter enforcement of everything criminal against everyone. That is clear. The Jackson Lee amendment recognizes that not all sex offenses are the same. And currently, section 2251 is a onesizefitsall sentencing scheme. It fits all, even a 19yearold. The Jackson Lee amendment would provide a better alternative. Punishment will be available involving offenses. When defendants are no more than 19 years old, they would have other alternatives. The judge would have discretion. That is simply what we are asking for. Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD an article entitled, ‘‘Keep Mandatory Minimums Out of the Juvenile Justice System.’’ This bill does not do that; and I also include an article entitled, ‘‘Teenage Sexting is Not Child Porn.’’ 
THEJUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM  (By Lizzie Buchen) Across the country, mandatory minimum sentences are falling out of favor. From Sen. Rand Paul to Attorney General Eric Holder, people from both ends of the political spectrum are blaming these harsh and punitive sentences for driving our skyrocketing incarceration rates and exacerbating racial disparities in the criminal justice system. But in this era of smart sentencing reform—particularly toward young people—a disturbing piece of legislation is coasting through the California legislature, threatening to wrench the state in the opposite direction. Senate Bill 838, authored by state Sen. Jim Beall (D– Santa Clara), would break new ground by establishing the first mandatory minimum sentences in the state’s juvenile justice system. The juvenile justice system was founded on the understanding that young people who commit offenses are often struggling in situations outside of their control, are highly amenable to rehabilitation and have the potential to lead productive and lawabiding lives. Mandatory minimum sentences automatic sentences of incarceration or confinement, meted out regardless of the facts of the case are completely at odds with these foundational principles. They are determined not by the youth’s past circumstances or potential life ahead, but by what he or she has done. The only result is punishment, a sharp contrast to the rehabilitative ideals of the juvenile justice system. Mandatory minimum sentences are completely incompatible with how juvenile court works. When a youth has committed an offense, juvenile court judges tailor sanctions to best meet a youth’s unique needs for rehabilitation by weighing a comprehensive set of factors, including the severity of the crime, the statement of the victims, and the circumstances of the youth’s life—including mental health issues and experience with abuse, homelessness and extreme poverty. The judge then chooses from a wide range of communitybased and residential options, allowing him or her to tailor the sanction to best treat the youth and protect the community. In line with this focus on rehabilitation, the sentences are indeterminate, with terms based on the youth’s progress. Proponents of mandatory minimum sentences, including supporters of California’s youth mandatory minimum bill, claim that these sentences deter crime. But the evidence tells us this is a dubious notion at best. Although this bill would introduce the first mandatory minimum sentences in California’s juvenile justice system, such sentences have been in place in the adult system for decades—and are widely recognized as failures. A large and growing body of research has found that mandatory minimum sentences have come at enormous social, financial and human costs, with little benefit to public safety. There is no evidence that these sentences have a significant deterrent effect. If anything, these harsh punishments are counterproductive, putting the public at risk by disrupting families, impoverishing communities of human capital, making it more difficult for people to return to law abiding society and diverting precious public resources away from social services and toward costly incarceration. [From the New York Times, Apr. 4, 2016] TEENAGE SEXTING ISNOTCHILD PORN (By Amy Adele Hasinoff) Teenagers who sext are in a precarious legal position. Though in most states teenagers who are close in age can legally have consensual sex, if they create and share sexually explicit images of themselves, they are technically producing, distributing or possessing child pornography. The laws that cover this situation, passed decades ago, were meant to apply to adults who exploited children and require those convicted under them to register as sex offenders. Though most prosecutors do not use these laws against consensual teenage sexters, some do. The University of New Hampshire’s Crimes Against Children Research Center estimates that 7 percent of people arrested on suspicion of child pornography production in 2009 were teenagers who shared images with peers consensually. Almost two dozen states, including New York, Illinois and Florida, have tried to solve the legal problems that surround sexting with new legislation, and others, like Colorado, are considering new sexting laws. These reforms typically give prosecutors the discretion to choose between childpornography felony charges or lesser penalties like misdemeanor charges or a mandatory educational program. These new laws may seem like a measured solution to the problem of charging teenage sexters with child pornography felonies. However, once they have the option of lesser penalties, prosecutors are more likely to press charges—not only against teenagers who distribute private images without permission, but also against those who sext consensually. Given the extensive research that shows that young people who are nonwhite, low income, gay or transgender are disproportionately prosecuted for many crimes, there is good reason to suspect that laws that criminalize teenage sexting are being unfairly applied as well. As legislators have tried to cope with the legal fallout, they have also opened up more types of images to scrutiny: While child pornography laws apply only to sexually explicit images, many new sexting laws criminalize all nude images of teenagers, including photos of topless teenage girls. A better solution would be to bring child pornography laws in line with statutory rape laws by exempting teenagers who are close in age and who consensually create, share or receive sexual images. Vermont tried to enact major reform to its child pornography laws in 2009, but abandoned the effort after a national backlash and settled instead on a new misdemeanor law. In February, New Mexico passed a limited version of child pornography reform, which shields teenagers who receive a sexual image from a peer from facing childpornography possession charges. Teenagers who create or share sexual images can still be convicted of child pornography production or distribution. Both existing child pornography laws and new sextingspecific laws criminalize a common behavior among teenagers. Studies have shown that roughly onethird of 16 and 17 yearolds share suggestive images on their cellphones. Among young adults, rates are above 50 percent. In the past, partners wrote love letters, sent suggestive Polaroids and had phone sex. Today, for better or worse, this kind of interpersonal sexual communication also occurs in a digital format. And it’s not just young people: An article in an AARP magazine describes sexting as ‘‘fun, easy and usually harmless.’’ Like any sexual act, consensual sexting is somewhat risky and requires trust, but it is not inherently harmful as long as partners respect each other’s privacy and are attentive to consent. Studies have found that around 3 percent of Americans report that someone has distributed private sexual images without their permission, and around 10 percent of sexters report negative consequences. The risk of distribution is significantly higher among those who were coerced into sexting. The victim of a sexual privacy violation can be traumatized and humiliated, and is often blamed for his or her victimization. Unfortunately, the criminalization of sexting worsens this problem because teenagers know that if they report the incident they may be punished at school and possibly charged with the same offense as the perpetrator. In most jurisdictions, distributing a sexual image of a teenager is illegal, regardless of whether one is consensually sending a nude selfie to a partner or maliciously distributing a private photo of another person without permission. Though some people believe that prohibiting sexting discourages the practice and protects teenagers from harm, research on abstinenceonly sex education demonstrates that those policies actually increase unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. Abstinenceonly messages about sexting are likely to be counterproductive as well. What parents and educators need to do instead is help young people learn how to navigate sexual risk and trust. Whether or not it is criminalized, we cannot prevent sexting, just as we cannot prevent teenagers from having sex. What we need to focus on is preventing acts of sexual violation, like the distribution of a private image without permission, pressuring a partner to sext or sending a sexual image to an unwilling recipient. Though not all teenagers are sexting, those who are (and those who will when they are older) need to learn how to practice safer sexting, which means that it always has to be consensual. As State Senator George Mun˜oz, a prominent supporter of the amendment that established New Mexico’s new sexting regime, told 
The Guardian, ‘‘Our laws have to change with technology.’’ To keep up with those changes, the first step is to decriminalize consensual sexting by creating exceptions in child pornography laws for teenagers who are close in age. Once we do this, we can concentrate on developing better ways to deal with the new digital forms of harm. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about my amendment to H.R. 1761, ‘‘Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act.’’ As Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, I offer this amendment to help make H.R. 1761 a better bill to achieve its intended purpose. Though troubled by any sexually explicit activity that may exploit and otherwise, harm our children, I believe that H.R. 1761, the ‘‘Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act,’’ is deadly and counterproductive to ensuring protection of our youth population in our new technology era. This bill will exacerbate overwhelming concerns with the unfair and unjust mandatory minimum sentencing that contributes to the overcriminalization of juveniles and mass incarceration generally. Simply put, this bill will add to the already tragic realities of many juveniles. Rather than proceeding with the caution befitting an expansion of the mandatory sentencing penalty, H.R. 1761 is being rushed to the House Floor, without a single hearing and without the opportunity to consider amendments directly relevant to whether our system of criminalizing juveniles for sexting is fair, just, and sound policy. Though presented as a proposal to protect children, H.R. 1761 excessively penalizes juveniles and creates life altering criminal charges when engaged in ‘sexting’. Rather, it raises new constitutional concerns; and it does not address documented and systemic unfairness and racial disparity in the imposition of mandatory sentencing and its overbroad sweep of criminalizing juveniles. My amendment fixes that problem. It creates an alternative punishment (not more than one year of imprisonment) under section 2251 for teenagers who participate in ‘‘sexting’’ and might otherwise be subject to mandatory minimum sentences of at least 15 years in prison. The Jackson Lee is a thoughtful, narrowly drawn provision that provides judges with a sensible sentencing option for teenagers no more than 19 years old who participate in sexting that may be applied in the judges’ discretion, in appropriate cases. The Jackson Lee amendment is a reasonable approach to treatment of adolescent behavior that should not be left to prosecutors. The pervasiveness of personal technology, such as cellphones and tablets, has given rise to teenage ‘‘sexting.’’ Research has shown that teenage sexting is widespread, even among middle schoolaged youth. Under section 2251, teenagers prosecuted for taking and sending such messages would be subject to mandatory prison sentences of at least 15 years and sex offender registration. In light of the recent troubling statements made by Attorney General Sessions, Congress should provide an alternative to existing mandatory minimum penalties in ‘‘sexting’’ cases. A study conducted by Drexel University found that more than half of the undergraduate students who took part in an online survey said that they sexted when they were teenagers. Thirty percent said they included photos in their messages and 61 percent did not know that sending nude photos via text could be considered child pornography. Another online survey published in 2008 found that almost 40 percent of teenagers between ages 13 and 19 had sent ‘‘sext’’ messages, almost 50 percent had received a sext message, and 20 percent posted nude or semi nude content online. The Jackson Lee amendment recognizes that not all sex offenses are the same. Currently, section 2251 employs a onesizefitsall sentencing scheme. Under section 2251, a 19 yearold, who engages in ‘‘sexting’’ (sending or receiving a sexually explicit photo or video of a minor) with a willing, 17 yearold girlfriend or boyfriend, would be subject to the same mandatory minimum sentence as a 50 year old man, who engages in the same conduct with a 17 yearold. The Jackson Lee amendment would provide a better alternative. The alternative punishment would be available in prosecutions involving offenses under section 2251(a)(2) or 2251(a)(3), when the defendant is no more than 19 years old, the difference in age between the defendant and victim is no more than four years, and the sexually explicit conduct depicted in the photo or video was consensual. Judges would not be required to sentence teenagers pursuant to the alternative punishment. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ). Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and congratulate her on this very important amendment. This amendment creates alternative sentencing specifically for teenagers who participate in sexting and could, as a result of this bill and the application of current mandatory minimum sentences, be subject to mandatory sentences of at least 15 years. We should not, as she has already stated so well, leave it to prosecutors to determine whether teenagers take part in teenage behavior. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I have tremendous respect for my colleagues on the other side, Mr. CONYERS and Ms. J ACKSON LEE. I understand her amendment is heartfelt and has the proper motive and attention. I would just suggest, again, that the risk of this amendment outweighs any potential benefit because it creates the kind of loopholes that we are trying here desperately to prevent. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on adoption of the amendment will be followed by 5 minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and passage of H.R. 1973.

RECOGNIZING BRIAN C. COOPER ON HIS RETIREMENT Mr. WOMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Brian C. Cooper, who is retiring from the Office of the Parliamentarian after 35 years on Capitol Hill. Brian is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and a graduate of Frederick Douglass High School and the Community College of Baltimore County, where he received his degree in commercial and graphic arts. Brian began his Capitol Hill career in September of 1992, when he was hired in the stockroom of the Longworth Building, working in publication and distribution services. Throughout the eighties and early nineties, Brian held a variety of positions on Capitol Hill, including roles on the Small Business Committee and the Government Operations Subcommittee. Through this experience, Brian learned the intricacies of the legislative process and the innerworkings of House operations, skills that would serve him well when, in 1995, he was hired as an Assistant Clerk to the Parliamentarian. Brian would spend the next 22 years in the House Parliamentarian’s Office and became Chief Clerk to the Parliamentarian in 2009. For over two decades, Brian has been a fixture at the House rostrum, dutifully assisting the presiding officer in timekeeping, recognizing Members on the floor, and preparing and reviewing reams of legislative paperwork for the House. Brian has prepared the House Chambers for both visiting dignitaries and State of the Union addresses alike, and everything in between. If that wasn’t enough, Brian also created the first computer network for the Parliamentarian. An accomplished artist, Brian remains active in artistic endeavors, which run the gamut from pencil drawings, watercolors, and oils, to photography and architectural design. His retirement will offer new opportunities to continue these pursuits. A devoted Orioles fan, it is my hope that Brian will spend some of his wellearned free time at Camden Yards. A consummate professional, Brian has spent his career on Capitol Hill committed to assisting with an orderly and accurate legislative process, observed in a fair and nonpartisan manner. He is a quintessential legislative resource for this entire body, and I am certain the House of Representatives has known few individuals more dedicated to its proper functioning and legacy than Brian Cooper. On behalf of everyone affiliated with this, the people’s House, including my colleagues gathered in front of me here as I speak, Brian, we are happy to celebrate this important milestone in your life, and we thank you for your dedicated service to the House and to America. 
MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, the President’s fiscal year 2018 budget calls for the elimination of the Minority Business Development Agency. This is shameful and counterproductive to the progress that minorityowned firms have achieved. I led on this issue by sending two bipartisan letters to the House Appropriations Committee, joined by over 70 Members, advocating for Congress to fund the MBDA at fiscal 2017 levels, and recommending that the MBDA provide annual policy reports to Congress. The agency has one of the highest returns on investment in the Federal Government, helping minorityowned firms secure $40 billion in contracts and capital over the last 10 years. The 8 million minority businesses in the United States contribute $1.4 trillion in economic output to the economy. My home State of California leads the Nation with 1.6 million minorityowned firms, which represents 45 percent of all businesses in my State. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue funding the Minority Business Development Agency so that we can continue to see this progress in our economic growth and for the communities of our Nation. 
NATIONAL MISSING CHILDREN’S DAY (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, today is National Missing Children’s Day. This day of recognition was started by President Reagan in 1983 to raise awareness of the threat of child abduction, and reminds us today that we still have work to do. Following the tragic murder of 9 yearold Amber Hagerman in 1996, Congress authorized the AMBER Alert system to create a coordinated alert system to assist law enforcement in finding abducted children in the important first hours after an abduction. Since its inception, more than 800 children have been recovered through the use of the AMBER Alert system. However, the original legislation did not include Indian Tribes as eligible users of the program, and we saw the tragic effects of this exclusion when 11 yearold Ashlynne Mike was abducted and murdered on the Navajo Nation. For this reason, I have introduced the AMBER Alert in Indian Country Act. This act will include our 567 Federally recognized tribes as partners in the AMBER Alert Program to ensure that everyone is able to utilize this important tool. My bill is a bipartisan effort and it is endorsed by criminal justice, child safety groups, and Indian Tribes around the country. Mr. Speaker, the AMBER Alert has helped many families experience the joy of being reunited with an abducted child. It is time we extend this alert to Indian Country so that no child is outside the jurisdiction of this vital program. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so we can continue to protect our children. f 
AMERICA NEEDS A RAISE (Mr. ELLISON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, America needs a raise. It has been years since we have increased the Federal minimum wage, which is an abysmal $7.25. All over this country, we see ballot measures passing in red States and blue State increasing the minimum wage, like Alaska and Arkansas. We have seen the minimum wage go up in New Jersey and all over the country. While people in Congress may not realize that America needs a raise, people across the United States do. Today I am going to participate in a press conference to say that we are going to propose a bill to raise the minimum to $15 an hour and index it. This is a simple recognition that if you work full time, you shouldn’t live in poverty. If you work full time, you shouldn’t have to rely on food stamps, you shouldn’t have to rely on housing assistance, and you shouldn’t have to rely on medical assistance. I believe in those programs and I support them, but if you work hard every day, you shouldn’t have to rely on government assistance just to put food on the table. Mr. Speaker, twothirds of the people who benefit from an increase in the minimum wage are women. This is a gender issue. This is a general inequality problem. We have to fight. America needs a raise, Mr. Speaker. Let’s do it. 
b1200 REMEMBERING DR. AMY REED (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that we say good bye to Dr. Amy Reed, a recognized physician, exemplary mother and wife, and dedicated patient advocate. Dr. Reed didn’t ask for the situation she found herself in following a procedure in 2013, but it was immediately evident to anyone that met her—and her family—that she was going to be a fighter, not only for herself but for others. 
Through her loving husband’s, Hooman’s, campaign to bring awareness to the dangers of power morcellators, there is no doubt that women’s lives around this country have been saved and device manufacturers and regulators have been forced to review their safety protocols and standards. This is Amy’s gift, and we are eternally grateful. My thoughts and prayers are with her dedicated husband and partner, their six children, and her entire family. Let our community embrace them in their time of sorrow and vow to carry Amy’s legacy and mission forward. 
THE PRESIDENT’S BUDGET (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today, Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions spoke in Memphis, Tennessee. I felt like I was listening to something out of the fifties or sixties. He put out all the platitudes about being tough on crime and locking people up and thinking that was going to help solve the crime problem. He didn’t talk at all about the cost of crime and the Bernie Madofflike budget that we have been presented by the Trump administration, cutting minority business centers, cutting SNAP funding, cutting LIHEAP funding, and cutting opportunities for Medicaid, healthcare, and education. There are causes to crime that should be attacked. There is a smart way to attack crime, and there is a dumb way to attack crime. The dumb way is to return to the era where we failed because we locked up so many people at $30,000 a year that the only people who are happy about his approach are the private prison industry who make money out of people’s misery and crime. 
MEMORIAL DAY (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to honor our country’s fallen servicemen and women. This weekend, we will observe Memorial Day, a day dedicated to those who have fought and died selflessly to protect our country. Since 1868, Americans have celebrated what was once called Decoration Day to honor the fallen. Every year since then, we have honored those who have fallen at Gettysburg, at San Juan Hill, in the Argonne Forest, on the shores of Normandy and Guadalcanal, at Inchon, at la Drang, in the desert at Objective Norfolk, on the streets of Fallujah, and in Zabul Province. This important day is not only meant to commemorate those who lost their lives fighting for our country but also to highlight why they were called upon to serve our country in battle. They fought to preserve the great privilege of freedom that we must never take for granted. America’s promise of liberty would not be possible without the courage and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform. We owe these patriots a debt that can never be repaid but that must be remembered always, not just on Memorial Day. This day of remembrance is a solemn occasion, and, therefore, let us not only say prayers for the fallen, let’s also celebrate their lives and give heartfelt thanks to God and their families for their sacrifices in protecting our Nation, the world’s bastion of liberty and freedom. f 
CHILD RESCUE COALITION (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I supported the Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act to help stop the unspeakable cruelty of child pornography. The trade of child pornography on the internet is not just information streaming across wires, it is abuse; and those who trade in child pornography are compounding the physical abuse of innocent victims who are depicted in these horrible images. They are real children next door and across the country. An astounding 28 percent of American youth will be sexually victimized at some point in their lives. Thankfully, the Child Rescue Coalition in Boca Raton, Florida, is already fighting back. They are using realtime data to help law enforcement track sexual predators from the darkest corners of the internet to their front door. Child Rescue Coalition has used their cutting edge technology as a critical partner with law enforcement and child advocates to help rescue over 2,000 lonely, afraid, and hurt children across the world. I thank my constituent, Carly Yoost, for the heroic work of the Child Rescue Coalition—shielding, rescuing, and safeguarding children from sexual exploitation. 
THE FIGHT TO STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to continue support for this week’s focus on combating human trafficking. Some of the people most vulnerable to trafficking are unaccompanied alien children who cross our southern border. These children are oftentimes released to sponsors or relatives, and sometimes they simply disappear. Once released, unaccompanied alien children receive one followup phone call, and many are never contacted, leaving them potentially vulnerable to trafficking. No child should fall into the hands of traffickers because of our lack of surveillance. When I was in practice as a physician, if I ever suspected that a child had been abused, I was required by law to notify authorities. We should require no less of our Federal agencies. Today, I am asking the Office of Refugee Resettlement to redouble their efforts to make certain these children never end up in the care of the wrong people. I also want to take this opportunity to thank our Denton County sheriff, Tracy Murphree. Just last weekend, they conducted a significant human trafficking operation that led to 11 arrests. I am grateful for them and for all law enforcement officials for taking the steps to end this abuse. f 
NOW IS THE TIME FOR AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to go home and join my community in honoring the fallen as we come together and say thank you. But as I go home, as well, I will be visiting with so many constituents who will be asking the question: Why? This week in the Budget Committee, a very callous statement by the OMB Director about diabetes victims or individuals who have that disease who are sitting on their couch and eating nonnutritious food, because the budget that the President has offered wants to take 23 million people off of healthcare, take $880 billion away from seniors who are in nursing homes who need Medicaid, and shutting down the Meals on Wheels. That is inhumane and cruel. At the same time, they will be asking me about the ridiculous, if you will, actions of the President firing the FBI Director because he was involved in the Russian investigation, asking the National Security Agency Director to block or to avoid talking about Russian collusion, and the National Intelligence Director asking him to cover up such things. I believe now it is time for an impeachment inquiry that goes along with the other investigations, along with the U.S. commission, along with the legislation on the special prosecutor because a special counsel can be fired. Our constituents are asking for the truth, and we need to give the truth. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR VETERANS (Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce the Mental Health Services for All Veterans Act. Last week, on May 18, just before noon, a man in his car did a Uturn in Times Square, New York, and mowed down 23 people, killing a young woman. This man is obviously mentally ill. This man is also a Navy veteran. He is not alone. Every day in America, roughly 22 veterans commit suicide. In fact, according to a study by the GAO, 60 percent of troops that have been discharged for misconduct in recent years suffered from a mental illness. It is simply too difficult for many veterans in this country to receive mental health counseling, and we need to make mental health counseling available for every single veteran in this country, regardless of whether they were in the National Guard, in the Reserves, or in Active Duty. It is obvious when someone loses a limb or is injured tragically in war to identify that their injury is service related. But for veterans who go home at night and are alone by themselves suffering with a mental illness, too many are suffering alone, and it is not easy to identify these problems—especially when they are in crisis—to show up at a counseling center or to show up at a VA and demonstrate that their injury, their mental illness, is service related. We need to change this in this country. We need to make mental health services available for every single veteran in this country, regardless of their status and regardless of their income, in every single circumstance. 
VA SCHEDULING (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the passage of the Veterans Administration Scheduling Accountability Act. All too often, I hear from veterans across the 22nd District of New York who have waited months, and some years, to have their claims addressed. In their service to our great Nation, our veterans sacrifice so much. They should never die waiting for care they deserve and need. That is why the House took important steps to reform the scheduling and appeals process while expanding access to the important resources that our veterans depend on. This bill will hold every VA accountable. We seek to correct a wrong that has hurt so many of our veterans. On behalf of the veterans in the 22nd District, I thank my colleague, Representative JACKIE WALORSKI , and my colleagues in the House, for putting our Nation’s heroes first and unanimously passing this important piece of legislation right before Memorial Day. 
NATIONAL ASTHMA AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, May is Asthma Awareness Month. As cochair of the House Asthma and Allergy Caucus, I would like to talk about what we can do for our constituents living with asthma. About 24 million Americans have asthma, and more than onequarter are children. Asthma costs our health system more than $56 billion every year, along with billions lost in lost productivity. In New York, where more than one and a half million live with asthma, we are all too familiar with these staggering costs which come on top of a heartbreaking human toll: about 3,600 Americans die every year because of asthma. I have asked appropriators to fund the CDC’s National Asthma Control Program which helps States monitor and treat asthma at $29 million. This program has brought down asthmarelated costs by billions and literally saves lives. Since the program’s inception, deaths from asthma episodes have fallen nearly onequarter. So this works. It is money well spent, and we can’t afford not to have it. In honor of Asthma Awareness Month, I implore my colleagues to support this program and bring Americans living with asthma muchneeded relief. 
UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST 45TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNIVERSITY WITHOUT WALLS (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 45th anniversary of the University of Massachusetts Amherst University Without Walls, one of the oldest and most highly regarded adult bachelor’s degree completion programs in the Nation. Founded in 1971, UWW provides nontraditional students with access to the resources of our best universities. It has developed into a national leader in adult education, having graduated nearly 4,300 students, including basketball legend, Julius Erving. One of the first programs in the Nation to offer an innovative blend of online and classroom learning, UWW provides an excellent education to students, including many veterans who are unable to complete a traditional college degree due to financial constraints, family obligations, or personal hardship. The key to success is the incredible team of UMass Amherst faculty and staff who have dedicated their lives to teaching and supporting adult students as they balance family, community, and academic responsibilities. I wish to personally thank all of the faculty, staff, and UWW students for their dedication to excellence. f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BUDGET (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to President Trump’s proposed budget. This budget proposal confirms our worst fears about the priorities of his administration. The budget is cruel, it is shortsighted, and would be a disaster for efforts to strengthen the middle class in my district and across this country. It will hurt hardworking families and communities throughout New Hampshire. It guts public education, afterschool programs, and student loan support. It jeopardizes clean air, clean water, and our response to the opioid epidemic that is reaching crisis proportions. It eliminates critical programs for the most vulnerable, like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program which keeps lowincome seniors and families warm in the cold winter months and SNAP which helps families feed their children, and decimates successful economic development programs like the Northern Border Regional Commission and community development block grants. The last thing we should be doing is eliminating effective programs that create jobs and boost our economic competitiveness. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose these misguided cuts. 
b1215 SEXUAL ASSAULT IN CALIFORNIA (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Nolan Bruder’s younger sister believed that she could trust her big brother. So when this 19yearold brother offered her marijuana ‘‘dabs’’ and the opportunity to get high, she accepted, trusting him. But with Nolan’s pushing, she became so stoned that she no longer recognized the man in front of her, that it was her older brother. Taking advantage of her drugged state, he sexually assaulted his own 16 yearold sister. This is repugnant, Mr. Speaker. On May 17, Nolan was sentenced for rape of an intoxicated person. The sentence? A mere 240 days in prison and 
then probation. Why? Because the judge decided that prison would severely impact Bruder. Well, Mr. Speaker, isn’t that the point? Even evidence showed the defendant had no remorse and was smug at the trial. I was a prosecutor and a judge in Texas for over 30 years. I met a lot of rape victims and learned that their lives were forever devastated by rapists. Mr. Speaker, sexual assault is never the fault of the victim, contrary to what Judge Follett thinks. Judge Follett got it wrong, Mr. Speaker. He got it wrong in this case. It is time for him to pack his toothbrush and leave the bench. And that is just the way it is. 
INTRODUCING THE UNITED STATESISRAEL AGRICULTURE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP ACT (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the United StatesIsrael Agriculture Strategic Partnership Act, H.R. 2659, a bipartisan bill that permanently authorizes the U.S.Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development program, otherwise known as BARD, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary. I thank my cointroducer, Congressman YOHO, as well as you, Mr. Speaker, for being a cosponsor, and many others in the Florida delegation. I could wax ecstatic and poetic about BARD, but let me just say this: the program works. It inspires healthy competition of good ideas. It is beneficial to both countries and provides a fantastic return on investment; over $440 million worth of benefits for the United States and $300 million of benefits for Israel. BARD is focused on urgent goals like increasing agricultural productivity, particularly in hot and dry climates. BARD is training the next generation of innovators through ag science workshops and postdoctoral fellowships. It funds programs in over 25 States, including our great State of Florida. It strengthens our relationship with our best ally in the Middle East: Israel. This is a forwardlooking, commonsense, bipartisan bill supported by experts and advocates on both sides of the aisle. 
MEMORIAL DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise on the heels of Memorial Day to discuss what we must learn from those we specifically remember on this and every Memorial Day going forward. All among us, every single person in this Chamber, every single person that visits here, we all have those days of the year where the history that is buried down deep inside of us is stirred up for whatever reason that may be. For some of us maybe it is that we lost a loved one right around Christmas and now we can’t get through the holidays without remembering that person each year and the ways in which that person touched our life. Maybe for others it was right around your birthday when you lost a loved one or somebody passed, and on each year on the celebration of your own life, you find yourself remembering the loss of that life, the loss of that friend. Maybe for you that history is buried down inside and gets stirred up because of a certain smell in the air that brings you back to a time and place in your life. It can be hearing a special song that had meaning and somehow connected that person to you. For others, maybe it is driving past a certain restaurant or an intersection or a park that really weighs heavily on your heart. I find those feelings each and every day as I look down at my wrist and I read these bracelets with the names of friends who left this world in the most honorable way that any person can: in defense of our Nation. Men like Army Ranger Medic Jonathan Peney. On his fourth tour in Afghanistan, he died on June 1, 2010, from wounds that he sustained while giving medical aid to another wounded Ranger. He was only 22 years old. When I speak to his mother, I know just how much she misses him. Or Army Sergeant Justin Allen. He was killed on July 18, 2010. I can remember the last thing that I said to him. I remember the mission vividly that we were on, and I remember the Rangers who spoke about him the next day on the flight line as we sent him home. I remember Bradley Rappuhn and Andrew Nicol and the compound that we were assaulting when they passed. You know, for me and many others across this Nation, the day that stands out above all for us is a day that is just a few days from now. It is Memorial Day, the day that America has specifically set aside to remember the men and women that relinquished their life while serving in the United States Armed Forces. And it rests as the day that is most heavy on our hearts. This day is so heavy on my heart that, to my shame, one year I asked my wife, Brianna, that she and our children, Magnum and Maverick, not accompany me to the cemetery that I was going to be speaking at that Memorial Day. I asked that she stay at home with our two little boys. I made that request because I didn’t want my little boys to have to see me in pain. And at that point in life, I just wasn’t strong enough. I wasn’t strong enough to tell them why their daddy had tears or was crying on that day. And today I try to be more courageous, and I try to tell my boys why I have tears on that and every Memorial Day. And whenever I hear the slow solemn hum of taps, whether it is on Memorial Day or Veterans Day or in the presence of some newly fallen comrade or playing on a TV in the background, I have to pause and wipe my eyes and regain my composure. Or when I hear that cold crack of a 21gun salute, I do find myself too numb to the sound of gunfire to be startled by it, but it still reverberates to my core as though I was struck by the shots myself. That is the pain that I feel. You know, those little boys of mine, they need to know that there were brave men and brave women who showed strength and courage and patriotism with every fiber of their being on their behalf so that they may live free. That they may live free. Think about that. They served never thinking about personal gain or personal sacrifice, but thinking about their personal contribution to our Nation. And as we find ourselves on the heels of Memorial Day, I believe every Member of this House, every Member of Congress, must reflect on every tear shed across this Nation, every empty seat at every dinner table, every name etched onto a piece of stone that is for a son or daughter of America who gave everything for the freedom and the life of others. We in this Chamber must think daily about all the men and women who have fought and died for this cause, this Nation that they loved more than their own breath. I think about those that I knew personally, those that I have heard about. I think about those who came long before me. And I ask myself every single day: Would they be proud of the work that we do in this Chamber, how we represent our Nation and the values that they fought for that they gave their life for? Would they want us as a member of their team? I used to tell folks that, to date, in our theaters of war, I have lost 67 close friends. That used to be true. But the reality is I no longer know how many friends I have lost. I have stopped counting. What I know is that we must live the way that they lived every day: without excuse, without regret. Full throttle, as one of my friends used to say. For some of them, their blood has stained my own uniform. Some of them I lost simply being on the same mission. And some were on other missions 
in other places around the world. And each year on Memorial Day and many other days, I think most often of one of my friends specifically, Ranger Sergeant First Class Lance Vogeler, who, after four tours in Iraq and eight tours in Afghanistan, made the ultimate sacrifice on October 1, 2010, while in battle just a few short days after my own injury. I know that he is deeply missed by me and all of his friends, and certainly by his wife and his two children that he left behind. You know, I can remember him telling me about them one night as we were in Afghanistan and he and I sat against a fence in the dark of night waiting for a helicopter to come and pick us up. I can remember him telling me about his family. I wasn’t there when he passed, but I am told that his last words were of his wife and of his children. I think often if he would be proud of the way that this place conducts itself. He is the definition of a hero. He is exactly what Memorial Day honors. And knowing him, I know that none of us here can measure up, but I want to know that we honor him and every other hero who is remembered officially in just a few days with our actions in here each and every day. We owe it to men like him to fight to make America the strongest version of itself that it could ever be. I want us to honor each of those close friends that I have lost in our theaters of war and every other who has traded their life for our freedom, for our America, with their own actions on each day. As we approach Memorial Day, I always remember well a lot of things about those friends. I remember their smiles. And I remember the jokes that we would play on each other. I can remember hiding somebody’s gear or adding a big rock into their pack without them knowing, just to weigh it down, make them sweat a little bit more. And I can remember where they were from. I can remember the time that we spent training together, shooting together, jumping out of aircraft together, roping from helicopters together, blowing things up together. I can remember their hobbies, and I can remember their plans for what they wanted to do whenever they returned home. I can remember the pictures that they themselves would carry in their breast pocket of the ones that they loved most, just like the one that I would carry of my wife, Brianna, and our one son that I had at that time. I can remember their lifesaving actions on the battlefield. I can remember their acts of valor, and I can remember the way that we each confidently put our lives in each other’s hands. b1230 I remember some who are no longer with us today who placed themselves in the line of fire to carry me from the battlefield that I not become a casualty of war. I can remember their loyalty and their determination and their grit, and, for some of them, I can remember their last breaths. I can remember saluting their casket with the most beautiful flag that I have ever seen draped gracefully across it, and I can remember seeing that flag folded and handed to those whose pictures they had been carrying. I can remember seeing the way that those family members would cling to that flag. As I remember these moments, I want to see, more than anything, that the way we, here in the House of Representatives, conduct ourselves honors the way those who gave the last beat of their heart conducted themselves on our behalf. If statues of those men and women surrounded our floor here, would they look onto each of us each day and would they swell with pride over our service, or would their hearts sink? Would they turn away and be ashamed? Would they look on and be proud? The goal of American heroes has always been country first, themselves second. They knew, those who gave on behalf of this place, that the establishment of this country, the maintenance of America, its safety, the protection of each and every citizen is not a product of chance. It is not a product of luck. It is not a product of indifference. So they stood between every American and evil with purpose and resolve regardless of what it was going to cost them. They knew the job was never easy, it was never safe, it was always dangerous, and it was almost always deadly. While they may have disagreed on how to conduct a mission, I know they never wished for the failure of their comrade or, for that matter, the failure of any American ever. They certainly never wished for the failure of the leaders of our Nation. My office is in the Rayburn House Office Building, and in one of our entrances is the name of each who has fallen in the war on terror listed year by year. All of those friends of mine are listed there. When I see them, I stop, and I think about them every single time. I wish that the name of every single American who has fallen well in defense of our Nation adorned each and every wall of this Chamber in here, as it does in my office building, that we would look on each time we speak on this floor and question ourselves as to whether our motives are as pure as their motives were. Every American child, every adult, every man and woman has the limitless opportunities to enjoy their life, to become whatever it is in the world they want to be, to achieve whatever they have the courage to attempt and the determination and the fortitude to spend themselves in fully to accomplish. That limitless opportunity each citizen has and each of us in here in the House is afforded has been paid for with the blood and the spirit of men and women who traded their own life to fulfill an oath to our great Nation. Their oath was the same that we as Members of Congress vow to fulfill: to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; to bear true faith and allegiance to the same; to take that obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, so help us God. And though we take that same oath, I know we do not always show the same commitment. Those heroes never thought about what was easy or popular to masses or what they would get out of their actions. It was not reelection on the line for them. It was their life on the line, and they gave it freely. As I think about Memorial Day, I wish we could, daily, see every heroic name across our walls here and recall the harrowing stories of the Second World War and the over 400,000 U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine, Coastguardsman, and each and every Merchant Marine who fought and died in Europe and in the Pacific and in Africa for the freedom of the entire world from being ruled by an evil and intolerant empire. They died in places named Ardennes Forest and Midway and Guadalcanal. I wish we thought about each vote we took and looked at the names of our over 36,000 servicemembers who would never return home from the frozen mud of Korea and think is that what they fought for at the Chosin Reservoir. I wish we could recount the names and the stories of the over 58,000 servicemembers who died in combat or while captured or who went through torture and starvation before giving their life or while missing as a part of the Vietnam war in places like Khe Sanh and Saigon. I wish we saw the names of the servicemembers who put their country first and themselves second while serving in the Dominican Republic or Iran or El Salvador or Beirut or Grenada or Panama or the Persian Gulf as we thought about what we will say when we are given the chance to speak on this floor and if our words would be worth even one second of their life. I wish we could think about the Delta operators or the Army Rangers or the Black Hawk pilots who gave it all in the dusty sands of Somalia, Medal of Honor recipients like Master Sergeant Gary Gordon and Sergeant First Class Randall Shughart, who volunteered to go into a situation that they knew would claim their life in order to save their fellow fighters. They were devoted to their duty, and their duty was to their brothers and to their country. Or those who fought and died in Bosnia and Kosovo and on the USS Cole, and all those who fought in places that we may never know because of threats to us that we never even knew existed, we need to ask if they would give the last beat of their heart for the way in which we legislate our country. 
Most personally for me, I would think deeply on the thousands of soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, coastguardsmen who defended this country with the last beat of their heart in a place like Iraq or Afghanistan or Syria, would they be proud. These were the men and women who I served alongside, men and women who served selflessly and repeatedly year after year, knowing full well the hazards of their profession. I couldn’t be more proud than to have the few moments that I did with the best and the most honorable that our Nation has ever produced, who sacrificed their whole self because it was best for the men and women to their left and to their right in battle, because it was best for the freedom and the liberty and the security of every person. I don’t know how to ever make the pain of their loss go away. I do know how to honor them. We do it with the way that we live each day going forward that they do not have the opportunity to live. They would want every American to cherish the gift of freedom that they have been given by God, which was defended by those angels whose names are now etched in row after row of plain white markers in Arlington National Cemetery. They would want us all to live exactly as they lived: with no regrets, loving this country more than we loved ourselves, fighting as hard as they fought, never quitting, never giving up. We owe it to them to do so, to not ask ourselves what we can take for ourselves, but to ask what we, ourselves, can give. I want my kids to grow up honoring these men and these women who have sacrificed. I want my young boys to know that they get to give me a hug or a smile, but there are men and women who are willing to risk never having one more of those from their own families, and I want them to live the way that those heroes lived. I want my children to know it is honorable to have the courage to mourn them, and I want them to have the resolve to not squander the opportunities which have been paid for with the selfless blood of every American warrior. I get grief in my heart when I think of all those who have gone in defense of our flag, but I also think about each of the great warriors that they were, and I smile because there can be no more honorable way to leave this world than in a pile of brass while fighting for the greatest nation ever to be established on the face of this Earth. We here need to think of the thousands who gave their lives selflessly, without expectation of anything in return, true selfless servants serving simply to do what was best for the United States of America. Some were infantrymen; some were mortarmen; some were engineers or tankers or something else. They were men and women who, through the ages, created the reputation and the legacy and the tradition that made me say: ‘‘That is what I want to be. That is how I want to serve. That is how I want to help.’’ Here, we must learn from those who we think about most on Memorial Day. We need to look at them and their names and their lives and their stories and their sacrifice and demand the same thing out of ourselves. They pushed through the cold. They pushed through the snow. They pushed without adequate supplies. They fought back tanks. They always pushed forward in the face of bombarding artillery. They pushed so hard that their weapon would overheat. They pushed through trench foot. They did it with fixed bayonets, which they used to defend their own foxholes and then used them to carve our enemy out of their foxholes. They stayed in the fight when they were wounded, even though it would certainly mean a bitter end that was very far from home. They did not stop because they were tired. They did not stop because they were exhausted or freezing or hungry. They did it even though they had to sleep on the ground or sleep in the field or sometimes never sleep at all. They only stopped when the job was done. They only stopped when the mission was accomplished. This is the grit with which Americans have always defended America. We have taken that same oath in this House, and American heroes, they set the precedent for every generation about how to do that job. To do it for them was not just a job or a paycheck, it was a calling. It was a calling that few have the stomach to undertake and that, certainly, even fewer still are capable of ever doing. It requires uncommon characteristics such as courage and valor and selflessness. Today those words are thrown around very lightly by many, but those we remember on Memorial Day have actually lived and breathed the definition of these characteristics. They did it by flying aircraft or driving armored vehicles. They did it by setting sail with the most powerful fleet ever seen on our seas. They did it by yoking their bodies with a rifle or a pistol, by carrying hundreds of rounds of ammunition and hundreds of pounds of gear, wearing a helmet and explosives, carrying everything that they required to save the life of another servicemember as well as everything that they needed to survive for days or months on end. They did it while being targeted by snipers, while having bombs or mortars or grenades hurled at them, while having an RPG fired at them. They did it while walking in fields of mines and improvised explosive devices. They did it by carrying that load for miles and days across mountains, across rolling hills, and through fields and forests and rivers. They did it while carrying letters for their friends, which they promised to deliver to their family should anything ever happen to them. They did it while missing births and birthdays and ball games and bath times and holidays and every other good time that they missed with their families. They did it in the face of mortal combat. They did it while holding both the lives of their friends and the lives of our enemies in their hands. We honor those we remember who are not with us today by taking no charge more seriously than honoring their sacrifice with the lives that we now live. What those heroes have done in defense of our Nation can never be taken away from them. We must remember that so, too, what we do here in defense cannot be taken away by the years that pass if we endeavor to be warriors, willing to defend America at any and all costs. Those we remember are a testament to the importance of the values and ideals sewn into the fabric of our Nation, the absolutes. And all I can say is: Thank God for men and women like that, for creating such patriots for us to revere as the standard by which all other Americans should serve America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
b1245 ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GALLAGHER ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ), my friend. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, as a Floridian, I have to take a moment to share my gratitude to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) for the remarks he just shared. During my occupancy of the rostrum, my own eyes welled with tears as I thought of the empty chairs at the table in my own district and all throughout the country as people, as families have made sacrifice and sent those to fight for us. I can only be reminded, hearing the gentleman from Florida’s remarks, that each and every day in this House we do fall short of that great patriotism that is reflected by our servicemen and women: We could do better; we could be more worthy of the sacrifice; we could resist the influences of special interests more; we could make the tough decisions that are necessary; we could put America on a better footing forward. It is my belief and my sincere hope, by hearing the words of my colleague, by raising our gaze to an even broader and more accepting patriotism, that we can do it. And I believe Mr. MASTwill be one of the people that lead us in that regard. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for those remarks. Mr. GAETZ represents the First District of Florida, a brother in arms, 
since I represent the First District of Texas. We are very grateful for BRIAN MAST and what he has given for his country, what he has been willing to give for his country; and it is an honor to serve with him in the trenches—sometimes literal trenches around here—a great, honorable patriot for America. On Monday, that is what we will celebrate, Memorial Day, and I want to talk further about that. Right now I want to touch on an issue that has occupied a lot of people’s concern and time this week over CBO scoring, rather important, but it should not be. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Commission do the scoring. Historically, the projections by CBO seem all too often to be far too out of line that any governmental entity would base important critical decisions over people’s lives, their healthcare—it will certainly affect their lives—and base it on a group that, as they have explained: We set up models. And we feed the garbage—they don’t use that term. But, as far as I am concerned, they feed garbage in and they get garbage out. And projections: Oh, we have to wait and see what CBO says. People waiting with bated breath: Oh, is it going to be in line? For heaven’s sake, anybody that waits on a score for the JTC or the CBO in dealing with the tax reform that we should do doesn’t have much sense. And there is nothing wrong with not having much sense. It just hurts the country when people without much sense are here in Washington making decisions about people’s lives and encroaching on their liberty and freedom. So we have people like BRIAN MAST, and we have those who have given all, the last measure of devotion, for our liberty. Then we turn around and have a Federal Government that passes laws about healthcare reform and decides that they have to have all of the medical records here in the Federal Government. And do you know what? We need to have a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau to protect people from unscrupulous bankers, so we are going to get everybody’s banking records. Well, as a former judge and as a former prosecutor, if you wanted somebody’s banking records, you had to have sworn proof rising to the level of probable cause that a crime was committed and this person committed it, and then you got the records when a judge signed off on it. Not now. Not with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They just get everybody’s records. And then, without reining in ObamaCare and if we did not rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Washington continues to gather people’s medical records through sweetheart deals with private entities, a hypothetical I raised many years ago as ObamaCare was being pushed through, came ever closer—really, is here—to the point that we could reach a day—it is not quite here. We have still got a chance to save America from the Orwellian nature of ObamaCare and the CFPB combined. But years ago I said, you know, if we don’t stop this craziness, we are going to reach a point where you could get a letter from the Federal Government, saying: Hey, we have got your medical records, but we notice that you made a purchase at the grocery store this last week and bought some bacon, a pound of bacon. We know, from having your medical records, that your cholesterol, weight is not at a very healthy point right now, so you are either going to have to quit eating bacon or we are going to be penalizing you substantially, since we are in charge of your healthcare, your health insurance. We are in charge of it. That is where we have been heading. And it is something the Founders, who would not have seen the advent of the computers and the IT age, but what they did foresee, whatever developments in technology that came along, they foresaw this ongoing battle to keep government from controlling people’s lives and eliminating their liberty. That is what they saw coming. They didn’t have to see the technology. They knew what was coming if we didn’t keep the Federal Government reined in. I know there are groups out there that are gathering information that say: Well, this Member of Congress, this Senator, he doesn’t get many bills passed. Well, if you look at most of the things we have passed, other than funding bills, so often they are creating more government agencies and more government power. Each time we do, no matter how noble the purpose is, we are taking just a little bit of freedom and a little bit of liberty away from individuals and giving more power to the government. Why I think it is appropriate to bring this up as we approach Memorial Day is people have not fought throughout our history—going back to 1775, 1776, on to 1783 and the winning of the American Revolution, on through each of the wars that has been fought in the name of liberty—they didn’t fight so that we could come to the floor and pass more and more bills and create more and more government. Even when we are told, ‘‘Oh, but CBO says this will only cost $5 million this year, or only cost $5 million, so it is not that big a deal,’’ it is still eroding people’s liberty. It is still taking away freedom and giving more control to the government. So, as we look briefly at some of the history on CBO scoring, this is an article by Paul Teller, Special Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs. He says: 
A new report from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation calculated average monthly premiums for health insurance in the 39 States that use healthcare.gov. The research found that from 2013 to 2017 the average ObamaCare premium increased by 105 percent across the country. The report also looked at the cost spikes by State. While we await further analysis of the CBO score for the American Health Care Act as passed by the House, this information is an important reminder about the negative impact of ObamaCare. Besides just how unaffordable ObamaCare has been for hardworking Americans, you might consider three key things about today’s CBO score in the context of this new report. Number one, the original CBO estimate of ObamaCare premiums, November 30, 2009, said that premiums for the ‘‘nongroup’’ exchange markets would increase slightly and ‘‘would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016.’’ CBO has the gall to act like they are so important and so accurate, but over and over, if you look at critical projections they have made and for people to have said, and CBO, in 2009, you know, by 2016, you might have a 10 to 13 percent increase in your premiums is, or would be, laughable except for the crying of Americans across the country who can’t afford the premiums that have gone up 2, 3, 4, or 10 times. One of our smallbusiness employers said he paid, a couple of years ago, $53,000 for his employees’ health insurance, and the following year it was $150,000 for his employees. That leaves him without personal income because he had such a dramatic increase in the premiums. But how could that be? CBO said maybe a 10 to 13 percent increase over that 7year period. It comes back to show, once again, as I told Bloomberg this morning, it appears those folks, figuratively speaking, couldn’t find their rear end with both hands. 
Number two, even if you assume CBO’s AHCA estimate is completely accurate, the first score, March 17, 2017, showed that the bill would bring down nongroup premium costs over the next 10 years. While CBO did say that premiums would rise slightly over the transition period, attributed to the repeal of the individual mandate, by 2020 the AHCA would change the trajectory of premiums and ‘‘By 2026, average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market under the legislation would be roughly 10 percent lower.’’ 
b1300 So you hang around and wait for 10 years under the original AHCA and you might have a 10 percent decrease 10 years from now, which is absurd. They were so desperately wrong on their projections. And I don’t have it in front of me. It may be in one of these articles here, but I think originally their projection of cost of ObamaCare was about 1.1, $1.2 trillion over 10 years; and then, of course, the President got upset, because he had said: Oh no, it is going to be under $1 trillion for 10 years. He calls the Director of CBO over to the Oval Office. They have a conversation and, amazingly, the Director of CBO comes out and says: You know what? After meeting with the President, while I—things came clearer for 
me, and turns out it probably will be $800 billion or so. It will be like the President said. I just needed to speak to the President to all of a sudden have a lot more clarity than I did before I went to the Oval Office. But it is under $1 trillion, like the President said, now that I think about it with more clarity. And then, of course, after ObamaCare passed, very quickly we started learning, no, it wasn’t going to be under a trillion; it was going to be over a trillion; maybe 1.7, 1.9. And before long, we start seeing projections more like $2.6 trillion over 10 years. And even one that I had seen that said, you know, maybe 3.6, roughly $4 trillion over 10 years. As I have said a number of times, you know, any scoring agency whose margin of error is plus or minus 400 percent really shouldn’t be relied on by anyone trying to create meaningful law in Congress. That is why for a number of years I have been pushing for the elimination of CBO for a better system, where, as Americans, we believe in competition—or we used to. Now, I know we have got some folks that can’t compete. They need a safe space if somebody is going to compete with them. But what made America great was American competitiveness. We could compete with anybody and prevail. So why wouldn’t we have scorers compete so that we could score the scorers, so that every critically important bill to the American public didn’t get sidetracked by some bogus models? And I am not saying they do it intentionally. You don’t have to do it intentionally to have a margin of error plus or minus 400 percent. You can be legitimately that bad at projecting what things will cost; and it has happened throughout the time that we have had projections. So what I was proposing—and I got my friend, who was the chairman of the Budget Committee, to agree to sit down to dinner with a dear friend of his, Dr. Arthur Laffer, former economic adviser to Reagan, now an adviser to President Trump, and also a friend of both of ours, Steve Moore, who had been the senior editor with The Wall Street Journal. I asked if the Budget Committee chairman would sit down with me and Arthur Laffer and Steve Moore and talk about CBO. This has been a number of years ago. We sat down at the Capitol Hill Club one evening and, of course, my friend, Dr. Tom Coburn, walks by and says: Okay. Is this one of those puzzles? Figure out which piece doesn’t belong here? I get chairman of the Budget Committee, I get Wall Street Journal guy, Steve Moore, I get economic adviser Art Laffer. Louie, what are you doing at this table? But it was my idea. We needed to come up with a way to have competitive scoring by competitive scorers, and then get to where we can score the scorers, so that when we look at a score that is presented to us on a bill that is being proposed, you can look at the score of that scoring entity. And if they have a score, say, of 10 percent, being right within 5 percent, plus or minus margin of error, then we can probably take very seriously their scoring in the future. My friend—at that time he was Chairman RYAN—was very open to discussing it, but really kind of felt like we needed to keep CBO and have an official government scorer. But since then, Dr. Laffer called sometime later to let me know that he had received a private grant, and that he, his firm, and his son would be working on a model that could work for Congress, the House and Senate, to begin having competitive scoring and scoring the scorers so we could have something more reliable, so that we didn’t have a bunch of bureaucratic melees from models created that kept us from doing what was good for America. So, as I think has been pointed out before, whether you ask CBO, ‘‘How much Federal revenue would we have come in if we had 100 percent income tax or 200 percent income tax,’’ or if you said, ‘‘Tell us how much Federal revenue comes in if we create a 200 percent income tax,’’ since they are not allowed to consider reality and history, but only the models they create mechanically, it’s probably a good chance that they would probably dutifully come in and say: You know what? If you set up a 200 percent income tax in the United States of America, then next year you will bring in twice as much money to the Federal Treasury as all Americans make in that year. Because they are divorced from reality, it doesn’t work into their models they create. In talking to my friend, I hope he doesn’t mind my sharing it. I hope he will invite me to have spaghetti with his family at his home in Nashville again sometime. I love visiting with him there, being with his great family. But he was very encouraging. I was a little depressed. He said: You are a big idea guy. Don’t get discouraged when you propose big ideas like the CBO, getting rid of them, having competitive scoring, or having a— See, we get beat up every time we say: You know what? Like DANWEBSTER had found, we have 82 Federal programs charged with getting people to and from appointments, and we don’t need 82 Federal agencies. Most of them have white, 20seat vans, carry three people when they ever carry anybody. But if we try to eliminate one of the 82, well, you Republicans hate seniors or children or puppies or whatever it is. You are evil. So we keep 82 Federal programs to get people to and from agencies; whereas, if we could create— maybe it is a standing committee and we pull people from different committees—a public assistance committee where we have all 82 of those in every area of public assistance, we see all the duplication because it is all in the same committee, then we can start getting some kind of reasonable Federal Government back under control. Another idea that we just need to move on. But I have been joined by my friend, and I would be glad to yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ). 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Texas for yielding to me. I just want to take a few moments to thank the House for the work they did recently on H.R. 1242, and I want to urge the Senate to take action on this bill as well. So I rise today in support of H.R. 1242, entitled 400 Years of African American History Commission Act. I am a cosponsor of this legislation. I worked with my colleagues to pass this act in the House, and I look forward to the Senate also passing this bill. I believe it is important for all citizens of the United States to recognize the unique history, sacrifices, and remarkable contributions that African Americans have made to build our great Nation. I am invigorated by this legislative intention to identify and educate the public on the arrival of Africans and their role in building this great country. It is equally important to understand the generational impact that slavery and laws that enforced racial discrimination have had on our United States. While there have been many successful and inspirational African Americans with enumerable contributions, we must address ongoing disparities in employment and education by focusing on achieving six milestones for success. These milestones include: entering school ready to learn; reading at grade level by third grade; graduating from high school ready for college or career; completing postsecondary education or training; successfully entering the workforce; reducing violence and providing a second chance for returning citizens. I applaud the many organizations actively working to address these opportunity gaps faced by African Americans. In my community of the Second Congressional District of Nebraska, I appreciate the efforts of Willie Hamilton, president and founder of Black Men United. He is a true grassroots leader. In addition, I want to highlight some other organizations and work that is ongoing in the district I serve to implement a coherent cradletocollegeand career strategy for improving the life outcomes of all young people. These organizations include: the Urban League of Nebraska; the START Center, that is run by my friend, Julian Young; the Omaha Empowerment Network, coordinated by Willie Barney; the Eastern Nebraska Community Action Partnership; the 100 Black Men of Omaha; the Malcolm X Foundation; the Operation 
Youth Success; members of the Midlands Mentoring Partnership; the efforts of the City of Omaha through the Black Male Achievement Program, previously coordinated by Cameron Gales, another friend of mine. Like all complicated issues facing Americans, we need this type of strong community support, along with smart bipartisan legislation to address these problems. As the AfricanAmerican History Commission develops programs, I hope they will consider inspiring communities to continue building partnerships between local organizations, government, businesses, and foundations. This will connect young AfricanAmerican men and women with support networks, mentoring programs, and the skills and training they need to succeed in the classroom and in the workforce. While we learn from and celebrate the past, we must also look to a much brighter future for all Americans. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those important observations. I would like to point out something that is not getting enough attention, as the media seems to be driven over issues like charge of misdemeanor assault on a reporter, or a Russian connection, these kind of things. This story by Luke Rosiak, May 22, ‘‘Democratic Aide Suspected of Major Security Breach Under Government Protection in Pakistan.’’ There are some really critical issues here. These Pakistani individuals—we don’t know if they have fled now from the U.S., some gone back to Pakistan, but they have been working for our Democratic colleagues in the House—some of them—like my friend DEBBIE  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ , been working for her since 2005; may have worked for the DNC. Now, there are allegations of stealing, perhaps a couple of hundred thousand dollars or more of computer equipment from people here at the Hill; accessing the government information they should not have been allowed to access. They were banned from accessing the House system. One of them, particularly the one that has been working for Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ , apparently, according to the story, had stolen or taken a laptop of hers, hidden it, and a Capitol policeman found it. It is kind of important to us, even though the DNC never let the FBI, CIA, NSA, or any Federal agents examine the DNC computer system before they said: Oh, yeah, it is definitely the Russians. Really? How can you say it is definitely the Russians? You didn’t even examine it. But that is the way things have been going lately. But this is regarding Congressional computer systems, and we need to get to the bottom of how badly our system has been compromised. In addition to the thefts and, you know, making over $4 million since 2010, having people they owed money to—at least one—put on the system, now we learn he may have never visited the Hill, and still gotten over $200,000. Just a lot of issues need to be dried up, cleared up, but those are major issues that need to be clarified. No evidence of Russian collusion, but there is definitely evidence of Pakistani collusion and corruption through the fine Democratic Congress Members that they worked for. We just don’t know how badly they corrupted the system. We know they got money that they surely should not have. But let’s have an investigation into that. In the meantime, we owe it to all of those who gave their last full measure of devotion for this country, we owe it to them to do a better job here in Congress, passing better laws of giving people more liberty and more freedom for those who died for it. b1315 There is one thing that is absolutely certain, and Jesus knew what He was talking about—John 15:13: ‘‘Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.’’ He knew. He did it. And for all of those, Mr. Speaker, who have laid down their lives for Americans and for those around the world for their liberty, we just say thank you. Thank God for you. May God continue to bless America by giving us such patriots in the days ahead. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f
