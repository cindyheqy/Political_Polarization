Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, the Obama administration took a very positive and important step towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions by initiating the Clean Power Plan, the firstever national limit on carbon pollution from power plants. The plan was devised to give States the option to tailor how they would reduce carbon pollution, following benchmarks set by the Federal Government. For years, States, local governments, businesses, and universities have been making progress towards a lowcarbon future, both in anticipation of full implementation of the Clean Power Plan and spurred on by a variety of other forces. Now, the Trump administration has vowed to unravel the Clean Power Plan, but the momentum will not stop because of this reckless act. Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt cannot repeal engineering, science, or economics. Their attempts would only harm the economy and our citizens, miring us in the past to serve the interests of Big Coal. The case for action in reducing carbon pollution is compelling. The Clean Power Plan encourages steps to reduce the dangerous extent of accelerating climate disruption and attendant extreme weather events. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria are only the latest example of those events. Now, millions of acres in the West are exploding in wildfires. More frequent, more intense, and more dangerous forest fires are the reality now, spurred by climate disruption. Outofcontrol wildfire has touched Oregon’s beloved Columbia River Gorge, and the latest instances are in California wine country, taking lives, destroying property, and damaging crops. Regardless of your view on climate change, the Clean Power Plan is a very important step for the United States. It stands on firm legal ground. The Supreme Court has ruled on three separate occasions that the EPA has the authority and the responsibility to protect our families from carbon pollution. Cleaner energy and a cleaner environment under the Clean Power Plan would improve the lives of working Americans. By 2030, it would prevent 90,000 asthma attacks, 300,000 days missed from work and school, and 3,600 premature deaths every year. Instead of protecting human health, particularly those in communities most impacted by carbon pollution, Trump and Pruitt are seeking to tilt the energy playing field back in favor of Big Coal. Make no mistake: without subsidies and regulatory favoritism, most old, dirty, coal plants would have been shut down years ago if they had been required to meet carbon pollution and air quality standards, as they should have been. Trump and Pruitt are making a big mistake when they assault the Clean Air Act and the Clean Power Plan. They are on weak legal ground, and they are on the wrong side of science, economics, the environment, and common sense. The Clean Power Plan will not be easily unraveled. There is a process to unwind it, similar to what it took to put it in place. It will take a lot of hard work—and evidence that Pruitt doesn’t have—to repeal it and prevent the EPA from regulating carbon emissions. The plan has powerful allies. I am proud to stand with the environmental community, my fellow Democrats in Congress, many government and trade groups, citizens who care, and a number of businesses. Mars is the latest company to announce that they are going to follow through on their carbon reduction plan. We will continue this fight for a low carbon, healthier, more economical future. We will protect alternative energy and honor the commitments we have made to the wind and solar industries. We will continue to reduce emissions from our transportation sector by not rolling back fuel efficiency standards. We will work with the agriculture sector, which makes up 9 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions. A strong farm bill can reduce emissions and enhance productivity through low carbon protections. Ultimately, Trump and Pruitt cannot repeal science, engineering, or economics. I am proud to be part of this effort to ensure that the United States moves forward to exercise leadership in a low carbon future to fight climate change and global weather disruption. 
PROTECTING OUR SENIOR CITIZENS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask for my colleagues’ support for the Senior Citizen Protection Act, which I introduced along with my friend, Congressman BRADSCHNEIDER . Seniors are valued members of our society, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they can live with dignity and without fear of being abused by those entrusted to care for them. This bipartisan bill seeks to achieve that goal by creating a national registry for those convicted of elder abuse that will be accessible to senior care providers and families before they make a decision on whom they hire as a caregiver for their loved ones. This national database will bring together local and State registries in order to prevent abusers from continuing to inflict suffering on senior citizens by simply relocating from one community to another. I urge my colleagues to join Mr. SCHNEIDER and me in support of this measure that will help ensure that our parents, grandparents, and loved ones are looked after by professional caregivers who will give them the treatment and respect they deserve. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Protecting Seniors During Disasters Act, which I introduced with my colleague, Congresswoman LOISFRANKEL  of Florida. The horrific deaths of 14 seniors in a Florida nursing home facility in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma made it abundantly clear that more must be done to protect seniors during and after natural disasters. In times of emergency, many senior citizens find themselves disconnected from caregivers and without the treatments and resources that they so desperately need. Our bill seeks to reconnect seniors by requiring that Federal agencies assess how their emergency response efforts impact the elderly. It also calls for the implementation of standards to better protect and care for senior citizens and nursing home residents across our Nation during and after emergency situations. This is a commonsense, bipartisan legislative initiative that aims to save the lives of many senior citizens and helps ensure that the tragedy that took place in south Florida will not happen again. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this lifesaving measure. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we continue to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month and the many contributions of our vibrant community throughout our country, I would like to bring attention to a bill that I have sponsored that would permanently showcase the history and stories of American Latinos. H.R. 2911, the National Museum of the American Latino Act, will establish a worldclass educational institution on The National Mall for the millions of visitors who come to our Nation’s capital every year eager to learn about American history. Latinos have served our great country in every war dating back to before the Revolutionary War and continue to proudly serve in our military. They are smallbusiness owners, job creators, TV stars, athletes, and public servants. An initiative over 20 years in the making, this museum would be a visual representation of the difficulties that Latinos have overcome leaving their home countries, whether to flee an oppressive communist regime in my native homeland of Cuba, or Venezuela, or for the opportunity to partake in the American Dream, as well as the 
story of Hispanics who have made the U.S. their home for many generations. As the first Hispanic woman elected to the U.S. Congress, I am proud to invite my colleagues to join me in this endeavor and cosponsor H.R. 2911, the National Museum of the American Latino Act. 
ASSISTANCE FOR PUERTO RICO The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, it has been 3 weeks since the eye of Hurricane Maria crossed over Puerto Rico. It has been 3 weeks, and there are still parts of the island that have not had contact with FEMA yet—3 weeks. For most people, that has meant no power, and most still don’t have running water. Hospitals and clinics were hit hard, as The New York Times reports. The daughter of one man who died because he couldn’t receive oxygen treatment told the paper: ‘‘Because of the electricity situation, a lot of people died and are still dying.’’ Forty percent of the island still lacks running water because of the blackout, which still affects 85 percent of the island. As a result, many people are bathing in streams and receiving water from huge tanks, which is never a good idea. This is after 3 weeks in the most powerful nation on Earth. This is unacceptable. Our response to Hurricane Maria and the people of Puerto Rico is a national and international embarrassment and a tragedy. They are our own citizens in our own Caribbean colonies of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and we have not helped them all that we can. I spoke to Chicago firefighters yesterday who have been in Puerto Rico for about a week, and they tell me it is worse than we are being told. b1015 They told me yesterday that they are still making contact in towns where people come up to them and say, ‘‘Thank God, it is FEMA; you are finally here,’’ only to be told, ‘‘No, we are not FEMA; we are from Chicago; we are firefighters,’’ and they embrace and cry with gratitude. Last week, a group of my colleagues and I got together. We represent large Puerto Rican communities here on the mainland in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, and Florida. All of us have been contacted by our constituents who are in desperate need to get their loved ones back and out of Puerto Rico. After 3 weeks, they have run out of patience and are not interested in excuses in our congressional district. They want their parents, they want their Tia with cancer, and they want their cousins on dialysis off the island, period, now. They want a plane ticket to get the hell out. Our communities are ready. Lorain, Ohio; Hartford; Boston; Orlando; New York; Chicago; we are all ready, but the problem is transportation. If you have money, connections, or internet access, then you probably can find a flight out. I know this because I was in Puerto Rico 2 weeks ago, and I saw the Land Rovers, the Jaguars, parked at the private airports in San Juan, because if you have the money, you have already put your loved ones on a flight out of Dodge. The individuals from FEMA have been doing a great job, given the constraints, but I think now FEMA and the military resources should focus on the task of evacuating the elderly, the sick, and the vulnerable from the island. Look, this is the way FEMA works. They say: Well, we only take on tasks that the Governor asks us to take on, and the Governor is not likely to go to FEMA to ask them to get thousands and thousands of his constituents off the island. Number one, it is a difficult request for any local official to make. Captains of industry and leaders on the island want to make sure that there are Puerto Rican workers there to rebuild, and of course, to continue to buy their products. I get that. But at the same time, those same captains of industry and political leaders, guess what, I bet you most of them have already got their loved ones off the island. Number two, we know the Governor has to be extremely careful how he asks for anything because we all know the President doesn’t take criticism very well or even a hint of criticism. The Governor doesn’t want to get blackballed by the President who might go off on a Twitter rant at any moment unless he is praised and stroked every step of the way. But our Puerto Rican constituents don’t vote for the Governor of Puerto Rico. They vote for us, for DELAURO , for CROWLEY , for M CGOVERN , for ESPAILLAT , for M ARCY KAPTUR , and they want us to help them get their families out of danger’s way. They are demanding help getting their family members out, and I think FEMA and the U.S. military can do the job. They just need the orders from the people in charge. Let’s be clear: if anyone wants to leave Puerto Rico, they should have our help in doing so. For thousands, it is a question of life and death and survival. That is what is needed to help Puerto Rico. We don’t need the President tossing paper towels to storm victims like he was tossing a ball to a dog or maybe tossing peanuts to squirrels in the park. We need airplanes, ships, and helicopters to get the people the hell out; otherwise, it will be worse than let them eat cake; it is let them die. 
CELEBRATING THE WORK OF TERESA LEWIS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the work of a very wonderful constituent of the Fifth District of North Carolina, Teresa Lewis. Every September, we celebrate American Business Women’s Day in order to recognize the many different backgrounds and diverse occupations of American businesswomen. However, it is my belief that we should celebrate American businesswomen like Teresa Lewis every day. Teresa’s success was born out of determination and the desire to provide a better life for her family. In 1986, Teresa founded WorkForce Carolina, a professional staffing service that includes recruitment, interview completion, and skills assessment. As CEO of WorkForce Carolina, Teresa has employed thousands of people, and her company has served as a boon to the North Carolina economy. Most importantly, Teresa serves as a role model to all women and men in our country. I commend Teresa Lewis on all of her many accomplishments and thank her for all she does for the community. 
CRITICAL TIME OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR PUERTO RICO AND VIRGIN ISLANDS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, this is a critical time of life and death for millions of U.S. citizens on the island of Puerto Rico and also in the Virgin Islands. The efforts to rebuild will be great, and we each have a critical role to play to help these families recover following the aftermath of these catastrophic storms. We have witnessed so much devastation this hurricane season, and the impact has been particularly destructive and wreaked havoc. It has left millions of U.S. families without shelter, electricity, and their lives in ruin. We all have a part to play in the recovery efforts and must answer the calls to provide relief and aid in the immense rebuilding efforts that will take place to assist all of them who have been affected. The amount of help and heart I have seen in my home State of New York, including a recent effort of Uptown United this weekend, and from constituents of mine like LinManuel Miranda, and even from children willing to crack open their piggybanks has been overwhelming. If the Federal Government could have matched that compassion, then Puerto Rico would be well on its way to recovery. Last night, the House Appropriations Committee released a $36.5 billion disaster relief package: $5 billion of that will go directly to Puerto Rico; $14 billion for FEMA’s disaster fund; and $16 
billion for the National Flood Insurance Program. I see this as an initial downpayment. I hope this is just the beginning. Nearly a month into this crisis, the status of Puerto Rico today is such: The Jones Act. On Sunday, the White House let the 10day shipping waiver for the Jones Act expire for Puerto Rico, meaning that foreign ships can no longer bring aid to the hurricane ravaged island from U.S. ports. I have been pushing for at least a 1year waiver and a permanent waiver for oil. Electricity. To date, only 15 percent of Puerto Ricans have power and electricity, not being able to get in contact with their loved ones and the great impact the lack of electricity has on patients with dialysis. Water. Access to clean drinking water lingers around 20 percent. It is reported that seaborne bacteria are contaminating the water supply. This may lead to bacterial infections such as cholera, dysentery, E. coli, and typhoid. That can be really disastrous. The typical treatments for these illnesses, like tetanus shots and powerful antibiotics, are not readily available on the island where medical supplies are quickly running out. The damage estimates. It is calculated around $95 billion. This is roughly 150 percent of the Puerto Rican annual gross national product. The downpayment really should be $10 billion to $15 billion. The budget. The White House has reported that they have asked Congress to authorize approximately $30 billion in new disasterrelated funding. Fatalities. Mr. Speaker, the official death toll has increased to 43 deaths directly or indirectly related to Hurricane Maria. The death toll, unfortunately, will continue to rise, and this is becoming more and more our Caribbean Katrina. I urge my colleagues to pass the Disaster Relief Fund for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Caribbean. 
THANKING TEAM RUBICON The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a few minutes to talk about and thank Team Rubicon and all other volunteers who are helping assist victims of Hurricane Harvey with storm cleanup, not only in the district I represent but throughout the State of Texas. Many of our cities still have piles and piles of debris. Initially, it was trees and brushes cleared, but now, as people are starting to survey and repair the damage to their home, there is insulation, there is sheetrock, there are personal belongings all out along the street waiting to be picked up and cleaned up. This Monday, I spent time with the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, visiting some of our cities, and they are telling me that the cleanup may not be complete in some cities, like Port Aransas and Rockport, until December or January. There is a big job ahead. It is going to take a lot of people. Several weeks ago, Speaker RYAN and several members of the Texas delegation joined Team Rubicon in the Houston area aiding in demolition and cleanup in the flooddevastated areas. The group’s positive attitude and commitment to service is inspiring. Last week, Janice Dean of FOX News visited the district I represent and told the story about how Team Rubicon is helping with debris removal in Wharton, Texas. That is a city of about 9,000 south of Houston that was devastated by flood waters associated with the storm. You know, Team Rubicon was founded in 2010, following the earthquakes in Haiti, by two marines, Jake Wood and William McNulty, who knew they could use their military experience and go out and help others. Since then, Team Rubicon has drastically expanded across the Nation, uniting the skills and experiences of veterans and first responders to rapidly deploy emergency response teams. I want to thank Team Rubicon for all the help they have provided the folks of Texas, especially Wharton, and the people around the world who have suffered disasters since 2010. I also want to thank Janice Dean of FOX News for helping tell their story. Janice’s commitment to Team Rubicon didn’t stop with just telling the story. In fact, once the story aired, she has donated $15,000 from sales of her children’s book, ‘‘Freddy the Frogcaster’’ to Team Rubicon and will continue to be donating all proceeds from this book to the group. Thank you, Janice. Thank you, Team Rubicon, and thank you for everyone who is helping out those who are victims of Hurricane Harvey and the various other disasters that this Nation is facing right now. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF FIRST SERGEANT CHARLESTON HARTFIELD OF THE NEVADA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. ROSEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of my constituent, First Sergeant Charleston Hartfield of the Nevada Army National Guard. Our community lost a trueblue American hero on the 1st of October. Since the age of 18, Officer Hartfield valiantly served our country and our community, spending 16 years in the Army both on Active Duty and in the Nevada National Guard and 11 years in our local law enforcement. First Sergeant Hartfield spent a year deployed to Iraq with the 82nd Airborne Division as part of the initial invasion in 2003, where they were awarded the Combat Action Badge for having bravely engaged in combat operations. Those who knew Officer Hartfield remember him for his kindness to others and for pouring his heart into our community as a husband, a father, a friend, and a youth football coach. Officer Charleston Hartfield was taken from us far too soon by a senseless tragedy. Our valley and this Nation will mourn his loss, and we will carry forward his spirit of courage and selflessness. b1030 REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE  
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to put into words the devastation and heartbreak my community suffered on October 1, 2017. This horrific violence has forever altered the lives of countless families in Las Vegas and across this country. My heart breaks for those who lost a parent, a child, a sibling, and a friend. And while this was the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, I know that we join a long list of communities: Sandy Hook, Aurora, Tucson, San Bernardino, and Orlando, all who have suffered way too much through similar heartwrenching violence. I have lived in southern Nevada for nearly 40 years, and I will tell you that I have been overwhelmed by the resilience of Las Vegas. We are not just ‘‘Sin City’’ or the glittering lights of the strip. We are also a tightknit, compassionate community of hardworking families. The shooting on October 1 exemplified the worst of humanity, but our response represented the very best of people. As we try to figure out how to move forward, I can tell you that we are finding strength and hope and courage in our brave first responders, in the heroic selfsacrifice of men and women who risked and gave their lives for others, and for the kindness of strangers who helped transport the wounded to the hospital, who stood in line for hours to donate blood, and who came together to support the survivors. I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find that same courage to come to the table and have real conversations about commonsense solutions to address gun violence. There is no single policy solution, but I know we can support the Second Amendment while taking reasonable steps to reduce the carnage inflicted on our communities by gun violence and mass shootings. Mr. Speaker, devices designed to cause mass casualties, like bump stocks and highcapacity magazines, have no practical purpose for hunting or selfdefense. They only increase the threat for potential victims trying to find safety, like those at the Mandalay Bay, and they make it more challenging for law enforcement to confront and neutralize an active shooter. I urge all of my colleagues to please join together in a bipartisan effort. We need to take commonsense steps in Congress to decrease the scope of widespread destruction and tragic mass shootings. 
No community should ever be forced to experience the grief and trauma that my constituents are now confronting. It is more urgent than ever that we take meaningful action to reduce the toll of widespread gun violence. The time is now. 
RECERTIFY IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the significance of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding Iran, more commonly referred to as the Iran nuclear agreement. I have always been a vocal advocate for tough sanctions on Iran. While I was a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in 2010, I was a member of the conference committee which drafted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act. These sanctions, in 2010 and subsequently, did make a difference. Unfortunately, Iran continues to support terrorist organizations, and its record on human rights is well known. But we should not withhold certification of the Iran nuclear agreement without credible evidence that Iran is not complying. Let’s remember, this agreement has always been about Iran, not obtaining nuclear weapons. Doing so would strip the United States of our credibility in future international agreements not just with Iran, but with our allies as well. In addition to Iran, we negotiated the Iran nuclear agreement with the United Kingdom, Germany, European Union, China, and Russia, and we must keep our word. In other words, to remain credible, the United States cannot change positions on international agreements from one administration to another without serious justification and without the consent in working with our allies. Especially now, as we are facing an increasing threat with North Korea, we must work with our allies and, together, make a safer world through a comprehensive strategy that involves diplomacy, sanctions, and, yes, deterrence, if we must use such force. We have methods for addressing Iran’s nonnuclear behavior besides refusing to recertify the agreement, and I will continue to advocate for the use of these tools to take a strong stance against Iran for their support of terrorist state activities and their abuse of human rights. But refusing to recertify the Iran nuclear agreement, without clear evidence that Iran has breached the agreement, will deeply damage our relationships with our allies, and it will weaken our credibility worldwide. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month, which is from September 15 to October 15 every year. This month we honor and celebrate the history, culture, achievements, and contributions of Hispanic leaders in communities throughout our great country. From serving in our Armed Forces, to starting businesses that further develop our economy and provide employment for Americans, Hispanics have contributed great advancements in science, medicine, literature, and education. The Hispanic community and its people have been critical in shaping our Nation and the valley that I have the honor to represent. For example, in my home State of California alone, there are over 815,000 Hispanic or Latinoowned companies, which, together, generate over $98.9 billion in general receipts in our economy. In Fresno, Merced, and Madera counties, which I represent, there are nearly 27,000 Hispanic or Latinoowned companies, which, together, generated, last year, over $2 billion, $700 million in our economy. The story of our Hispanic friends, neighbors, and loved ones is the story of the American Dream, as they have the same hope and aspiration that all Americans have: to make a better life for themselves and their families through hard work, access to a better education, and equal treatment under the law. Let us remember, after all, we are a nation of immigrants past and present. For over 250 years, since the formation of the United States, immigrants have come from all over the world to America to have a better life for themselves and, in turn, have made us the greatest country in the world. During Hispanic Heritage Month, I am honored to celebrate the community whose determination and achievements are an integral part of not only our Nation, but the San Joaquin Valley that I have the honor to represent. f 
SUPPORT FOR NFL FOOTBALL PLAYERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise and stand in the well of the Congress of the United States of America. I am always honored that I have this opportunity, and I see it as a preeminent privilege to be able to stand in the well of the Congress of the United States of America. I love my country. I have said it many times right here at this podium. I salute the flag, Mr. Speaker. I say the Pledge of Allegiance. I sing the national anthem. I love my country. And because I love my country, I can stand here in the well of the House of the United States of America and announce that I support the NFL men, who are professional football players. I can say I support them because I believe in what the flag stands for: liberty and justice for all. I believe in this. And if there is to be liberty and justice for all, the cause that they are part of has to be called to the attention of the American public. I support the NFL players, Mr. Speaker. To those who say that ‘‘they are so lucky, they are making millions, why don’t they just play football, they ought to be happy,’’ first, let me comment in this way: They are earning millions. Their bodies are being torn apart, in many cases. They are earning millions. They get concussions. They are earning millions. They suffer after they leave football. They are earning millions. And they are also earning pain as they play a game that amuses many. So those who say they are making plenty of money and they ought to just go away, I contend that they are not doing it for the money. They are doing it because they understand injustice anywhere is still a threat to justice everywhere, as Dr. King put it. They want to eliminate the injustice that they see, and, in so doing, they have decided to take a knee. I salute the flag. I support my country. I love my country. And I respect what they are doing in the form of peaceful protest to bring about change that ought to have been brought about decades or centuries ago; should have been, but has not been. Yes, we have come a long way, but we sure have a long way to go. Now, to those who say ‘‘they have earned millions, why aren’t they happy,’’ well, it is not hush money. Is that what you are saying, that when they get paid, that is hush money that says that they don’t have freedom of speech? Does that check negate their freedom of speech? I think not. Freedom of speech is something that you cherish, whether you live in a mansion or you live under a bridge. Freedom of speech belongs to you. It doesn’t matter your station in life. It doesn’t matter your ethnicity. It doesn’t matter your religiosity. Freedom of speech belongs to you because you are a child of God and you live in the greatest country in the world. So I stand in support of the NFL players. I want them to continue. I want them to stand their ground. I want this movement to continue. And I want those who were thwarted to know that you are trying to thwart injustice. When you try to change the subject and make it about something that it is not, you are trying to thwart injustice. Even if you don’t do it with intentionality, that is the reality. We cannot allow injustice to continue. And I thank God that there are those who are making millions, those who are having their bodies abused, who are willing to take a stand by taking a knee against injustice, and they still respect this country and its flag and this anthem. If there is one among them who has other thoughts, then I don’t support that. I support those who have a righteous cause and who are respectful of the country, who can love the flag and still protest. I support that. 
I am an American. I was born in the United States of America. I am a patriotic American. I believe in this country. And if you believe in it, you ought to allow peaceful protest to continue, because John F. Kennedy was right when he was paraphrased by Dr. King: 
Those who make peaceful protest impossible will make other forms of protest inevitable. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 42 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend Molly Fraser, Gig Harbor United Methodist Church, Gig Harbor, Washington, offered the following prayer: God of many names, we give thanks for the opportunity to serve. Remind us that we are servants of our country, our people, and the land. Let us not forget all the blessings You have given us so that we might use our power and influence to help order the country in ways that allow each and every person to find life and liberty and to pursue happiness. We come, perhaps, already weary from an onslaught of emails, texts, tweets, phone calls, and meetings where people make demands on how we vote and assumptions about every decision that we put forward. Help us, O God, to do the right thing, not just for a few, but for the many. Help us work together diligently so we might see the fruit of our effort grow into good throughout our country, which can serve to make this world more livable for all. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. BABIN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING REVEREND MOLLY FRASER The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to welcome Pastor Molly Fraser from Gig Harbor United Methodist Church, my home church. Our church isn’t the biggest church, it isn’t the oldest church, but it has left a large impact throughout Gig Harbor because it makes clear that all are welcome. Whether you are in pain and need somewhere to go or you are looking for fellowship, there is a welcome mat for you. It makes clear to regular attendees and to newcomers that it is a place of open hearts, open minds, and open doors. It is a place that is committed to supporting the needs of those most in need throughout our community and around the world. It is a place to ask tough questions and to celebrate our faith. Finally, it is a place that benefits from the tremendous leadership of Pastor Molly, who, during her brief tenure with the church, has brought incredible energy and heart and musical talent. She is here in our Nation’s capital today with her family. It is my honor to welcome them and, in spirit, the entire congregation of Gig Harbor United Methodist Church. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize the Army National Guard’s 236th Engineering Company. Located in Stephenville, Texas, they were the first on the ground in Houston to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief efforts on August 27. Over the course of a week, they rescued approximately 2,300 civilians and 380 animals from flooded areas. Mr. Speaker, these men and women who serve our country are true heroes, and I am honored to represent them in the 25th Congressional District of Texas. I had the opportunity to meet with these soldiers a few weeks ago and personally shake their hands to thank them for a job well done. They stepped up in a moment of absolute crisis and when the people of Texas needed them most. They put their lives on the line in order to save others. Without them, the number of deaths could have been significantly higher. It is because of selfless people like these that America is able to remain the strongest country in the world. The Lone Star State cannot thank them enough for their swift and noble actions, and we will always remember their heroism. Hurricane Harvey victims are still recovering, and all of America is behind them. We will rebuild together because we are all Texas strong. God bless Texas, God bless the military, and God bless the United States of America. In God we trust. f 
HONORING JAHEIR MOORE FOR SERVICE TO HIS COMMUNITY (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jaheir Moore, a seventh grade student from Jersey City, New Jersey, for his service to people in need. This young man from my district takes the time nearly every day to crochet hats, scarves, blankets, and other items for people in homeless shelters and newborn babies in intensive care units. Over the past couple of years, he has donated dozens of bags full of his creations to make life a little better for others. Jaheir is a straight A student who wants to become a fashion designer. In February, he was a guest on the ‘‘Rachael Ray Show.’’ A week later, Jaheir had his first runway show in Jersey City. In April, I presented him with a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition for his charity work. Mr. Speaker, Jaheir Moore’s unselfish acts of kindness for people in need shows that our country’s future is a bright one. 
ALLEN COUNTY RIGHT TO LIFE (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, on Monday night, I had the privilege of attending the Allen County Right to Life’s 20th annual Uniting Our City for Life Banquet. The event was a wonderful time with fellow Hoosiers who share a common concern for the sanctity of innocent human life, from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death. It also was a celebration of the fact that our culture increasingly is recognizing the value of human life. A poll released last year found that a majority of young Americans support increasing restrictions that protect the unborn. Another recent poll found that 61 percent of Americans oppose using tax dollars to fund abortions. This 
growing recognition that life is a precious and sacred gift is due, in large part, to the tireless efforts of organizations like Allen County Right to Life. I want to express special thanks to Allen County Right to Life Executive Director Cathie Humbarger and Operations Director Abigail Lorenzen for all they do in northeast Indiana to promote life and defend the unborn. I also want to congratulate Pat Miller on receiving the Daniel Award for prolife commitment during Monday night’s dinner. Throughout his career, he has been a consistent and compassionate voice for the cause of life, and there is no one more deserving of this prestigious award. 
BILLIONAIRES FIRST TAX PLAN (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, last week, Republicans brought their extreme budget to the floor, a budget that forces the middle class to pay more in taxes just to give the wealthiest Americans a massive tax break. This budget slashes investments in our future, such as rebuilding roads and bridges and education, just so it can provide huge tax breaks to the absolute wealthiest Americans. Billionaires would receive a massive tax cut under this plan. Under this ‘‘billionaires first’’ tax plan, according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, middle class families would pay an average of $1,290 a year more in taxes, while 80 percent of the benefits would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans: the superwealthy. By repealing the estate tax, 5,400 families would receive a $270 billion tax break. Who pays for this? The middle class. How? By passing the costs on to them and increasing our deficit at the same time. Trillions of dollars would be added to our deficit. Giving billionaires a massive tax break is fiscally irresponsible and morally wrong. We ought to reject it. 
PRAISING PENNSYLVANIA NATIONAL GUARD FOR HELPING WITH PUERTO RICO RELIEF EFFORTS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend 42 members of the Pennsylvania National Guard who are currently in Puerto Rico assisting with hurricane relief efforts. Thousands of National Guard members are working in both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to help our fellow Americans recover from devastating hurricanes. Hurricane Maria, with its Category 5 winds, was the fifth strongest storm to ever hit the U.S. and the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico in 80 years. What it left behind was vast devastation and great damage to infrastructure and energy distribution systems. Mr. Speaker, I am tremendously proud of our Pennsylvania Guardsmen who are on the ground assisting with this humanitarian disaster. They welcomed the call to action and are working to restore Puerto Rico’s infrastructure, install additional telecommunications equipment to connect families and businesses, and deliver more than 300 generators to provide electricity to those who need it. We are working on rebuilding, and the Pennsylvania National Guard is there to aid in the recovery effort. It is the American way to have all hands on deck, and I am grateful for their efforts. f 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, domestic violence often hides behind closed doors and drawn curtains, but the problem is very staggering. In my home State of Hawaii, 575 domestic violence survivors reach out to local organizations seeking help every single day. Their stories are heartbreaking and, too often, even if they are temporarily removed from the abusive environment, they are often returned to their abuser. Survivors can seek legal protection from their abusers, but they aren’t likely to do so or be successful unless they have a lawyer. Just 32 percent of victims successfully obtain a restraining order without legal representation. I call on my colleagues to support the POWER Act, which requires every State’s U.S. attorney to promote and expand pro bono legal services specifically for domestic violence survivors. We all need to be more conscious of this problem because it is happening in our communities. As we observe Domestic Violence Awareness Month, let us have the courage to confront the pervasiveness of this crime and take action to help provide survivors with the safety and security they need. 
MEDIA IGNORES DONATION TO ANTICOP GROUP (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, you may have heard of Colin Kaepernick, the football quarterback who started ‘‘the kneel’’ to protest the national anthem at NFL games. He was the originator of the resistance movement in the NFL against police officers. But you likely haven’t heard that he donated $25,000 to a group that was named after a convicted cop killer. Neither national broadcast stations nor major daily newspapers reported the donation to an organization honoring Assata Shakur, who escaped prison and fled to Cuba after being found guilty in the 1973 murder of police officer Werner Foerster. Assata is currently on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists list. Why did the liberal national media think this story was not newsworthy? Do they agree with Kaepernick? Do they approve of contributions to organizations named after cop killers? The liberal national media seems to have a grudge against law enforcement and patriotism, as well as religion and traditional values, based on their lack of fair coverage of those subjects. This might explain why the media’s credibility is at a record low. f 
CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Trump administration rolled back contraceptive care for hundreds of thousands of women. They called it a victory for religious liberty. But let’s be real. This is just one part of the White House’s fight to strip women of their independence and healthcare. First, they came for title X, scaling back the essential family planning centers that served lowincome women. They attacked Planned Parenthood, pledging to block access for the millions of women who depend on it. They expanded the global gag rule, a policy that will limit the preventative healthcare options for women across the world. Then, they turned their destructive sights on title IX, scaling back crucial guidances that protect sexual assault victims on our college campuses. Now, they have opened the door for bosses to deny contraceptive coverage for their female employees. Let’s not pretend this is a victory for religious freedom. This is about taking away women’s choices. 
HONORING DR. DANIEL J. BRADLEY ON HIS RETIREMENT (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true champion for higher education, Dr. Daniel J. Bradley, the 11th president of Indiana State University. During his 9year tenure at Indiana State, Dr. Bradley has led ISU to achieve the highest enrollment in school history, added new degree programs to meet the demands of the 21st century workforce, and completed more than $300 million in capital projects on the campus. Most importantly, Dr. Bradley has improved student success by increasing the student retention rate and increasing the student graduation rate. 
From his service to our country in the U.S. Army to his service to the students of Indiana State University, I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Bradley on his retirement at the end of this year. 
b1215 CHALLENGE TO DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO WORK TOGETHER TO PASS A DACA FIX (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, there are upwards of 800,000 DREAMers in our country—young, de facto Americans, people who grew up here, are as American as you or I, American in fact, albeit not in law. They are able to work legally under the deferred action, or DACA program, that President Obama has set up. That has been jeopardized by an announcement that President Trump will be terminating that program within 6 months. Now we are down to about 4
1⁄2 months, a challenge to this body, Democrats and Republicans, to work together to rectify the legal situation of 800,000 de facto Americans. This body must act. We can’t leave these young Americans in limbo with regard to what their future prospects are to work. Make no bones about it, if this body fails to act, over 800,000 aspiring Americans will no longer be able to go to work legally the very next day after deferred action expires. In the interest of unifying families, in the interest of these young people who are as American as you or I, in the interest of our economic growth and prosperity, I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stop playing politics and finally pass a DACA fix, like the Dream Act, into law to make sure that they can give back to the country that has given so much to them. 
IMPACT OF RECENT HURRICANES (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, it was great to participate in this morning’s board of delegation meeting, during which we discussed the impact of recent hurricanes on our State and unmet needs to require further attention. With the onslaught of natural disasters that have plagued our country in recent months, we must provide appropriate levels of Federal support to all who are suffering. However, we must also ensure that Florida’s ongoing needs are not overlooked as we seek to fully recover. Our two largest industries, tourism and agriculture, have sustained significant losses, which will have a long term impact on our economy, unfortunately. We also learned valuable lessons during the hurricane as it relates to the care for our most vulnerable citizens, our seniors and the disabled. These lessons need to translate to action in order to prevent future tragedies. I look forward to working with my colleagues as we evaluate the proposed natural disaster funding bill that will be voted on later this week and determine its impact on Florida. f 
HONORING DAVE DAVIS (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend of mine, Dave Davis, who passed away recently. Dave was a giant Purdue fan, but we first met at a UCLA basketball game over 20 years ago. We immediately struck up a friendship, and in 2000, when I announced I was running for Congress, Dave was all in and, despite the long odds, took vacation time to drive me all around Madison County. We didn’t win that one, but that is the kind of guy Dave Davis was. He put others first, sharing in your successes and your struggles as if they were his own. Dave had a great smile and a rare quality: he saw everyone for who they could be, not just what they were. Dave spent his career in public service for our State and our Nation, but his most important priority was his family. He never passed up an opportunity to talk about his wife, Robyn; or his kids, Alex, Amy, and Eric. Dave Davis was a good man and my friend. Congratulations on a life well lived. Godspeed. 
REFORMING THE TAX CODE (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about our efforts here in the people’s House to reform our Tax Code and reduce the burden of the Federal Government on every American. Right now, Americans know that our Tax Code is unfair, it is too long, and it is too complicated. It has been 30 years since we have made meaningful reforms, and the time for that change is now. House and Senate Republicans have announced reforms that will make the Tax Code simpler, with more than 90 percent of filers being able to do their returns on a simple postcard. We have asked to make the Tax Code fair for middle class Americans, lowering their rates and doubling their standard deduction. We have asked to give relief to lowincome Americans by eliminating the lowest 10 percent bracket completely and cutting the 15 percent bracket to 12. We have asked to crack down on tax avoidance by ending the dozens and dozens of loopholes that only the wealthiest taxpayers and corporations can take advantage of. Mr. Speaker, we have a unique opportunity to do so much for hardworking families across America. I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join us, offer solutions, and make this a bipartisan effort to give the American people the relief they deserve. f 
RISING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE (Mr. AL GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the many who have concluded that enough is enough. I rise today to speak on behalf of the many persons who believe that Article II, section 4 of the Constitution of the United States of America has meaning and that it is something that is appropriate for a time such as this, appropriate for a time when there is one among us who seems to incite hatred, bigotry, and invidious discrimination. I rise to speak on their behalf today, Mr. Speaker, and I do so understanding that I am not doing it on behalf of Republicans, generally speaking, or Democrats, generally speaking. The people whom I reference are Americans, generally speaking. So I rise to speak on their behalf. 
NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I seek recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges of the House. The form of the resolution is as follows: Articles of Impeachment against Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, in the Congress of the United States of America. Resolution. Resolved, that Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, has undermined the integrity of his office with impunity and has brought disrepute on the Presidency with immunity, has betrayed his trust as President to the manifest injury of the American people and is unfit to be President, and is impeached pursuant to Article II, section IV of the Constitution of the United States of America, and that the following Articles of Impeachment be exhibited to the United States Senate: Articles of Impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in the name of itself and of all of the people of the 
United States of America against Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors of a nature which may, with peculiar propriety, be denominated as political, not requiring the commission of a crime, and exclusively the jurisdiction of the United States House of Representatives for impeachment purposes. Article I: That Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, unmindful of his high duties of his office and the dignity and proprieties thereof, and the harmony, respect, and courtesies, which ought to exhibit and be maintained in American society, has under the inane pretext of dispensing with political correctness, produced a demonstrable record of inciting white supremacy, sexism, bigotry, hatred, xenophobia, racebaiting, and racism by demeaning, defaming, disrespecting, and disparaging women and certain minorities. In so doing, Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, has fueled and is fueling an altright hate machine and its worldwide covert sympathizers engendering racial antipathy, LGBTQ enmity, religious anxiety, stealthy sexism, and dreadful xenophobia, perfidiously causing immediate injury to American society, to wit: On September 23, 2017, Donald John Trump incited racebaiting and racism, engendering stealthy sexism and racial antipathy, when he disrespected, disparaged, and demeaned mothers of professional football players by calling them dogs as he made the widely published statement: 
Won’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, say, Get that sonofaBITCH off the field right now, out. He’s fired. He’s fired. 
On September 23, 2017, Donald John Trump incited racebaiting and racism, engendering racial antipathy, when he disrespected and disparaged professional football players, approximately 70 percent of whom are reportedly African American, by calling them sons of dogs as he made the widely published statement: 
Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, say, Get that sonofaBITCH off the field right now, out. He’s fired. He’s fired. 
On September 30, 2017, Donald John Trump incited bigotry and racebaiting, engendering racial antipathy, when he disrespected, disparaged, and demeaned Puerto Ricans, who are Americans, by implying Puerto Ricans want others to do for them what they won’t do for themselves, as he made the widely published claim: 
They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 
Further, on October 3, 2017, while in Puerto Rico, as was widely shown on American television, Donald John Trump incited bigotry, engendering racial antipathy, when he disparaged Puerto Ricans by stating: I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, and that’s fine. But we’ve saved a lot of lives. 
The President did not make similar widely published statements about Texas or Florida. b1230 On January 27, 2017, Donald John Trump incited xenophobia and hate against Muslims in the United States of America, engendering religious anxiety, when he disrespected Islam by issuing Executive Order 13769, fulfilling a campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States of America. This widely published campaign promise is dated December 7, 2015, and reads as follows: 
Donald J. Trump Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration, New York, New York, December 7, 2015. Donald J. Trump is calling for the total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on. 
On March 4, 2017, Donald John Trump incited racebaiting and racism, engendering racial antipathy, when he defamed, disrespected, and disparaged President Barack Obama by making the widely published statement, which has since been disclaimed: 
Terrible. Just found out that Obama had my ‘‘wires tapped’’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism. 
On July 26, 2017, Donald John Trump incited bigotry, engendering LGBTQ enmity, when he disparaged and disrespected transgender Americans by indicating that the costs of their medical care outweighs the sacrifice they are willing to make for our country as he made the widely published statement: 
After consultation with my generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. 
In so doing, the aforementioned Donald John Trump, unmindful of the high duties of his high office and the dignity and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony, respect, and courtesies which ought to exist and be maintained within American society, has undermined the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency, has betrayed his trust as President to the manifest injury of the people of the United States of America, and, as a result is unfit to be President. Therefore, Donald John Trump, by betraying his trust as President, warrants impeachment, trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States of America. Article II: That Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, unmindful of the high duties of his high office and the dignity and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony and courtesies which ought to exist and be maintained within American society, did betray his trust as President and bring shame and dishonor to the office of the Presidency by associating the majesty and dignity of the Presidency with causes rooted in White supremacy, bigotry, racism, antiSemitism, White nationalism, and neoNazism when he, to wit: On August 15, 2017, Donald John Trump made a widely published statement characterizing a group of anti Semites, bigots, racists, White nationalists, and Klu Klux Klansmen who rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia, as ‘‘very fine people.’’ Thereafter, on August 23, 2017, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination released a 2page decision in which it was stated that they were ‘‘disturbed by the failure at the highest political level of the United States of America to unequivocally reject and condemn the racist violent events and demonstrations led by the aforementioned groups, thereby potentially fueling the proliferation of racist discourse and incidents throughout the State party, and deeply concerned by the example this failure could set for the rest of the world.’’ On October 7, 2017, hate groups were again back in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the statue of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, chanting, ‘‘You will not replace us.’’ Since this event on October 7, the President has made many widely published statements about many things including, but not limited to, the National Football League, but has not made one widely published statement condemning the hate groups for returning to the place where an innocent person lost her life at the hands of hate. In so doing, the aforementioned Donald John Trump, unmindful of the high duties of his high office and the integrity and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony, respect, and courtesies which ought to exist and be maintained within American society, has undermined the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency, and has betrayed his trust as President to the manifest injury of the people of the United States of America, and is unfit to be President. Therefore, Donald John Trump, by betraying his trust as President, warrants impeachment, trial, and removal from office and the disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States of America. Article III: Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, unmindful of his high duties of his high office and the dignity and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony and courtesies which ought to exist and be maintained in American society, did engage in perfidy by making the widely reported claim that 3 to 5 
million people voted illegally in the 2016 Presidential election and, further, expending tax dollars to establish a commission to investigate his claim, to wit: On November 27, 2016, Donald John Trump made the widely reported claim that: 
In addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally . . . in Virginia, New Hampshire, and California. So why isn’t the media reporting on this? Serious bias. Big problem. 
On January 25, 2017, Donald John Trump made the widely reported claim that: 
I will be asking for a major investigation into voter fraud, including those registered to vote in two States, and who are illegal and. . . . 
On July 1, 2017, Donald John Trump made the widely reported claim that: 
Numerous States were refusing to give information to the very distinguished voter fraud panel. What are they trying to hide? 
On June 28, 2017, according to highly reported news stories, the commission previously referenced by Donald John Trump requested detailed voter registration data from all 50 States, including names, addresses, and other sensitive data from every voter in the country. Several States refused to send the information, and some States have been prevented by courts from turning over the information. In so doing, the aforementioned Donald John Trump, unmindful of the high duties of his high office and the dignity and proprieties thereof, has undermined the integrity of his office and has brought disrepute on the Presidency and has betrayed his trust as President to the manifest injury of the people of the United States of America, and is unfit to be President. Therefore, Donald John Trump, by betraying his trust as President, warrants impeachment, trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States of America. Article IV: Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, unmindful of the high duties of his high office and of the dignity and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony and courtesies which ought to exist and be maintained in American society, while aware of the widely reported history of unlawful abuses and brutality perpetrated by many, not all, police officers against innocent persons in the United States of America, did betray his trust as President, bringing shame and dishonor to the office of the Presidency by encouraging law enforcement officials to violate the constitutional rights of suspects in their custody and control, to wit: On July 28, 2017, Donald John Trump, in a speech in front of the Suffolk County Police Department in Long Island, New York, stated that: 
And when you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in—rough. I said, ‘‘Please don’t be too nice.’’ Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? Like, don’t hit their head, and they’ve just killed somebody—don’t hit their head. I said, ‘‘You can take the hand away, okay?’’ This statement is injurious not only to the rule of law, which presumes innocence until guilt is proven in a court of law, but also to the administration of justice, which requires that care is given to persons held in the custody of law enforcement. Our Nation is founded upon a social contract where the constitutional rights of the individual are not surrendered because he or she is accused of a crime. To speak to the contrary is a violation of the Presidential oath of office to which Donald John Trump is bound. In so doing, the aforementioned Donald John Trump, unmindful of the high duties of his high office and the dignity and the proprieties thereof, and of his oath of office, to ‘‘faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States of America, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,’’ has undermined the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency, has betrayed his trust as President to the manifest injury of the people of the United States of America, and is unfit to be President. Therefore, Donald John Trump, by betraying his trust as President, warrants impeachment, trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold any office of high honor, trust, or profit under the United States of America. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FRANKS of Arizona). Under rule IX, a resolution offered from the floor by a Member other than the majority leader or the minority leader as a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence only at a time designated by the Chair within 2 legislative days after the resolution is properly noticed. Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the gentleman from Texas will appear in the RECORD at this point. The Chair will not at this point determine whether the resolution constitutes a question of privilege. That determination will be made at the time designated for consideration of the resolution. 
b1245 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S. 585, DR. CHRIS KIRKPATRICK WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT OF 2017; PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM OCTOBER 16, 2017, THROUGH OCTOBER 20, 2017; AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 562 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. R ES. 562 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (S. 585) to provide greater whistleblower protections for Federal employees, increased awareness of Federal whistleblower protections, and increased accountability and required discipline for Federal supervisors who retaliate against whistleblowers, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; and (2) one motion to recommit. SEC. 2. On any legislative day during the period from October 16, 2017, through October 20, 2017— (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day shall be considered as approved; and (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4, section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by the Chair in declaring the adjournment. SEC. 3. The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a) of rule I. SEC. 4. It shall be in order at any time on the legislative day of October 12, 2017, or October 13, 2017, for the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this section. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on House Resolution 562, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule forward on behalf of the Rules Committee. Yesterday, the Rules Committee heard testimony from our colleagues, Congressman PAUL MITCHELL , Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member ELIJAH CUMMINGS , and Congresswoman A NN KUSTER . 
This rule provides for the consideration of S. 585, the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and provides for a motion to recommit. S. 585 was authored by Senator JOHNSONin the Senate, and the House companion was introduced by my friend, Congressman SEAN DUFFY . I want to thank my colleagues from Wisconsin for their leadership on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, this bill addresses a problem that is, unfortunately, far too common. When Federal employees blow the whistle on questionable practices, they face risk of retaliation and intimidation from their own employers, even though the current Federal law is supposed to protect them. In fact, the underlying legislation provided for by this rule is named after an individual who ultimately took his own life after he became the victim of retaliation related to his whistleblowing. Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick was a Department of Veterans Affairs doctor who raised concerns that the VA might be overmedicating patients. A later VA investigation found that Dr. Kirkpatrick’s concerns were warranted, but it was too late. Dr. Kirkpatrick had already suffered retribution from within the VA and was eventually dismissed from the agency. On the day of his termination, Dr. Kirkpatrick took his own life. Dr. Kirkpatrick’s story is a tragedy, one that none of us ever wants to see repeated. The Department of Veterans Affairs has become a de facto poster child for hostility toward whistleblowers. In fact, according to the Office of Special Counsel—the agency tasked with investigation and redressing whistleblower retaliation—the OSC has seen a sharp increase in the number of whistleblower cases from VA employees. OSC Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner went on to say that: ‘‘ . . . it is clear that the workplace culture in many VA facilities is hostile to whistleblowers and actively discourages them from coming forward with what is often critical information.’’ This disturbing trend may be most visible at the VA, but the problem of backlash against whistleblowers persists across the Federal Government. Let me make something clear. There are good actors and bad actors within each agency. There are good actors who shine light on the legitimate concerns in order to help their colleagues and the American people. There are also good actors who listen to those concerns and address them with integrity, and treat whistleblowers with respect. Unfortunately, there are also bad actors. These are the ones that this legislation seeks to address, and the problem they create is the one that the underlying bill works to solve. The underlying legislation provides for better training for Federal employees so that they understand Federal whistleblower protections. It also sets minimum disciplinary standards across all agencies for retaliation against whistleblowers while increasing protections for people who have the courage to speak up when they discover a problem. The bill specifically requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to determine a plan to restrict unauthorized employee access to medical files, which—and it disturbs me to say this— has been used as a method of retaliation against whistleblowers. This legislation would make much needed changes to ensure that those who come forward with information necessary to maintain and increase accountability within our government do not suffer backlash as well. Importantly, the bill also helps these individuals to know their rights and what protections and recourse are available to them. It is unfortunate that we need this legislation, but evidence has indicated that we do. The underlying legislation puts bullies who have made their nest in government agencies on notice that their behavior won’t stand. It defends brave whistleblowers and puts the bad actor Federal employees on notice: hostile work environments that target whistleblowers are on the bureaucracy’s endangered species list. The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act also builds on the work the current administration is doing to address retribution levied against whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Importantly, I have colleagues on both sides of the aisle who agree that we need to address this problem and that the time to do so is now. The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent on May 25, 2017. We need to continue their good work here today. On behalf of the whistleblowers who have risked their careers and safety to right wrongs in our government, we need to support this strong and timely legislation. Calling for attention and action to address improper behavior within the United States Government should not be considered a risky undertaking. Many Federal employees work day in and day out on behalf of the American people, yet some feel threatened when they try in earnest to make things better. We need to continue the Senate’s work on behalf of these individuals and the Americans that they serve. Everyone deserves a government that is accountable for its own decisions and for the actions of its agents. Today we have a chance to make strides towards a more accountable government. We have the opportunity to address the most pressing problems facing whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs and across the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. As my colleague noted, Dr. Kirkpatrick was a psychologist at a VA medical center in Wisconsin. In 2009, he was fired from his job after allegedly questioning the overmedication of his patients, particularly related to opioids. Tragically, that very same day, Dr. Kirkpatrick committed suicide. I think we can all agree that protecting whistleblowers helps to ensure that waste, fraud, and abuse in our government does not go unnoticed or ignored. It is our responsibility to empower and encourage whistleblowers to come forward and speak out when something isn’t right. No one should have to live in fear of retaliation for bringing the truth to light. No one should fear losing their job or career or their life simply for following the rules. The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act increases accountability by enacting mandatory punishments for any manager or superior at an agency who has been found to have retaliated against a whistleblower. The bill also contains VAspecific reforms to better protect the privacy of medical records. Employee medical records would now be prohibited from being accessed in the case of potential retaliation cases, which adds an additional level of accountability for supervisors; and protecting the whistleblower from attacks and threats based on their personal medical history, which would be completely inappropriate. Mr. Speaker, while there are strong and necessary reforms in this bill, I want to make sure that you know that legislation can always be improved through the amendment process or at least through conducting a hearing and markup of a bill. Sadly, but unsurprisingly in this Congress, this bill didn’t have a markup in committee; didn’t have a hearing; is considered under a closed rule, where amendments that were brought forward aren’t even allowed to be debated on the House floor. This might be a surprise even to the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, who himself requested a structured rule that allowed for debate on amendments. Much of my statement today echoes the sentiment of Oversight and Government Reform Ranking Member CUMMINGS and his testimony yesterday evening in the Rules Committee. Though this bill isn’t perfect, it can be improved and strengthened by a few relatively straightforward amendments, which, unfortunately, were shut 
down in the Rules Committee last night. The first amendment, which was blocked today, would have addressed the bill’s constitutional concerns first raised by the Office of Personnel Management by revising the mandatory disciplinary procedures to allow superiors their constitutional rights to due process in responding to accusations of retaliation. It would have improved the bill and made it more likely to stand up in court to challenge. An amendment reaffirming the right to due process would have been something at least worth voting on, and, in fact, could have preserved the constitutionality of the core elements of this bill, ensuring that it stays in place to protect whistleblowers. Another amendment blocked under this rule would have addressed privacy concerns contained in the bill. Specifically, the amendment would have protected the privacy of a whistleblower who commits suicide, by requiring the permission of the whistleblower’s next of kin before an agency can share information regarding the suicide. Again, it seems like a straightforward fix to protect the privacy of whistleblowers and their families. At the very least, even if Members of this body disagreed with it, why didn’t we at least bring it forward for debate and a vote? Another amendment that was blocked today contained the text of Mr. CUMMINGS ’ bill, H.R. 702, which was passed by the House of Representatives unanimously. As you know, this bill would expand protections for employees who face discrimination, and it solidifies our commitment to protecting whistleblowers and other employees from retaliation. It was a bipartisan bill. It passed the House unanimously. We simply should have allowed it under this bill to become part of a related effort. Now, I know that my colleagues on the other side will say: Oh, the Senate is slow. They won’t take up this bill on time. It is better for us to pass something now than have to wait for their approval. But it only takes 10 minutes usually to debate an amendment. So we could have allowed three amendments and spent no more than 30 minutes debating them and still reported this bill out expeditiously. Now, I happen to think that, while there are many on the other side of the aisle who would agree the House needs to return to regular order, it is time that Members actually started by voting according to what they are saying. By voting ‘‘no’’ on this rule and rejecting it, we can send the message to House leadership that we want an open, regular order process. Bills should come out of committee through markups. Republicans and Democrats should have the opportunity to amend bills on the floor of the House. Perhaps if we did that more often, the Senate would not simply cast aside many of the bills that have passed the House, knowing that they went through the process of deliberate consideration by our body, rather than a bill that appears fully formed where Members of this body simply get an up ordown vote. This bill will enjoy bipartisan support when it passes the House later today, as it should, but it also begs the question of: Why are we spending valuable time debating a noncontroversial bill, especially if it is considered under a closed rule? Why not have simply put it up on suspension in the first place? To say things bluntly, we are actually running out of time this year. By my count, we only have 30 legislative days left in the first half of the 115th Congress, yet we are faced with so many important issues we need to move forward on. Nine million children face losing their health insurance because Congress has not yet acted to reauthorize CHIP. Almost 1 million young, aspiring Americans have no idea what their lives will look like 6 months from now because of the President’s decision to end DACA and Congress’s continued inability to make it permanent law. The citizens of Puerto Rico, American citizens, still have not been granted a Federal aid package and are suffering from a lack of food, clean water, healthcare supplies, and electricity, jeopardizing many of their lives today. Yet here we are debating a bill without even allowing an amendment process that we could have passed under suspension vote yesterday so we could move on to CHIP, to Puerto Rico, to DACA today, rather than spend one of our 30 remaining days of business this year avoiding the topics that the American people want us to take on. Despite the important goals we have left to accomplish this year, it is misleading to assume that regular order isn’t feasible. We have all seen how fast Congress can work when we are pushed right up to the edge. It is past time that we show that same urgency and commitment in considering legislation under regular order, even if it means we have to stay here on Thursdays and Fridays, even if it means we are working until 8 or 9 or 10 or midnight. The American people deserve no less. Make no mistake, the Whistleblower Protection Act is an important piece of legislation that will help protect whistleblowers and hold Federal agencies accountable, but if we are going to devote this much time to legislation that protects employees, let’s take it a step further and talk about expanding worker protections for an even greater number of Americans. For example, my legislation, the Giving Workers a Fair Shot Act—which I introduced last session and this session, and has yet to receive a hearing, no less a markup in the Education and Workforce Committee—would protect workers from wage theft, prevent taxpayer funds from going towards union busting, and establish first contract arbitration to prevent companies from dragging on labor negotiations unnecessarily to the detriment of workers. b1300 We don’t have time to waste. If we are going to consider an issue, let’s dive in. We can protect whistleblowers from retaliation and strengthen the rights of workers at the same time. Given the minimal amount of time we have left to work with, 30 days this year, we have an obligation to do both. By the way, the fact that we only work 30 more days this year here in the United States Congress probably comes as a great surprise to many hardworking Americans who are accustomed to working 5 days a week. We have the rest of the month of October, November, December. Well, many Americans might get Christmas Day off, perhaps even Christmas Eve, but I don’t think Americans realize that Congress is only going to work 30 days out of the next 78 days. That is less than a halftime job, Mr. Speaker. I think the American people deserve more from us in this body, especially when so many issues like CHIP, like DACA, like Puerto Rico, and many others have gone unanswered by us in this body, the House of Representatives, or by colleagues across the way in the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY). Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill, S. 585, the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. This bill strengthens penalties against those who retaliate against whistleblowers, adds protections and opportunities for whistleblowers placed on probation, and ensures Federal employees have a greater knowledge of whistleblower rights and protections. Specifically, this bill forbids a supervisor from taking or threatening to take action against an employee because they refuse to obey an order that would violate a law, rule, or regulation. I want to thank Senator RONJOHNSONfor his persistence in pushing this legislation even after the former Senator Harry Reid shut it down last Congress. What a poignant and meaningful gesture to name this bill after Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick, a VA employee who took his own life after being subjected to cruel retaliation from VA officials. I hope it puts in perspective the immense emotional burdens that victims of retaliation face. Mr. Speaker, this issue is personal for me. Unfortunately, I have seen exactly what retaliation against whistleblowers looks like, how easy it is to get 
away with it, and why we have to put a stop to it. Last week marked the 3year anniversary since the director of the central Alabama VA became the first senior manager in the country fired as a result of the waitlist scandal. That was a major step towards turning around one of the Nation’s worst VA systems and restoring trust with the veteran population it serves. Mr. Speaker, I can say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it would have never happened without brave whistleblowers inside the VA telling me the truth. Two brave individuals in particular, Sheila Meuse and Rich Tremaine, told me the truth about major instances of misconduct and mismanagement when no one else would. Seeing no other way to achieve change, they finally told their story to the media, at great personal risk to their careers. The stories that emerged from these exposures were almost unbelievable: More than 1,000 Xray cancer screenings were lost and unread for years, even though some showed malignancies. When alerted to the problem, top administrators tried to cover this up. A pulmonologist manipulated more than 1,200 patient records but, even after being caught twice, was still given a satisfactory review. A central Alabama VA employee took a recovering veteran to a crack house and bought him drugs and prostitutes in order to extort his VA payments. Even when caught, this employee was not fired until a year and a half later when we exposed it in the newspaper. Mr. Speaker, this behavior is egregious, and, trust me, there is a lot more where it came from. However, had it not been for the courage of those on the inside to expose this wrongdoing, the world might not have ever known. To me and to the veterans whose lives they might have saved, they are heroes. But that is not how they were treated by VA officials. They were treated as enemies and outcasts, all because they tried to do the right thing. Rich Tremaine actually testified here before the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, detailing the systemic way that some VA officials attempted to silence and marginalize him. The effects of him blowing the whistle on wrongdoing follow him to this day, far away from Montgomery, Alabama. Mr. Speaker, my experience working to clean house at the VA taught me a fascinating and frustrating truth about the culture in some parts of the VA. The system routinely goes out of its way to protect those who don’t do their jobs or even harm veterans, but then goes after those who try to stop that misbehavior. For years, because of poorly written civil service laws and powerful unions, too many VA employees got the message that misconduct, negligence, and poor performance would be tolerated, but blowing the whistle on that kind of behavior would not be. I have seen it too many times. All too frequently, VA employees caught for doing the wrong thing are reprimanded, shuffled around to different jobs, or allowed to quietly retire, but those who try to do the right thing by our veterans by shining a light on misconduct are persecuted, intimidated, or worse. While I am proud of the work that we have done for the last 3 years to put an end to this unacceptable culture at the VA, there is much work left to be done. Mr. Speaker, there is a reason why Federal employees face retaliation for speaking up. It is not because people are just naturally mean or because there is some kind of misunderstanding. The reason whistleblowers face systemic retaliation is because it works. When a brave whistleblower faces intimidation or persecution for their action, every other employee sees it, and they know what will happen to them if they tell the truth. It has a powerful, chilling effect—one we saw firsthand in Montgomery. They retaliate because it works. That is just wrong, and it is time to punish those who do it with harsher penalties. We need to rethink our civil service laws in this country to make sure public servants live up to the honor and responsibility of the public trust, and I believe that this bill is another positive step in that direction. Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to bring it to the floor by supporting this rule. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, President Trump has been relentless on his attack on immigrant Americans, generally, and, in particular, DREAMers since he took office. Yet 82 percent of American voters, including about 70 percent of Republicans, believe DREAMers should be allowed to stay in the U.S. and apply for citizenship. Yet President Trump has continued to turn his back on these innocent young people. Mr. Speaker, here is our chance to rectify President Trump’s decision and restore the American people’s faith in us and our faith in our aspiring Americans. When we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help thousands of young people who are de facto Americans in every way except for on paper. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, by defeating the previous question today, we can bring forward the Dream Act, which I am confident would pass on the floor of the House probably by a good margin. What the Dream Act does is it allows young people who grew up in our country, who know no other country, a pathway to become citizens. They have gone to our schools, they have been on the football team or cheerleaders like your own kids or grandkids, Mr. Speaker. They are able to work legally in our country because of the deferred action program, which is scheduled by President Trump to be canceled in 41⁄2 months. We need to act now to give these young people the certainty they need to live their lives as Americans, the only country they know, and the only country that they are loyal to. We simply don’t have time to waste. We need to give these young de facto Americans the certainty they need to continue with their lives to be able to contribute to our country, join our military, pay taxes, and all of the other responsibilities that Americans have. Of course, Mr. Speaker, protecting whistleblowers is important. It is critical to ensure that our democracy functions honestly and with accountability and government is truly working in the best interests of the people that it serves. But we could get there a better way, by having an open process that allows Democrats and Republicans to suggest further improvements to whistleblower protection rather than having a bill that was never marked up in committee, that simply appeared fully formed for the full House to consider without the opportunity for Democrats or Republicans to make it any better. The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act will strengthen the rights of whistleblowers and reaffirm their value and importance to our country. But once again, this bill should have gone through a regular process that allowed us to amend it. The fact that this bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support shouldn’t stop us from making changes in this body, the House of Representatives, to improve the bill and make it work even better. We have an obligation to our constituents to thoughtfully consider every piece of legislation in front of us and to amend where we see fit. As we move forward on addressing the pressing issues in front of us, such as finding a path forward on deferred action, which we will present if we can defeat the previous question, reauthorizing CHIP, or making improvements in our healthcare system, let’s do it through a regular process that allows Democrats and Republicans, the 435 of us who serve here, to bring forward our ideas, not just the ideas of leadership in making the country a better place. We have good, smart, deliberate Members on both sides of the aisle who want to work, want to legislate. It is ridiculous that we only have 30 days out of the next 78 in which Congress 
will even be working, and I suspect for most of the 30 days, like today, Democrats and Republicans won’t even be able to offer their ideas and have them considered. The American people deserve better. We as an institution, as the United States Congress, can do better, and we can begin by defeating the previous question and defeating the rule. Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s concern, especially for the piece of legislation that is before us. I think it is a step forward and things that we should be doing and things that are the oversight role of this Congress, especially when we are dealing with the issue of whistleblowers and the value that they bring, and also the culture that seems to have pervaded. I so appreciate the gentlewoman from Alabama and her stories. We, in Georgia, have had similar issues. We had that in the Augusta medical center. We also had it in others. I think the issue here today, though, and I want to be very clear, Mr. Speaker, many times when we come to the floor, there is this discussion and it gets circulated that we are actually against all Federal employees, or that every Federal employee is bad, and that none of the Federal employees are worth their payment or whatever. That is just not true. The work of the vast majority of the VA employees, the workers of the vast majority of the agencies, although we may have philosophical differences on how big some of our agencies should be or if they should be in the role of Federal Government, at the end of the day, the value and the worth of the Federal employee is never questioned, at least by this Member. But when we find bad actors, when we find bad policies, when we find bad procedures, when we find things that inherently are wrong and they are kept wrong, as the gentlewoman from Alabama so well pointed out, that when the culture becomes protecting the bad and punishing the good, then we have an issue that has developed far beyond the scope of what it should be. These are some of the things that we are discussing today, and I think it is worth the time on this floor, it is worth the time on the Senate floor, as they have already passed this bill, and I think the concerns raised are the discussion of which has been addressed in this. I think what we look at today is today’s bill is a necessary step, but I believe toward integrity, Mr. Speaker. My colleagues and I owe it to our neighbors and to Federal employees who serve to increase whistleblower protections. We need a clear path for public servants to serve Americans with the knowledge that we will honor their good character and courage. They should not feel alone in their resolve to improve the VA or any other agency. Yet too often, we have seen the current law leave them at the mercy of bad actors. We must strengthen the existing statutes to address the litany of retaliations aimed at whistleblowers. The bill today will deter agency officials from targeting whistleblowers for shining a light on dark flaws in their organization. Bad actors are even today evading discipline while whistleblowers who strive to do what is right too often endure punishment for their brave actions. The whistleblowers are on the losing end of a system that often favors mischief, which means that the American public also suffers. This bill will bring relief to Federal truth tellers and the everyday Americans who depend on their services. We best serve the American people by protecting whistleblowers, addressing their concerns properly, and investigating their claims with transparency. b1315 The Federal Government exists to protect its citizens by holding wrongdoers accountable. It is designed to support those who work to root out wrongs in the system. The underlying legislation brings us closer to a Federal system run by the people and for the benefit of the people, not for the benefit of a few bad actors who exploit its structure. It delivers justice to both victims and bad actors, protects whistleblowers who act in good faith, and ensures that the American Government better serves the American people. At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, is that not what it is all about? At the end of the day, is it not what we as a Congress and as a House and a Senate should be about, and that is assuring that the people who we are elected to serve are best served by their own tax dollars through the agencies and processes of the Federal Government to provide basic services to our veterans, who serve in our other agencies, who, at the core of this, actually comes down—to me, this is a protection of whistleblowers. But in a bigger role, it is actually a protection of the currency that is the best that can be used in our Federal agencies, and that is the trust of the American people. When we are in the discussion of trust in the American people, right now, many times, if you look around, the Federal Government may not be in that trusted role because many times they see the actions of the bad actors as opposed to many times the very shining lights of the good actors. Those good actors who are willing to participate and to step forward and to be a part of the solution and not a part of the problem need that protection. We cannot continue to perpetuate and turn a blind eye when this is so relevant in our government. When we do this, we stand for those whom we serve. We stand, not only for the districts in which we are elected, but the American people who have taken to this institution to say: I expect my trust to be exemplified in the employees of the Federal Government and through the stewardship of their tax dollars. The question for us today is not do we continue to protect the system that is broken, but the question for us is to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this previous question, to move this rule, and to move this bill, because this is saying we value that integrity currency, we value those who are willing to step forward at risk of themselves, in courage, to say: This is wrong, we need to fix it, and let the chips fall where they may. We protect the right. We punish the wrong. That is what this bill does. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 562 O FFERED BY  MR. POLIS At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment of status of certain individuals who are long term United States residents and who entered the United States as children and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 3440. THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s 
ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2105, the NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act of 2017, a bipartisan effort to help small businesses implement the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for Critical Infrastructure. I thank Mr. WEBSTER for his work on the bill and all of my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for their support of the bill. I would also like to thank Senator SCHATZ and my colleagues in the Senate for working to pass the companion version over there, which I hope that we can follow suit on here today. 
The NIST cybersecurity framework provides valuable guidance on cybersecurity best practices for organizations of all sizes, but small businesses often don’t have the time or resources to figure out how to adapt it to their needs and implement it. This bill directs NIST to create clear guidelines, tools, and best practices specifically for small businesses so that they can protect their networked resources. Most small businesses do not have significant IT departments. Some do not even have any dedicated information security personnel. Thus, they may be more at risk of cyber attack than large enterprises. According to data released last month, 53 percent of American businesses of all sizes suffered a cyber attack in the past year. Of those, 72 percent spent more than $5,000 to investigate and recover. A 2016 report found that 42 percent of businesses suffered a cyber attack of some kind. Incidents like these do not only hurt individual smallbusiness owners, employees, and customers, they hurt American competitiveness. In my district in the southwest suburbs of Chicago, there is a fourthgeneration family manufacturing business that has suffered multiple sophisticated phishing attacks. The few times they have fallen victim to these attacks, the costs have been significant. The owners have told me that they would welcome guidance on affordable, offtheshelf resources to strengthen their cyber defenses and let them get back to focusing on their business. This is a story repeated across the country. That is why we must act, and we must pass this bill for our small businesses. The guidelines created under this bill, like the NIST framework, will be voluntary, so we won’t be adding to the regulatory burden on small businesses. Instead, we will be offering them an opportunity to secure their networks so that they can compete on a level playing field. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN). Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 2105, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Small Business Cybersecurity Act. This bipartisan legislation instructs the Director of NIST, in consultation with other Federal agencies, to disseminate guidance to help small businesses identify, assess, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risks. As a smallbusiness owner, I am honored to be a cosponsor of this bill. We know the importance of keeping all records safe and secure from outside threats. With the recent hacking of Equifax and many others, there is clearly a growing risk of online hacking and cyber warfare in the world today. It is imperative that we ensure that the backbone of our economy, our small and mediumsize businesses, have the resources they need to stay safe. I strongly believe that the businesses in Florida’s Second District would benefit from this vital information, which will help them keep their data safe and secure. By increasing cybersecurity efforts, we are protecting both small businesses and their millions of customers across the country. This bill doesn’t cost the taxpayers anything, but it could potentially save smallbusiness owners and consumers both their privacy and livelihoods. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON ), the ranking member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2105, the NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act of 2017, which directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to provide more guidance, resources, and tools to small businesses to improve their cybersecurity and protect the personal information of their customers. According to the Small Business Administration, the 28 million small businesses in America account for 54 percent of all U.S. sales and 55 percent of all U.S. jobs. Small businesses play a central role in our economy. Unfortunately, the information systems and networks of small businesses are especially vulnerable to an increasing volume and sophistication of cyber attacks. Small businesses rarely have employees or leadership with education or training in cybersecurity. Further, small businesses typically have limited resources to invest in cybersecurity. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, is a leader in developing standards and guidelines for cybersecurity in both the public and private sectors. In 2009, NIST developed a guidance document called, ‘‘Small Business Information Security: The Fundamentals.’’ The document described the fundamentals of an effective smallbusiness information security program in nontechnical language. In 2014, in response to an executive order from President Obama, NIST published the Cybersecurity Framework for Critical Infrastructure. The cybersecurity framework, as written, is most useful for larger businesses with at least some cybersecurity expertise. Therefore, in November 2016, NIST published an update of their smallbusiness guidance document using the framework as a template. These are just two examples of how NIST has long privatized supporting smallbusiness efforts to strengthen cybersecurity. The requirements of H.R. 2105 are consistent with these ongoing efforts and help ensure that they will continue. Ideally, H.R. 2105 would have also provided resources for NIST to expand these activities because the need is very clear. We cannot effectively support small business in this country unless we provide the relevant government agencies the resources to help protect those businesses from cyber threats. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2105, and I thank the sponsors, including Mr. WEBSTER , Mr. L IPINSKI , and Ms. R OSEN , for their strong support for small businesses and NIST’s important role in cybersecurity. However, I am concerned that the House bill contains an explicit unfunded mandate clause and that the Senate passed a version that is silent in funding. I hope Congress will provide NIST the adequate resources to fulfill the mandates in this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), chairman of the committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER ) for yielding me time and for introducing H.R. 2105, the NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act. This important and timely bipartisan bill, cosponsored by 17 Members of Congress and approved by the Science Committee by voice vote, directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to provide small businesses with cybersecurity guidelines, tools, best practices, standards, and methodologies necessary to better protect themselves from cyber attacks. Small businesses help produce a thriving economy that benefits our entire country. They bring innovative ideas, cuttingedge products and services, and jobs to the marketplace. In my home State, for example, there are more than 2.4 million small businesses that employ almost 4.5 million Texans. Major cyber attacks dominate news coverage, such as the Equifax or Yahoo hacks that impacted millions and billions of people. But small businesses, which often do not have sufficient information to adequately monitor and protect their computer systems, are frequently the target of cyber attacks, as well. A 2016 Symantec report notes that cyber attacks against businesses with fewer than 250 employees have grown from 18 percent in 2011 to 43 percent in 2015. This bill can help those businesses. October is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, so it is appropriate that we consider a bill designed to help protect small businesses from cybersecurity attacks. Today’s legislation provides small businesses with NIST expertise to reduce their cybersecurity risk. NIST experts developed a cybersecurity framework through collaboration between the government and the private sector. This framework is accepted and used by many private organizations to address and manage their information technology vulnerabilities in a costeffective way. 
The guidance described in this bill to help small businesses is based on the NIST cybersecurity framework. H.R. 2105 prioritizes dissemination of this guidance by NIST within its almost $1 billion budget. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to show their support for small business by approving Mr. WEBSTER ’s fiscally responsible, innovation protection bill today. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ), the chairwoman of the subcommittee. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2105. When I travel around my district, which is rich with technology workers, the thing that I hear repeated concern about is the increasing need for individuals with the skill set, education, training, and knowledge of cybersecurity matters. With the recent events with Equifax, WannaCry, and OPM breaches, it is clear that our cybersecurity infrastructure needs to be strengthened. In December 2016, the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity specifically recommended that the administration should ‘‘develop concrete efforts to support and strengthen the cybersecurity of small and mediumsized businesses.’’ With small businesses accounting for most of the U.S. economy’s jobs and sales, it is imperative that we provide guidance to help them identify, assess, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risks. By making these resources readily available to small businesses across the country, this commonsense legislation will help them protect their sensitive data and business from cyber threats so they can grow our economy and provide more jobs instead. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this measure, the NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on its passage. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER ) for his leadership on this legislation. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ). b1415 Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2105, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Small Business Cybersecurity Act. This bill directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to issue guidance for small businesses to use voluntarily to assist them in identifying and assessing, managing, and reducing the cybersecurity risk. As has been said, small businesses in the U.S. account for 54 percent of sales and 55 percent of U.S. jobs. However, a 2016 Symantec Internet Security Threat Report indicated that businesses with less than 250 employees are facing increased cybersecurity threats, up from 18 percent in 2011 to 43 percent in 2015. Mr. Speaker, I recently passed our real estate small business to my son Warren, so I understand the importance of equipping small businesses with the tools that will enable them to meet the emerging challenges. I urge passage of H.R. 2105, which will help prepare small businesses in the future, and I urge my colleagues to pass it. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ). Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Small Business Cybersecurity Act, a bill that I am proud to cosponsor. This legislation will help promote stronger cybersecurity practices amongst our Nation’s small businesses, and it is fiscally responsible. The wellbeing of our small businesses is important to the overall health of our economy. According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses account for 55 percent of total jobs in the United States. In my home State of Nebraska, small businesses employed 390,000 people in 2016. Some small businesses are not able to prioritize cybersecurity efforts over other aspects of their business or they lack the resources to secure their networks and systems. We must promote greater preparedness to protect small businesses from cyber attacks. H.R. 2105 directs NIST to disseminate guidance to help small businesses identify, assess, manage, and reduce their cyber risks based off NIST’s extensive expertise. This is a big step towards promoting better cybersecurity practices amongst our Nation’s small businesses. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2105. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we all have come down here and talked about the importance of small business. We know how important small businesses are to our country, the real engine of our economic growth. We also know that, in most small businesses today, they don’t have the capabilities to have an IT department or the expertise that they need to protect themselves from the continual cyber attacks, the theft of data that we hear about. But those attacks and that theft of data does not only happen for large companies; it is also a threat to small businesses. Therefore, we need to do all that we can to make sure that they are capable of protecting themselves so that our small businesses can continue to thrive and be the economic engine that they are. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. We get something good done for our small businesses. I urge them to support this, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank those from both sides— Ranking Member LIPINSKI , Chairman SMITH, and others—who have supported this bill. It is a great idea. It is an opportunity to not only have available for us, it has bipartisan support and also bicameral support. This is a good opportunity to help all small businesses. I know personally from my business and I know others who have small businesses who know that there is, in a sense, very little help right now for small businesses in this area of cybersecurity. The larger businesses certainly have their own IT people; we don’t. So I am excited about the fact that this could happen, and I move passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BARTON ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2105, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation introduced by Chairman KNIGHT  and Ranking Member MURPHY of the Committee on Small Business’ Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce aims to modernize and improve the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer, or SBIR and STTR, programs. The SBIR and STTR programs have helped thousands of small businesses create new technologies, commercialize their ideas, and generate new jobs. While creating these benefits in the private sector, the programs offer, in a costeffective manner, ways for Federal agencies to solve operational problems. H.R. 2763 strengthens these two programs in quite a few ways. First, the bill emphasizes agency accountability by creating several firm reporting deadlines for covered agencies and for the SBA to provide future Congresses with improved information that will lead to a better understanding of the programs’ strengths and weaknesses. Second, the legislation clarifies the congressional intent of the 2011 reauthorization to ensure that taxpayers reap the benefits of the SBIR and STTR programs by binding the technologies developed in the programs to longterm projects at the Department of Defense. Third, the legislation extends a popular pilot program included in the 2011 reauthorization that would allow all participating Federal agencies to award a phase II contract immediately if the agency finds that the small business concern has already completed work typically done during phase I. Fourth, it makes permanent the option for all participating agencies to 
establish commercialization readiness programs, or CRPs. As a pilot program from the 2011 reauthorization, these CRPs have been shown to provide muchneeded support to small companies nearing the completion of the process and have helped advance technology to the commercialization phase. Fifth, it extends, through 2022, the provision that allows participating agencies to utilize 3 percent of their allocation for administrative functions, conduct outreach in an effort to bring more companies into the SBIR and STTR programs, and increase deterrents to waste, fraud, and abuse. I want to thank Congressman KNIGHT  and Congresswoman MURPHY for the bipartisan work on this important legislation. I would also like to thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member JOHNSON of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, as well as Chairwoman COMSTOCK and Ranking Member LIPINSKI of the Subcommittee on Research and Technology, for working together with us to produce this bipartisan bill that we have before us this afternoon. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2763, The Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Improvements Act, which will modernize two programs that provide Federal funding to small technologically advanced firms to research and develop innovative products. I am proud to have cosponsored this legislation with Congressman STEVE  KNIGHT , and I am encouraged that my colleagues on the Small Business Committee and the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee on both sides of the aisle support the bill. For decades, American innovation and ingenuity have bolstered our economic growth and solidified our country’s status as a global leader in technology; and for more than 30 years, the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs have provided a critical source of funding to small businesses that engage in research and development. These initiatives were established to help spur innovation and job creation throughout the country. Since the inception of the programs, more than $40 billion has been awarded to small, innovative firms to address our Nation’s most important research and development challenges. Because of the highrisk nature of their ventures, SBIR and STTR grantees receive R&D funding that might otherwise be unavailable in the private sector. As a direct result of the Federal investment in these programs, breakthroughs have been made in a wide range of sectors, including agriculture, defense, energy, and healthcare. In turn, these discoveries have generated tremendous economic growth and job opportunities across the country, including in central Florida. For many research companies in my district, these two programs serve as a gateway to the Federal contracting field. That is why I am honored to have cosponsored this bipartisan legislation. The final bill reflects bipartisan compromises and input from both committees of jurisdiction. Most importantly, it includes many provisions focused on developing innovative products that support important national priorities and that can be sold on the commercial market. To improve oversight of the program, the bill requires the Small Business Administration to submit an annual report to Congress no later than December 31 of each year. This will enable us to better account for the use of funds and to better assess the progress of SBIR and STTR initiatives at participating agencies. Another provision makes permanent the pilot program that establishes the Civilian Agency Commercialization Readiness program, which allows up to 10 percent of agency administrative dollars for sequential phase II awards to eligible businesses. Finally, the bill includes an amendment that I authored to require participating Federal agencies to take additional steps to educate small firms about the SBIR and STTR programs and to encourage more small firms to apply for funding. After more than a decade of fits and starts with these two programs, H.R. 2763 will make program improvements and provide muchneeded certainty to small businesses seeking to commercialize. By authorizing the administrative fee to run these programs for an additional 5 years beyond its current authorization, Congress is taking proactive steps to give small firms the confidence they need to continue developing innovative products. I respectfully ask my colleagues to vote for this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce on the Small Business Committee. Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his hard work and for his leadership, and I want to thank my partner in this, Congresswoman MURPHY , for her cosponsoring of this bill and for her work on this important piece of legislation. A 21st century military requires a 21st century acquisition process, one that is agile, efficient, and effective. I represent California’s 25th District, and nowhere will you find a more exemplary place that demonstrates the important role that small businesses play in both our aerospace and defense industrial base. b1430 I see firsthand the innovative effect small businesses make and how they can positively impact government functioning. The Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer—SBIR and STTR—programs are critical to this impact. Now that these programs have been reauthorized until 2022, it is important that we continue to focus on spurring innovation. That is why I introduced H.R. 2763, the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Improvements Act of 2017. My bill reinforces agency accountability by requiring the Small Business Administration to provide Congress with better information and reasonable, hard deadlines. It clarifies congressional intent of the previous authorization to ensure that taxpayers reap the benefits of SBIR and STTR programs by tying them to longterm projects at the DOD. It also allows participating agencies to establish a new, separate commercialization assistance pilot program and extends three popular pilot programs through FY 2022, when the full program will need a full reauthorization. With the use of SBIR and STTR programs, we can increase small business participation in the defense and aerospace industry while tapping into the true potential their American innovative spirit represents. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 2763, the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Improvements Act. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE  JOHNSON ), the ranking member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 2763, the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Improvements Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman CHABOT , Ranking Member V ELA´ZQUEZ , Chairman SMITH, and all other colleagues on both committees for their work to advance this bipartisan piece to the House floor. SBIR and STTR are valuable programs that provide competitive research and development grants and contracts to innovative small businesses. Stability and continuity in the SBIR and STTR programs are important goals, which is why I supported the agreement in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act to extend the program until fiscal year 2022 at the current allocation level. In H.R. 2763, the two authorizing committees have come to agreement on a number of policy improvements and some strengthened oversight for the programs. 
The policy changes in H.R. 2763 advances sensible ways to further leverage small business R&D to help meet Federal mission needs, as well as contribute more broadly to U.S. innovation and economic growth. The bill includes continued support for early stage funding for entrepreneurial researchers, provides funding for important agency outreach and administrative activities, streamlines reporting requirements, ensures agency outreach for researchers at minorityserving institutions, and authorizes several additional activities to support implementation of the program. I am particularly pleased that the bill includes a provision to address current agency shortfalls in fostering the participation of women and minority owned firms. Fostering diversity in STEM research and innovation is an economic imperative. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we must continue to encourage such policies. H.R. 2763 is a good bill that improves the SBIR program and maximizes the benefits of federally funded small business R&D. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ). Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairmen CHABOT and S MITH and Ranking Members VELA´ZQUEZ and J OHNSON  for their leadership on this bill. The SBIR and STTR programs have helped countless innovative small businesses grow jobs through American ingenuity. This bill will make these programs work even better by providing small businesses with additional tools for bringing innovations to market. Better SBIR and STTR programs mean more successful small businesses and more jobs. I especially want to thank my colleagues for supporting inclusion of two provisions that I put forward in committee. First, the bill increases the amount of money that grant recipients are allowed to spend on business and technical services, like market research, intellectual property protection; or participation in entrepreneurial training programs, like the highly successful Innovation Corps program. This helps small businesses, especially startups, use their funds where they know they are needed most, for technical assistance, creative approaches to problem solving, and other types of guidance needed in today’s complex marketplaces. Second, this bill expands the highly successful Phase 0 Proof of Concept Partnership pilot program, which I helped create at the National Institutes of Health in a previous SBIR reauthorization. This highly successful program provides the earliest funding for researchers exploring the possibility of turning their research into a viable medical product. After just 2 years in operation, the three hubs created by the NIH program have filed 30 patent applications, negotiated 14 technology licenses, formed 7 companies, and have 70 promising technologies in the pipeline. This bill extends the Phase 0 program for another 5 years at NIH and expands it to the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the Department of Energy. In doing so, we will be giving a needed boost to more researchers who are budding entrepreneurs who will create the jobs of tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, our small businesses deserve support as they drive America’s economic growth. This bill will give innovators and entrepreneurs additional tools to drive this growth that we so desperately need. So I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ). Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her work on this small business bill. I also thank Chairmen SMITH and CHABOT and Ranking Members J OHNSON  and VELA´ZQUEZ for including my amendment to benefit minorityserving institutions in H.R. 2763. This is essential to retaining American leadership in innovation and small business development. The SBIR and STTR programs were both created to expand small business participation in the Federal research mission. One of the four objectives Congress had in mind in establishing the SBIR was to facilitate and increase the participation of minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation. My amendment requires that the participating Federal agencies in the SBIR and STTR programs conduct outreach to minorityserving institutions—MSIs—and Hispanicserving institutions and faculty conducting research at these institutions so that participation rates in Federal research and development opportunities will increase. There are many great MSIs and researchers who work at these institutions across the country. For example, California State University Stanislaus, which has a campus in my district, is a Hispanicserving institution and an MSI, and has been ranked one of the best colleges in our Nation. Our country depends on innovation of MSIs and the intellectual capital of its graduates. In the 21st century, American economic growth is going to be determined by the innovation and growth of technology and STEMfocused businesses. It is critical to the growth of our economy that minorityserving institutions and minorityowned businesses are connected to this technological ecosystem. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ). Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Reauthorizing the SBIR and STTR programs are critical to supporting our Nation’s most forwardthinking entrepreneurs and innovators. I am relieved that we are preserving the critical parts of the programs and continuing to improve upon the programs themselves. These programs have proven to be one of the most successful Federal programs for technological innovation in United States history, delivering more than 70,000 patents and valuable innovations in agriculture, defense, energy, health sciences, homeland security, space, transportation, and other fields. Through Phase I and Phase II SBIR, countless jobs have been created in the capital region of New York. It is through programs such as SBIR that our region has developed the underpinnings of support for a boom in high technology innovation and economic development. One of many examples of this is Ecovative Design located within my congressional district in Green Island, New York, which has benefitted from the SBIR program over a number of years. These efforts will allow the company to continue its work on a replacement of engineered wood resins that will be economically competitive and nontoxic. The resin system represents cost and energy savings, and is capable of leveraging existing manufacturing equipment in production today. This funding will help them deliver on the promise of this innovative technology. Gavin McIntyre, cofounder and chief scientist at Ecovative said: ‘‘We’re very excited to bring our new material technology to market and displace toxic formaldehydebased resins. The SBIR/STTR program was fundamental to how Ecovative got its start and has enabled us to continue to take risks and develop gamechanging technology.’’ While this bill is a positive step forward towards helping more small businesses, we must do more to help other small businesses develop these types of gamechanging technologies. I recognize the value of research and I will fight to see more funding for all these agencies and, in turn, more funding for the SBIR and STTR programs. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, supporting our entrepreneurs and small businesses are a top priority for both sides of the aisle. Our bill will make it easier for small firms that receive SBIR and STTR awards to bring their products to market and achieve commercial success. The SBIR and STTR programs are also critical to our economy, as they support our Nation’s job creators and ensure that our country continues to produce cuttingedge research and development. This ingenuity is what makes our country a global economic powerhouse. These programs, while successful, can be improved. The bill before us is a step in the right direction insofar as it will ensure that all Federal agencies are enhancing efforts to help more small businesses obtain SBIR and STTR funding and bring their innovative products to market. Therefore, I respectfully urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank all those who spoke on this legislation, a very bipartisan, good legislation, here this afternoon on the House floor. In closing, whether it is new software system for tracking contract payments or a new medical device to help with cancer treatments, or a new piece of technology that literally saves lives on the battlefield, the SBIR and STTR programs have consistently delivered results to Federal agencies. They are worthy programs that do what they are supposed to do, but we can always do better. This legislation improves and modernizes these programs, and I ask that all of my colleagues support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2763, the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Improvements Act of 2017. And I thank the gentleman from California, Mr. KNIGHT , for introducing this important legislation. He serves on the two Committees that share jurisdiction over the SBIR and STTR programs: the Small Business Committee, chaired by my good friend, Mr. CHABOT , and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, which I chair. Mr. KNIGHT took the lead on last year’s timely reauthorization of the SBIR and STTR programs, and he is the sponsor of H.R. 2763, which makes a number of needed policy changes to increase the programs’ efficiency and effectiveness. The SBIR program was signed into law by President Reagan in 1982, followed by the STTR program in 1992. These programs help spur economic innovation and competitiveness, and increase small business participation in federal research and development activity. SBIR and STTR award winners convert the results of taxpayersupported pioneering research into products that are critical to our economic competitiveness and national security. Recent examples include parts for NASA’s Mars Rover and a unique cockpit airbag system to protect Army helicopter pilots. Today 11 federal agencies provide funding to small businesses through SBIR, and five agencies provide funding through STTR—a total of nearly $3 billion this fiscal year. That’s more than 66 times greater than the $45 million spent under the original program in 1983. Recipients of SBIR and STTR funding have boosted scientific and technological innovation and created hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Several large, international companies like Qualcomm, Sonicare and Symantec can trace their initial growth to when they were small businesses that received SBIR and STTR support. I want to call attention to two provisions of H.R. 2763 that were added by Members of the Science Committee. A provision authored by Mr. HULTGREN re quires participating federal agencies to give priority to SBIR and STTR projects that will strengthen American manufacturing innovation and increase manufacturing jobs in our country. A provision authored by Mr. HIGGINS re quires federal agencies engaged in cyber security research to give priority to SBIR and STTR projects that will spur advances in cyber security to protect the American people from increasingly aggressive and malicious cyber attacks. The legislation before us addresses a number of red flags raised by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) about lax administration of the SBIR and STTR programs. Several participating agencies do not produce accurate, timely information that Congress requires to evaluate program performance. The U.S. Small Business Administration has not submitted its required, comprehensive annual report to Congress since 2013. The last administration provided virtually no information to Congress and taxpayers about the SBIR and STTR programs. It’s reassuring that SBA associate administrator Joseph Shepard promised during a joint hearing of our Committee and the Small Business Committee that annual reports will be submitted on time. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2763 was unanimously approved by both the House Small Business Committee and the House Science Committee. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2763, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1445 POWER AND SECURITY SYSTEMS (PASS) ACT Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 190) to provide for consideration of the extension under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of nonapplication of NoLoad Mode energy efficiency standards to certain security or life safety alarms or surveillance systems, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 190 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Power And Security Systems (PASS) Act’’. 
SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF NONAPPLICATION OF NO LOAD MODE ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARD TO CERTAIN SECURITY OR LIFE SAFETY ALARM OR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS. 
(a) Section 325(u)(3)(D)(ii) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(u)(3)(D)(ii)) is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘2015’’ each place it appears and inserting ‘‘2021’’; and (2) by striking ‘‘2017’’ and inserting ‘‘2023’’. (b) Section 325(u)(3)(E) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(u)(3)(E)) is amended— (1) in clause (ii), by striking ‘‘July 1, 2017,’’ and inserting ‘‘the effective date of the amendment under subparagraph (D)(ii)’’; and (2) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(iv) TREATMENT IN RULE .—In the rule under subparagraph (D)(ii) and subsequent amendments the Secretary may treat some or all external power supplies designed to be connected to a security or life safety alarm or surveillance system as a separate product class or may extend the nonapplication under clause (ii).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RUSH) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 190. External power supplies are used for all sorts of devices, and we have learned from experience that the Federal energy efficiency standards sometimes don’t work in the ways we want them to. In particular, we need an exemption from these rules for the security and life safety alarms and surveillance alarms. S. 190, the Power and Security Systems, or PASS, Act, provides targeted exemptions that allow these critical uses to stay on the market. Devices like home security alarms or fire detection need to be on 24/7, 365, but the 2007 energy law on energy efficiency standards for external power supplies does not allow for this. Since then, Congress has created exemptions for these ‘‘always on’’ devices, but this exemption ended on July 1 of 2017. S. 190 extends this exemption out to 2023. 
The result of this bill would be that these important security systems will continue to be available, preserving the jobs of those who make them, and, most importantly, the safety of those who use them. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 190, the Power and Security Systems, or PASS, Act. Mr. Speaker, this bill would provide a noncontroversial technical fix to a Department of Energy efficiency standard, and it has widespread bipartisan support. I would also like to acknowledge my colleagues, Mr. WELCH from Vermont, Mr. BROOKS from Alabama, as well as Senator GARDNER and Senator C ANTWELL , for their work in sponsoring this bill and getting it to the floor here today. Mr. Speaker, this legislation would simply amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Department of Energy to issue a rule by July 1, 2021, which would determine whether energy conservation standards for external power supplies should be amended. The rule must contain any amendment standards and would apply to products manufactured on or after July 1, 2023. Mr. Speaker, current law exempts external power supplies for security or life safety systems from energy conservation standards until July 1, 2017. This bill simply extends that exemption to July 1, 2023. Mr. Speaker, this clarification is necessary in order to exclude power supply circuits, drivers, and devices that are designed to power security alarms, lifesaving devices, and surveillance systems. Mr. Speaker, as I stated, this legislative fix has widespread support from both houses of Congress, from both sides of the aisle, as well as from industry and the energy efficiency community. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this valuable piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I close with a short and sweet: good bill, vote for it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 190. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. NATIONAL CLINICAL CARE COMMISSION ACT Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 920) to establish a National Clinical Care Commission. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 920 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RUSH) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the RECORD . 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 920, the National Clinical Care Commission Act, a bipartisan bill that has received unanimous support within both the House and the Senate Chambers. S. 920 is the Senate companion to my bill, H.R. 309, which is cosponsored by over half of my House colleagues. It has this level of support because our Nation faces an epidemic. Diabetes or prediabetes affects over 100 million Americans. Nearly one in three of our neighbors is affected. This legislation will also help many others who are affected by other diseases like heart disease, obesity, and many others. When I first came to Congress in 2009, it was crystal clear that we had a big problem. The benefits of all the Federal research dollars going into these diseases were simply not making their way to patients. Researchers at the NIH, the CDC, the DOD, the VA, and the FDA weren’t sharing diabetes research. Who knows? Sharing information may have put us on a path to cure diabetes. It was clear then, and it is still clear today: we need a laserlike approach to improve patient care by pursuing a strong Federal focus on research. This bill accomplishes that goal by creating a National Clinical Care Commission comprised of doctors who specialize in diabetes care for patients. This commission will have 3 years to strengthen the partnership between Federal stakeholders and health professionals who will bring handson, clinical experience to improve care. This is not a new, unending bureaucracy. After 3 years, this commission will sunset. In 3 years, it will be gone. We have already made such a huge investment of taxpayer dollars into research. It is time to leverage that investment into meaningful prevention and effective treatment options. President Reagan once said: ‘‘There is no limit to the amount of good you can do if you don’t care who gets the credit.’’ That is why I stand here today in strong support of my bill, which became Senator SHAHEEN ’s bill, because this bill will help so many Americans who are suffering from diabetes. So today I ask my colleagues to again help all those who suffer from diabetes and other complex metabolic and autoimmune disorders by voting for S. 920. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 920, the National Clinical Care Commission Act. Mr. Speaker, this legislation aims to help improve Federal efforts to treat and to prevent metabolic and autoimmune disorders related to insulin. The most common metabolic disorder in the U.S. is diabetes, which affects more than 25 million Americans. Another 86 million Americans have prediabetes, a condition associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Mr. Speaker, diabetes takes a huge toll on human health; in fact, it is the seventh leading cause of death in our Nation. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, all too often diabetes leads to avoidable complications, such as blindness, such as limb amputation, and also kidney failure. In addition to the effects on human health, Mr. Speaker, diabetes care makes up a large percentage of U.S. healthcare expenditure. Mr. Speaker, currently $1 of every $5 of healthcare cost is spent caring for people with diabetes. The proportion of Medicare funding is even greater than this. Currently, $1 of every $3 of Medicare expenditure is spent caring for people with diabetes. b1500 Mr. Speaker, that is why it is important to improve the Federal efforts that prevent avoidable cases of diabetes and other metabolic disorders, and to ensure that all Americans have the treatment and the management services necessary to successfully manage this and other similar conditions. Mr. Speaker, this legislation was previously passed in the 114th Congress and again at the beginning of the 115th Congress. I am pleased to see that the Senate took action on this legislation to support passage of this bill into law. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on S. 920, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of S. 920, the National Clinical Care Commission Act, sponsored by Senator SHAHEEN . This legislation has been around for a while. It has been championed in the House by our good friend and fellow Texan, Representative PETEOLSON , as H.R. 309. This bill has strong bipartisan support. It passed this House unanimously earlier this year. Diabetes and other endocrine disorders have been a great cost burden on Medicare and, in fact, our Nation’s healthcare system in general. Thirty million Americans have diabetes, 84 million Americans have prediabetes, and three out of four Americans on Medicare have diabetes or prediabetes. And $1 out of every $3 Medicare spends is spent on diabetes. This bill will establish a clinical care commission to evaluate and recommend solutions for better coordination and use of Federal programs aimed at improving care for people with diabetes and other related endocrine disorders. This commission will be tasked with identifying gaps where new approaches are needed, eliminating duplication across Federal agencies, and leveraging the Federal resources and tools available to enhance the quality of patient care. I am confident their work will improve the lives of tens of millions of Americans living with diabetes and with other endocrine disorders while beginning the process of reducing the staggering impact of these diseases. Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to thank and commend our colleague, Representative PETEOLSON , for spearheading this important initiative. I want to thank him for bringing it to the floor of the House as many times as he has. This has been a lengthy process, but today, with the passage of this bill, we are voting on final passage, and this bill will be sent to the President’s desk for signature. Mr. Speaker, Mr. OLSON ’s long and arduous journey now will be completed with the passage of this bill, and we should all look forward to that. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. LOEBSACK ). Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. RUSH) for yielding time to me today to speak on this important bill. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong support of S. 920, the National Clinical Care Commission Act. S. 920, as was mentioned already, creates a commission comprised of clinical endocrinologists, other physician specialists, primary care physicians, healthcare professionals, patients, and representatives from the Federal agencies most involved in diabetes care. The commission is charged with making recommendations to streamline Federal investments in diabetes, to improve the coordination and clinical care outcomes for people with diabetes, prediabetes, and other insulin related metabolic and autoimmune diseases. Passage of this legislation will help the Nation undertake more and innovative approaches to diabetes and its disease complications, for which the United States spends some $322 billion annually. I urge the Secretary also to move expeditiously to set up the commission so it can begin its important work as soon as possible. Clinical training and expertise in diabetes and other insulinrelated diseases will be needed to lead the commission, and it is my hope that a clinical endocrinologist will be chosen to serve as the chairperson of the commission. I think that is very important. With a clinical endocrinologist as chair and representatives from other medical specialities, healthcare professions, and patient advocacy groups, serving alongside with Federal diabetes experts, the commission created under S. 920 will help to ensure that new innovative medications and devices are 
effectively translated to the clinical setting for the benefit of patients. That clinical translation is so important. The work of the commission will help improve the lives of the tens of millions of Americans living with diabetes while simultaneously beginning the process of reducing the staggering impact of diabetes and its disease complications and the dollars that, as has already been mentioned, are associated with that. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank in particular Representative OLSON for his persistence, as was already mentioned, and for sponsoring this bill in the House. I was very happy to lead the way as the Democrat on this side of the aisle on this bill, and for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who supported this bill that enabled House passage of the legislation earlier, as was mentioned, and now we are finally going to get it over the finish line. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative OLSON  in particular for his efforts on this. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Iowa for those kind words, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, again, short and sweet. This is a good bill. It is the first step towards actually funding a cure for diabetes. Maybe we will do that. By the way, it leaves here and will be signed into law before this week ends. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘aye’’ when this vote comes up for a final passage vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 920. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DR. JOHN F. NASH, JR. POST OFFICE Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2302) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 259 Nassau Street, Suite 2 in Princeton, New Jersey, as the ‘‘Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2302 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DR. JOHN F. NASH, JR. POST OFFICE. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 259 Nassau Street, Suite 2 in Princeton, New Jersey, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. Post Office’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. Post Office’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 2302, introduced by the gentlewoman, Congresswoman BONNIE WATSONCOLEMAN from New Jersey. The bill designates the post office located at 259 Nassau Street, Suite 2, in Princeton, New Jersey, as the Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. Post Office. John Nash was a brilliant mathematician, publishing groundbreaking work in many areas. One of his most famous contributions was to the field of game theory, creating what is known as the Nash equilibrium. For his achievements, he won a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994, and the Abel Prize from the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 2015. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to hearing more about Dr. Nash’s life from the gentlewoman from New Jersey, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I do rise to urge support for my bill, H.R. 2302, which would designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 259 Nassau Street in Princeton, New Jersey, as the Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. Post Office. As a legendary figure of Princeton University’s mathematics department, Dr. Nash was famous both for his genius and his life story. Born in Bluefield, West Virginia, in 1928, Dr. John Nash was a child prodigy who graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology at age 19, with both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in mathematics. Dr. Nash subsequently received his doctorate in 1950 from Princeton University and published a groundbreaking theory of noncooperative games later that year, which is now known as the Nash equilibrium. His monumental work in mathematics, game theory, economics, and evolutionary biology has influenced generations of experts in these fields. In addition to his academic contributions, Dr. Nash gained worldwide acclaim from the 2001 film ‘‘A Beautiful Mind,’’ which portrayed his vast accomplishments while living with schizophrenia and throughout his recovery from mental illness. In recognition of his lifelong work, Dr. Nash was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994, and the 2015 Abel Prize from the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. Tragically, he and his wife, Alicia, were killed in an automobile accident in 2015 on their return from receiving the award in Norway. Finally, I want to end my remarks by congratulating Ms. Lyla Malloy, the student in my district whose essay submission to our post office naming competition was chosen out of 84 entries. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 2302 in recognition of Dr. Nash’s important contributions to our country, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2302. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
BONUSES FOR COSTCUTTERS ACT OF 2017 Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 378) to amend title 5, United States Code, to enhance the authority under which Federal agencies may pay cash awards to employees for making cost saving disclosures, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 378 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bonuses for CostCutters Act of 2017’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. b1515 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 378, introduced by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN ), the Bonuses for CostCutters Act of 2017. The people in the best position to identify waste throughout the Federal Government are the employees on the front lines at the Federal agencies. They are the ones on the ground who know when agencies waste money. It is in the taxpayers’ best interest to encourage Federal employees to report waste when they see it. H.R. 378 increases the incentive for Federal employees to report wasteful spending by authorizing a reward of up to $20,000 for blowing the whistle on waste. This incentive is especially necessary at the end of the fiscal year when too many agencies adopt a ‘‘use it or lose it’’ mentality regarding their budgets. Some agencies fear that if they do not spend every last dollar in their budget, that Congress will somehow decrease their future funding. That dynamic leads to the most outrageous expenditures in the last week before the end of the fiscal year on September 30. Under the structure put in place by H.R. 378, agency leadership will also be able to verify that spending identified by whistleblowers is actually wasteful. This was a concern raised by our colleagues in the minority. We are thankful for their constructive work in getting this bill to a mutually agreeable compromise. The bill also maintains Congress’ constitutional role in the appropriations process. As we know, Congress is responsible for authorizing spending by the Federal Government, and this bill is careful to respect that authority. After the agency’s chief financial officer affirms that the spending in question is indeed wasteful, the agency must submit a report to the President. The President may then submit a recommendation to Congress to eliminate the wasteful spending in question. H.R. 378 is the result of a bipartisan process, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill as an example of what we can achieve when both sides put their minds to reform and husband the taxpayers’ dollars. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 378, the Bonuses for CostCutters Act, as reported by the committee. This legislation enhances the existing award program for Federal employees whose identification of waste, fraud, and abuse results in cost savings to an agency. Every day, Federal employees across the country provide vital services to the American people. They ensure that our veterans receive the benefits to which they are entitled. They work to keep our air safe to breathe and our water safe to drink. They spend long hours and put their lives at risk to safeguard our national and homeland security. And Federal employees are on the front lines in ensuring that these important missions are carried out as effectively and efficiently as possible. I think we can all agree that no one benefits when taxpayer dollars are wasted. This bill aims to increase government efficiency and save taxpayer dollars by providing incentives to Federal employees to identify wasteful spending. The legislation allows an agency head to award an employee a bonus for the identification of wasteful expenses that result in agency cost savings. The bill also doubles the amount that an inspector general may award an employee for disclosures of waste, fraud, and abuse that result in cost savings from $10,000 to $20,000. In addition, the bill contains several accountability measures so that Congress and the American people can determine whether the legislation is working as intended. First, agencies must include information on disclosures of wasteful spending and awards distributed under this legislation in their annual, publicly available, performance report. The bill also includes a requirement that the director of the Office of Management and Budget submit a report to Congress each year certifying that each agency’s cash award program complies with the bill. In addition, the bill requires a GAO report on the operation of awards program within 3 years, including any recommendations for legislative changes. Democratic members of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee raised concerns about prior versions of this bill, and I want to thank Chairman GOWDY for working with us to address those concerns. The bill we have before us today reflects bipartisan concerns. We must support Federal employees who identify ways to increase efficiency and reduce waste. I believe this bill does that, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN ), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Bonuses 
for CostCutters Act of 2017. I wish to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia. Mr. Speaker, what we see today in my bill is what I think the American people want, Republicans and Democrats working together with good, commonsense legislation that makes sense and saves the American taxpayer’s money. Let’s face it: whether we are a family or a business, we have to manage our money in the private sector; and the Federal Government, for far too long, has been guilty of spending waste, fraud, and abuse. There have been so many problems, and the American people know it. When we go home and we talk with our constituents, they want us to be very good stewards of their money, and they deserve that. That is exactly what this bill does, and it does it in a way that does a lot of different things that I think is great. First of all, as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have said, it incentivizes Federal employees to detect waste. We all know that government has a tendency, when they have a pool of money, to spend it, whether they need it or not. So if a Federal employee can go in there, find this problem out, tell the agency head, he or she now can get up to $20,000 of incentive pay. So we have incentivized fiscal responsibility in the Federal Government. That is great, and that is just good government. In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, we look at the United States Constitution, and that is a document that our Founding Fathers gave us and is so important. Why is that so important with this bill? Because when that agency head goes to the President of the United States with this recommendation, the President of the United States has to come where? Back to the Congress, where he should have to come. When Congress looks at that recommendation from the President, Congress then can make the final determination. So we have fiscal responsibility, we have constitutional sanctity, and we have good government. Most of all, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We have Republicans and Democrats working together, the way the American people want us to do, to be fiscally responsible. Mr. Speaker, I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this good government bill. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 378, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
RECIPIENTS OF WHISTLEBLOWER DISCLOSURES Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2196) to amend title 5, United States Code, to allow whistleblowers to disclose information to certain recipients, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2196 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Section 2302(b)(8)(B) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by striking ‘‘or to the Inspector’’ and all that follows through ‘‘such disclosures’’ and inserting ‘‘the Inspector General of an agency, a supervisor in the employee’s direct chain of command and up to and including the head of the employing agency, or to an employee designated by any of the aforementioned individuals for the purpose of receiving such disclosures’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 2196, a bill I introduced with Ranking Member CUMMINGS , Mr. LYNCH , and Mr. F ARENTHOLD from Texas earlier this year to allow whistleblowers to disclose information to certain recipients. Whistleblowers in the Federal Government should be able to tell their supervisors when something is wrong. That is true no matter what, but especially so in cases involving classified information, which implies a matter of national security. If whistleblowers cannot make a protected disclosure to their supervisors, they are more likely to make an illegal disclosure to people or entities without the proper security clearances. Under current law, whistleblowers in the intelligence community can make protected disclosures to their supervisors. However, whistleblowers dealing with classified information outside the intelligence community do not have that same protection. Federal employees inside the intelligence community can blow the whistle to their supervisors, to the appropriate inspector general, and to Congress. Employees outside the intelligence community do not have those protections when it comes to classified information, and they have fewer options when it comes to blowing the whistle, except to put it in the hands of those who have no clearances. Federal employees outside the intelligence community must be reassured that they can report wrongdoing to the appropriate people, including their supervisors. With this protection, whistleblowers will be less likely to disclose potentially sensitive information on waste, fraud, and abuse to the media, or other entities or individuals without the proper security clearance. This bill allows whistleblowers to make protected disclosures of classified information to individuals within their chain of command. There are very few conceivable circumstances in which a whistleblower complaint to a supervisor would jeopardize national security, but such disclosures are not currently protected, as strange as that may seem. There is no reasonable basis for concern about giving whistleblowers throughout the Federal Government the right to contact those individuals about waste, fraud, or abuse of a classified nature. These additional protections will make it easier for these employees to do the responsible thing when it comes to classified disclosures. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Representative STEVE RUSSELL for introducing this bill, along with Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member ELIJAH CUMMINGS , and Representative STEPHEN LYNCH . This bill would provide important protections to whistleblowers who handle classified information and want to report waste, fraud, and abuse. Under this bill, an employee who is covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act could disclose to any supervisor in his or her direct chain of command classified information the employee reasonably believes shows wrongdoing. Under current law, if a whistleblower discloses classified information, the whistleblower is protected only if he or she makes those disclosures to the Office of Special Counsel, an inspector general, the head of the whistleblower’s agency, or an employee designated by the head of the agency. This bill would encourage employees who handle classified information to use proper channels to blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse. Allowing employees to go to a supervisor with evidence of wrongdoing may be less intimidating than going to the agency head or an inspector general. 
This bill is modeled on language in the Presidential Policy Directive issued in 2012. That directive, PPD 19, provided whistleblower protections to intelligence community employees who are not covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act. b1530 This bill will provide a more consistent approach for employees who handle classified information by ensuring that employees who are covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act will blow that whistle to a supervisor, the same way that intelligence community employees who are covered by PPD 19 can do so. This is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ranking Member CUMMINGS , Mr. F ARENTHOLD of Texas, and Mr. LYNCH of Massachusetts for their great bipartisan support in this needed reform, and I urge my colleagues to support my bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2196, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ALL CIRCUIT REVIEW ACT Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2229) to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide permanent authority for judicial review of certain Merit Systems Protection Board decisions relating to whistleblowers, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2229 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘All Circuit Review Act’’. 
SEC. 2. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD DECISIONS RELATING TO WHISTLEBLOWERS. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Section 7703(b)(1)(B) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by striking ‘‘During the 5year period beginning on the effective date of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, a petition’’ and inserting ‘‘A petition’’. (b) DIRECTOR REVIEW .—Section 7703(d)(2) of such title is amended by striking ‘‘During the 5year period beginning on the effective date of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, this paragraph’’ and inserting ‘‘This paragraph’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 2229, the All Circuit Review Act, which Ranking Member CUMMINGS of Maryland and Mr. FARENTHOLD of Texas introduced earlier this year. It is critical that we guarantee whistleblowers have access to fair and efficient reviews of their claims of retaliation. Between 1982 and 2012, whistleblowers could only appeal retaliation rulings made against them by the Merit Systems Protection Board, or the MSPB, to the Federal circuit. That monopoly led to the Federal circuit shaping key interpretations of whistleblower protection law without a check by any of the other circuit courts. In 2012, to the wide acclaim of the whistleblower community, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act ended the Federal circuit court’s monopoly over whistleblower retaliation appeals. The result, as expected, was better case law and more expeditious appeals. As a pilot program, that expansion was set to expire 3 years after enactment. In 2014, Congress acted to extend the program until November of this year. Now, this highly effective program will expire next month unless it is renewed. The whistleblower community has benefited tremendously from the pilot program. There is no good argument against making this permanent. Critics had feared that expanding jurisdiction over the MSPB appeals would lead to a torrent of cases for those circuits, swamping dockets across the Nation. Those fears have proved to be unfounded. Instead, the whistleblower community has benefited from other circuits having an opportunity to interpret Federal whistleblower case law. H.R. 2229 makes the all circuit expansion permanent, ensuring the benefits of the pilot program continue. This bipartisan initiative will put the question of appeal jurisdiction for whistleblower retaliation cases to rest once and for all. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY , Washington, DC, September 22, 2017. Hon. TREYGOWDY , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN GOWDY : I write with respect to H.R. 2229, the ‘‘All Circuit Review Act.’’ As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 2229 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 2229 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 2229 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 2229. Sincerely, BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, September 22, 2017. Hon. BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 2229, the All Circuit Review Act. As you noted, certain provisions of the bill fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary. I appreciate your willingness to forego action on the bill in the interest of expediting this legislation for floor consideration. I agree that foregoing consideration of the bill in no way diminishes or alters the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or any similar legislation. I will include a copy of our letter exchange on H.R. 2229 in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your assistance with this matter. Sincerely, TREYGOWDY . 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the All Circuit Review Act. This week the House is considering several bills to strengthen protections for whistleblowers. This is a bipartisan bill introduced by Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member CUMMINGS and Representative BLAKE FARENTHOLD . This bill would help level the playing field for whistleblowers by making permanent a pilot program that allows 
Federal whistleblowers to file appeals in courts where they work or live rather than in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The Federal circuit has a terrible track record on whistleblower cases. Allowing other courts around the country to hear whistleblower cases will provide a check on the monopoly the Federal circuit has held for many years. The bill would also authorize the Office of Personnel Management to appeal a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board to any appeals court with jurisdiction. This bill was listed on the Project On Government Oversight’s list of legislative reforms Congress should enact in 2017. Protecting whistleblowers is not a partisan issue. It is a patriotic issue. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ), ranking member of the full Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I introduced the All Circuit Review Act, Mr. Speaker, to send a clear message to all Federal employees who blow the whistle on wrongdoing that we here in Congress have their backs. This bill would give Federal employees who face retaliation for blowing the whistle a more equitable playing field when they challenge that retaliation in court. Under the bill, whistleblowers could file appeals in the jurisdictions where they work or live, rather than having to file appeals in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. Whistleblowers who live outside of Washington, D.C., should have the same opportunities as those who live in Washington. I want to thank Representative BLAKE FARENTHOLD for cosponsoring this bill with me. Representative FARENTHOLD has been a steadfast supporter of this basic due process right for Federal employees. The bill we are considering today makes permanent a pilot provision that was included in the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, which was signed into law in 2012. That pilot provision will expire in November if we do not send this bill to the President before then. Without this bill, whistleblowers could appeal a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board only to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal circuit has historically been overly restrictive of whistleblower rights. According to the Merit Systems Protection Board, 29 cases have been appealed to courts other than the Federal circuit since 2012. The Project On Government Oversight sent a letter to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on May 2, 2017, in strong support of this bill. Executive Director Danielle Brian wrote as follows: ‘‘The pilot program has been a success. It has not resulted in a flood of whistleblower appeals as opponents of the program asserted it would do, and it allows for potential circuit splits, which encourage sister circuits to review the laws and allows for possible Supreme Court review. It is working exactly as intended and should be made permanent before it expires in November 2017.’’ The bill was approved by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee without opposition in May. Two years ago, Congress approved an extension of the All Circuit Review Extension Act pilot program in 2014 without a single negative vote. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the whistleblower bill. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Chairman GOWDY for his support of this legislation, and for the hard work of Ranking Member CUMMINGS of Maryland and Mr. FARENTHOLD of Texas for all that they have done to bring this needed bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2229. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FREDERICK DOUGLASS BICENTENNIAL COMMISSION ACT Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2989) to establish the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2989 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission Act’’. 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) Born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in 1818 and given the name Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey after his mother Harriet Bailey, Frederick Douglass has been called the father of the civil rights movement. (2) Douglass rose through determination, brilliance, and eloquence to shape the American Nation. He was an abolitionist, human rights and women’s rights activist, orator, author, journalist, publisher, and social reformer. (3) Taught basic reading skills by his mistress until she was forced to stop, Douglass continued to teach himself to read and write and taught other slaves to read despite risks including death. (4) During the course of his remarkable life Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery, became internationally renowned for his eloquence in the cause of liberty, and went on to serve the national government in several official capacities. (5) Forced to leave the country to avoid arrest as an escaped slave, he returned to become a staunch advocate of the Union cause and helped recruit AfricanAmerican troops for the Union Army, including two of his sons, Charles and Lewis Douglass. His personal relationship with Abraham Lincoln helped persuade the President to make emancipation a cause of the Civil War. (6) With the abolition of slavery at the close of the Civil War, Douglass then turned his attention to the full integration of AfricanAmericans into the political and economic life of the United States. Committed to freedom, Douglass dedicated his life to achieving justice for all Americans, in particular AfricanAmericans, women, and minority groups. He envisioned America as an inclusive Nation strengthened by diversity and free of discrimination. (7) Douglass served as an advisor to Presidents. Abraham Lincoln referred to him as the most meritorious man of the nineteenth century. Douglass was appointed to several offices. He served as the United States Marshal of the District of Columbia under Rutherford B. Hayes’ administration; President James Garfield appointed Douglass the District of Columbia Recorder of Deeds. In 1889, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Frederick Douglass to be the United States minister to Haiti. He was also appointed by President Grant to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Commission of Inquiry to Santo Domingo. (8) Douglass lived in the District of Columbia for 23 of his 57 years as a free man, and in recognition of his leadership and continuous fight for justice and freedom, his home, Cedar Hill, was established as a National Historic Site in Anacostia, in Southeast Washington, DC. (9) The statue of Frederick Douglass in the United States Capitol is a gift from the almost 700,000 residents of the District of Columbia. (10) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Frederick Douglass, for Douglass dedicated his own life to ensuring freedom and equality for future generations of Americans. This Nation should ensure that his tireless struggle, transformative words, and inclusive vision of humanity continue to inspire and sustain us. (11) The year 2018 marks the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Frederick Douglass, and a commission should be established to plan, develop, and carry out, and to recommend to Congress, programs and activities that are fitting and proper to celebrate that anniversary in a manner that appropriately honors Frederick Douglass.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 2989, the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission Act, introduced by Ms. NORTON of the District of Columbia and Mr. HARRIS earlier this year. Next year will mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Frederick Douglass, a man who has been called the father—and rightfully so—of the civil rights movement. Douglass was born into slavery in Maryland around 1817 but escaped by the age of 21. Douglass went on to publish an autobiography documenting his life as a slave, called, ‘‘Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,’’ while a fugitive slave. Throughout his remarkable life, Douglass advocated for justice for all Americans, encouraging President Lincoln to make emancipation a cause of the Civil War, and advocating for the full integration of African Americans into political and economic life in the United States both during and following the war. H.R. 2989 establishes the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission to recommend the best ways to celebrate the legacy of a man who dedicated his entire life to ensuring freedom and equality for all Americans. H.R. 2989 would do this by creating a 16member commission to plan, develop, and coordinate activities fitting and proper to honor Mr. Douglass. The commission will submit two reports to Congress with recommendations for activities, programs, and other important information. The commission will end 30 days after the submission of its final report. The amended text considered today adds a new section clarifying that the commission will not receive additional authorized funds and will, instead, rely on private funds for its operations. The commission presents an important opportunity to recognize and support Frederick Douglass’ leadership and body of work. He was a phenomenal man, and I am proud to also be a cosponsor of this important bill. 
I would like to thank Ms. N ORTON , Mr. HARRIS , and the 16 other cosponsors for their hard work on this bill in honor of Frederick Douglass. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the lead sponsor of this bill, Representative ANDY HARRIS , for working closely with me on the bill of which I am a cosponsor, and I want to thank my good friend Representative RUSSELL , who is managing on the other side, for also being a cosponsor of this bill. My thanks also to Chairman TREY GOWDY , Ranking Member E LIJAH CUMMINGS , and Majority Leader K EVIN MCCARTHY for bringing this bill to the floor in time to begin the commemoration, in 2018, of the bicentennial of the birth of Frederick Douglass. I am pleased that this bill has not only bipartisan, but bicameral support. Senators CHRIS VANHOLLEN and B EN CARDIN have introduced the companion bill in the Senate. b1545 The bill would establish a commission to plan and carry out programs and activities, as well as to recommend to Congress programs and activities that the Federal Government could undertake to honor and celebrate the life of Frederick Douglass during the bicentennial of his birth in 2018. Frederick Douglass was born into slavery in 1818 on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. He learned basic reading skills from his mistress and continued to teach himself and other slaves to read and write despite the risks he faced, including death. After two attempts, Douglass successfully escaped to New York and went on to become this country’s leading abolitionist and antislavery lecturer. He served in several administrations, including as close adviser to President Abraham Lincoln, U.S. Marshal of the District of Columbia under President Rutherford B. Hayes, and District of Columbia Recorder of Deeds under President James Garfield. In 1889, President Benjamin Harris appointed Frederick Douglass to be the U.S. Minister to Haiti. He was later appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to serve as secretary of the commission of Santo Domingo. Douglass dedicated his life to achieving justice for all Americans. He lived in the District of Columbia for 23 of his 57 years as a free man, and his home at Cedar Hill is an official National Historic Site in southeast Washington, D.C. Every year, thousands of Americans and others visit Cedar Hill. The Frederick Douglass statue that stands in his honor in the United States Capitol is a gift from the nearly 700,000 residents of the District of Columbia. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HARRIS ), who is the original cosponsor of this bill. Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the committee for promptly reporting H.R. 2989 to the floor for consideration. I rise today in support of a bill I have cosponsored with Delegate NORTON , the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission Act. As we approach the 200th anniversary of Frederick Douglass’ birth, I urge my colleagues in the House to support this legislation. The purpose of this bill is more than just honoring the birth of one great civil rights leader. Its purpose is to recognize his lasting impact on American Government, culture, and values. Frederick Douglass’ work stretched far beyond the fight for legal freedom into the equally important fight for social and cultural equality. Born on Maryland’s beautiful Eastern Shore, Douglass escaped slavery to become an author, abolitionist, and true American hero. Frederick Douglass is a model for the values that make our Nation great: equality, liberty, and a commitment to working hard and helping others. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to honor Frederick Douglass and the resounding impact his work has had on modern American culture by passing this legislation. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to echo all of the comments that we heard. It is important that all of us take time and pause to recognize the tremendous work that Frederick Douglass did not only in his life, but how he impacted the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2989, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
TSP MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3031) to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for flexibility in making withdrawals from a Thrift Savings Plan account, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3031, the TSP Modernization Act of 2017, introduced by Ranking Member CUMMINGS from Maryland and Mr. MEADOWS from North Carolina earlier this year. Federal employees enrolled in the Federal Employees Retirement System—known as FERS—enjoy the benefits of a threepart retirement structure. Those are a defined benefit pension plan, Social Security, and a 401(k) style defined contribution plan known as the Thrift Savings Plan, or TSP. With its low administrative costs and simple design, the TSP is an ideal retirement vehicle. Participants can choose from a variety of investment options, including index funds designed to track the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index, or a low risk government securities investment fund. Participants can also passively manage their investments by putting money into a Lifecycle Fund, which allows the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to purchase a combination of investments based on the year the employee is expected to retire. Employees have a lot of options when investing their TSP funds, but when it comes to withdrawing their funds, the options are much more limited. This is because current statutory rules preclude employees from taking multiple postservice partial withdrawals. Employees cannot request a partial withdrawal or annuity purchase after making a periodic payment withdrawal election. Statutory rules also require the purchase of an annuity if a participant fails to make an election by age 70
1⁄2. The rules also restrict an employee’s ability to make multiple inservice, agebased withdrawals. The Board conducted a study in 2013, which found that separated participants moved $9 billion from the TSP fund to other, costlier institutions. Nearly one out of every three of these participants cited a desire for additional withdrawal flexibility. The study also found that, among currently employed participants, the same ratio of participants requested additional withdrawal flexibility for agebased withdrawals to address life events that arise. This bill would afford those additional flexibilities to address those concerns. The bill provides more control to Federal employees over their own retirement by allowing for multiple post separation partial withdrawals and in service, agebased withdrawals. H.R. 3031 allows employees to change withdrawal elections as they grow older, and it allows the Board to avoid purchasing expensive annuities if a participant fails to make an election by age 701⁄2. This bill puts power and control in the hands of the employees that make our Federal Government run to make retirement decisions based on their personal situations. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3031, the TSP Modernization Act of 2017. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, which would help modernize the Federal Government’s Thrift Savings Plan by aligning it with current practices for private sector 401(k)s. I thank Ranking Member CUMMINGS  and Chairman MEADOWS for their work on this important, bipartisan bill that would give TSP participants more flexibility in making withdrawals from their accounts. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3031, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ), who is the ranking member of the full committee. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3031, the TSP Modernization Act of 2017. I thank the Government Operations Subcommittee chairman, Mr. MEADOWS, for working with me in a bipartisan manner on this commonsense, good government bill. I also thank the Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman, Mr. GOWDY , for his support of this legislation. Congressman MEADOWS and I introduced this legislation to make the Federal Government’s Thrift Savings Plan more closely align with private sector best practices by allowing TSP participants more flexible withdrawal options. In 2013, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board found that employees who separated from Federal service transferred $9 billion out of their TSP accounts to other financial institutions. TSP participants do this because private sector 401(k) plans provide more flexibility, and they wanted more options for withdrawing money in case they needed it. A 2014 survey of TSP participants who withdrew funds showed that more than 50 percent reported that they wanted more flexibility to withdraw funds to address life events. Current law limits participants to only one withdrawal from their TSP accounts while in Federal service after reaching age 591⁄2, and participants who make this type of agebased withdrawal cannot take another partial withdrawal once they separate from service. Similarly, participants who are separated from Federal service and who have not made a prior agebased withdrawal are restricted to making only one partial separation withdrawal. H.R. 3031 would eliminate these restrictions and allow participants to make multiple agebased and postseparation withdrawals from TSP accounts. The bill also would allow participants to elect to combine partial withdrawals with an annuity. It also would eliminate automatic annuities as a default option in the absence of an election by participants. By providing greater withdrawal flexibility, studies show that participants would be more likely to keep their assets in their TSP accounts. For example, a study issued by Vanguard in 2013 found that 50 percent more participants and assets remain in retirement plans when partial disbursements are allowed. Providing more withdrawal options for Federal employees and retirees in the TSP may help their financial security since administrative fees for the TSP are much lower than fees charged by other financial institutions. This legislation is supported by the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, the American Federation of Government Employees, and the National Treasury Employees Union. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Chairman GOWDY , Ranking Member CUMMINGS , and Chairman MEADOWS for their outstanding work in addressing the needs of Federal employees who give selfless public service to our Nation and should have this flexibility in their retirement planning. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3031, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1600 FITARA ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2017 Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3243) to amend title 40, United 
States Code, to eliminate the sunset of certain provisions relating to information technology, to amend the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 to extend the sunset relating to the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3243 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘FITARA Enhancement Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF SUNSET RELATING TO TRANSPARENCY AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF MAJOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS. 
Subsection (c) of section 11302 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by striking the first paragraph (5). 
SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF SUNSET RELATING TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, PROGRAM, AND RESOURCE REVIEWS. 
Section 11319 of title 40, United States Code, is amended— (1) by redesignating the second subsection (c) as subsection (d); and (2) in subsection (d), as so redesignated, by striking paragraph (6). 
SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF SUNSET RELATING TO FEDERAL DATA CENTER CONSOLIDATION INITIATIVE. 
Subsection (e) of section 834 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113–291; 44 U.S.C. 3601 note) is amended by striking ‘‘2018’’ and inserting ‘‘2020’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 3243, the FITARA Enhancement Act of 2017, introduced by Mr. CONNOLLY , Mr. I SSA, Ms. K ELLY from Illinois, and Mr. MEADOWS earlier this year. Today, the Federal Government spends more than $90 billion on Federal IT, with approximately 75 percent of this money spent on archaic and legacy IT. This means we are paying more for less: less capability and less security. Meanwhile, major Federal IT investments often result in multimilliondollar cost overruns and delays. This state of affairs led the Government Accountability Office to designate Federal IT acquisition and management as high risk in 2015, meaning this area is at high risk of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. In 2014, Congress passed the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, otherwise known as FITARA, to address some of these IT challenges. Congress has maintained a watchful eye to ensure agencies fully implement the requirements of FITARA and use it as a vital oversight tool. In fact, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has held five hearings on FITARA implementation. The committee also created a FITARA scorecard to hold Federal agencies accountable for meeting FITARA requirements, some of which sunset in the near term. This bill will help us facilitate Congress’ oversight efforts by extending key FITARA requirements to improve Federal IT. For example, this bill extends requirements for agencies to publicly report schedule and cost information and to assess the risks of major IT investments. This bill also extends requirements for each agency to regularly assess its IT portfolio, look for opportunities to reduce duplication, and find savings. Finally, the bill will help us continue to hold agencies accountable for consolidating and optimizing their data centers by extending these requirements—and GAO’s verification of these requirements—through 2020. The GAO, which has been instrumental in assisting Congress oversee FITARA implementation, supports extending the FITARA sunset dates. Mr. CONNOLLY from Virginia and Mr. ISSAfrom California have been the key leaders on the original FITARA law, and they have come together again to sponsor this bill, along with Representatives MEADOWS and K ELLY . The FITARA Enhancement Act is truly a bipartisan effort in making sure Federal agencies get their information technology management and acquisition houses in order. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ), the sponsor of the bill. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, DARRELL ISSA, the cosponsor of this bill and the cosponsor of the original FITARA; and my good friend from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) for his able management today. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, or FITARA, was enacted 3 years ago. It represented the first major reform of the laws governing the procurement and management of Federal IT since the Clinger Cohen Act of 1996. FITARA is the framework for IT procurement and ensures the Federal Government is making smart and effective investments to modernize its IT, which is badly needed. It has seven pillars: First, it enhances CIO authorities, responsibilities, and accountability. Second, it enhances transparency and improves risk management by requiring detailed information on investments to be published on the IT dashboard. Third, we increased the frequency of portfolio reviews from annual to quarterly and included key decisionmakers from the agency and OMB to not only look for ways to increase efficiency, but to eliminate duplication. Fourth, we built on the Federal data center consolidation effort to push agencies to realize big savings from this lowhanging fruit. Fifth, people. Recognizing that Federal IT success is only as good as the people behind it, FITARA calls for expanding the training and use of IT professionals. Sixth, FITARA seeks to maximize new tools like the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative, taking a page from the private sector to reduce duplicative spending on common purchases and off theshelf items. Finally, FITARA advances a government software purchasing program to allow for purchasing licensing agreements that can be made available for use by all Federal agencies. FITARA is a rubric for IT procurement that, hopefully, someday enables initiatives like the Modernizing Government Technology Act to build on our success of improving how the government acquires and modernizes IT. When the stakeholders met on Federal IT from government agencies and industry, both Mr. ISSA and I constantly were reminded of why previous major IT reform efforts had fallen short of their potential: the lack of robust implementation plan and congressional oversight. As Mr. RUSSELL indicated quite clearly, in that latter regard, we have robust oversight, and it will continue. One of the things we had in FITARA were some sunset provisions, in the hope and expectation that, by having that, we would encourage cooperation and implementation. That cooperation and implementation is uneven throughout the Federal Government. The GAO, or Government Accountability Office, recommended that we have this bill to extend those sunset provisions to buy a little bit more time to get with the program for those Federal agencies. So that is what this bill does, but it builds on FITARA, which is the framework for IT procurement and modernization. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. ISSA), an original cosponsor of this bill and also the former chairman of the Government and Oversight Reform Committee. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, no one has ever had a better partner on a piece of 
legislation than I have had. The best way I can describe Mr. CONNOLLY is, like anyone else who came to a realization of something, he came to it with a great deal of zeal. This partnership, which began before the passage in 2014, to modernize a 1996 initiative that had fallen short, has been his passion and mine. Normally, when you are chairman, people talk about what divides the committee. But nothing united us more than recognizing that over $80 billion was being spent—and much of it needlessly. We don’t achieve what we want to because there is never enough. Part of it is how we procure. Prior to the passage of this legislation, it certainly was possible to have major pieces of procurement have somebody in charge who could not, in fact, change or drop the expenditure and who could not simply say: This isn’t working. On top of that, often the people who did have the authority lacked the expertise. This has been true in all sorts of areas. There is much more work to be done. Unlike ClingerCohen, which went on for 18 years before being updated, we were just 3 years past the implementation of this bill. With Congressman CONNOLLY ’s effort, we are coming back and making real changes—ones that can continue the process and speed it up. Obviously, there are some areas like the IT dashboard and others that simply need to be continued to be renewed. This bill does it. When I first talked to Mr. CONNOLLY , he was the best known for absolutely wanting to consolidate processing centers; consolidate these server farms that had proliferated. The number he had at the time turned out to be, although exorbitant, less than a quarter of the number we found. So there is more work to be done. Procurement has to be done smart and is often consolidated. With the help of my colleague and Senator WARNER, the passage of the DATA Act allowed us to find, with greater detail, redundancy of expenditure. So as we reauthorize FITARA, we also have the information to consolidate purchasing across vast numbers of agencies, eliminate redundancy, and, in fact, buy better. More needs to be done. As Mr. CONNOLLY said so accurately, more money is spent on legacy systems than is spent on new systems that will actually save money and provide better services both to government workers and to the public. So as we reauthorize the bill, I look forward to the oversight that the Oversight Committee has done and is able to do, and I look forward to continuing to work with my partner from Virginia, Mr. CONNOLLY . Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R. 3243, the FITARA Enhancement Act. FITARA is bipartisan legislation that has made significant strides in reforming government IT and making agencies more accountable. I thank Representative CONNOLLY for all his hard work on this bill, as well as my good friend who has just spoken, Mr. RUSSELL . This bill would extend three provisions of FITARA that are set to expire. These provisions include the provision on Federal data center consolidation; transparency and risk management of major IT systems; and agencies’ IT portfolio, program, and resource reviews, also known as PortfolioStat. These provisions provide transparency and accountability for agencies and should be continued. GAO reports that if we allow these provisions to expire, we will miss out on major savings. IT spending makes up roughly $100 billion of government spending each year. We cannot afford to allow this legislation that will save funds and help modernize IT assets to simply expire. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strongly support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOWDY , Mr. C ONNOLLY from Virginia, and Mr. ISSAfrom California for this important and continued work that will not only improve IT and reduce duplication but will continue to save billions of taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3243. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess for a period of less than 15 minutes. Accordingly (at 4 o’clock and 14 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1629 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ) at 4 o’clock and 29 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to make votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 562, and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 563. 
LIMITING TO A CERTAIN DATE APPLICABILITY OF PROVISIONS OF SECTION 7 OF THE WAR POWERS RESOLUTION TO HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 81 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the provisions of section 7 of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1546) shall apply to H. Con. Res. 81 not earlier than November 2, 2017, but on the same terms that would have adhered on October 13, 2017. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. 
REMEMBERING SERGEANT DUSTIN WRIGHT (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a Toombs County native. Twentynineyearold Staff Sergeant Dustin Michael Wright was one of the three U.S. Army Green Beret soldiers killed in the line of duty last week. The U.S. Africa Command says Dustin was part of a team assisting in advising local forces in southwest Niger at the time of the ambush. A 2007 graduate from Toombs County High School, Dustin joined the Army soon after graduation, following in the footsteps of his parents and his brother. His family remembers him as a beloved jokester and was always making people laugh. He took great pride in serving the country, and I am so proud to see the Toombs County community coming together to paint the town red, white, and blue in honor of Dustin’s life. Dustin was truly a hometown hero, and Toombs County will remember him often. As Jesus said: ‘‘Greater love has no one than this, to lay down one’s life for his friends.’’ Dustin sacrificed his life for his brothers and sisters in service to this great country. I will never forget our freedom fighter from Toombs County. MaST COMMUNITY CHARTER SCHOOL NAMED A 2017 BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL OF EXCELLENCE (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize MaST Community Charter School, an incredible institution in my district that was just named a 2017 Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the Department of Education. MaST is a groundbreaking educational community that emphasizes collaborative, technologydriven, handson learning. They are preparing the next generation of American leaders and visionaries who will change the future in ways we can only imagine. Blue Ribbon schools are characterized by the highest level of academic excellence and by their success in closing achievement gaps across student populations. These elite institutions are a gold standard of instruction, inclusion, and innovation. MaST Community Charter School was one of only 342 schools across the country to earn this honor this year. I want to congratulate the teachers, staff, administrators, parents, and students of the MaST Community Charter School on their remarkable and well deserved achievement. f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JESUS A. PERMUY (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor my constituent, Jesus A. Permuy, for a lifetime of service to our south Florida community and to the cause of liberty in my native homeland of Cuba. Like my family and me and so many others in my congressional district, Jesus was forced to flee Castro’s brutal tyranny. Jesus embraced his new life here in the United States and became involved in numerous civic and community affairs while working to restore freedom and democracy in Cuba. In 1976, Jesus secured accreditation for the Christian Democratic Movement of Cuba to speak before the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. For decades, Mr. Permuy has been involved in a number of human rights advocacy organizations denouncing the systemic repression brought upon the Cuban people by the evil Castro regime. Jesus founded the Center for Human Rights in Miami. He is a dedicated husband, a proud father of 8 children, and a grandfather of 11 grandchildren. Jesus is a shining example to us all. Thank you, Jesus A. Permuy, for your service to our community and to my native Cuba. REFUGES HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, each year, millions of Americans visit wildlife refuges throughout the country. They generate over $2 billion in economic activity and create 35,000 jobs. This wouldn’t be possible without help from dedicated and hardworking volunteers. That is why we have introduced H.R. 3979, bipartisan legislation that reauthorizes the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer, Community Partnership, and Education Program. This program ensures public access to refuges for exploring, hunting, fishing, and studying wildlife. Refuges have a tremendous impact, even in Brooklyn, where Fish and Wildlife Service staff and volunteers work with local public schools to cultivate the next generation of conservationists and wildlife enthusiasts through hands on learning. Carmen Wheeler, a second grade student in Brooklyn, recently wrote to me and said: ‘‘I think we should keep the wildlife refugees safe, even if they are far away, because they will always keep our world healthier.’’ We are with you, Carmen. f 
GIVING TO CHARITY IS CRUCIAL (Mr. WALKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to announce the introduction of the Universal Charitable Giving Act. Many Americans believe that people, not the government, offer the best solutions to solve the ailments that face our society. Strong families, strong churches, and strong communities are the foundations of our Nation. By supporting charities, we can make our communities and our country a better place for Americans from all walks of life. Giving to charity is crucial for economic prosperity, happiness, and the success of our people, but for too long only the most wealthy have been incentivized to give to the causes they believe in. The Universal Charitable Giving Act incentivizes charitable giving for low and middleincome taxpayers. It would allow everyone to deduct charitable giving, regardless of itemizing status. With tax reform, our aim is to increase takehome pay for middle America. With my bill, our goal is to increase support for all charities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the great work of our faith based and charitable organizations by supporting this bill. 
NAFTA RENEGOTIATIONS BEGIN (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this week, the fourth round of NAFTA renegotiations will begin. President Trump will have an opportunity to deliver on his promise last year to get a better deal for American workers. I hope he does. Our current trade deals are rigged in favor of the largest corporations in this country and against working people. In my home State of Rhode Island, we have lost 41,000 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and the WTO took effect. That is more than half of the manufacturing jobs in my State. The folks who kept their jobs have seen their paychecks get smaller. Rhode Islanders know, most importantly, that we need a trade deal that is fair; but they know that trade deals that we have now help powerful corporations, but they are killing American jobs, helping corporations outsource jobs at the expense of working people. This week I am asking President Trump to demand a new NAFTA agreement that has strong labor and environmental protections, that end foreign tribunals that allow corporations to sue the U.S. Government and force taxpayers to pay the bill, that has better Buy American requirements, that has strict protections against currency manipulation, that has strong rules of origin on manufactured goods, and that has provisions that bring down the cost of prescription drugs. These are commonsense provisions that will empower American working families, and they should be included in any new trade agreement. 
HOPE FOR TRAFFICKED VICTIMS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for years, Lynda could not bring herself to speak about her past turmoil and nightmares. Lynda is finally telling about her tortured life. When she was 16, two neighborhood boys drugged and sexually assaulted her. Highly drugged, the boys convinced her to have sex for money just once. But it wasn’t for just one time, Mr. Speaker. They set up online advertisements to sell her and other girls. When one of the other girls tried to escape, they tied her to a chair and beat her up mercilessly. They mixed drugs into the food to maintain control over the girls. It was years before Lynda finally escaped her turmoil. Today, the rape and torture still haunts Lynda, but she works every day to become a survivor. I recently introduced the Abolish Human Trafficking Act that provides grants to ensure that victims like Lynda get help and services, such as mental health counseling, legal aid, job training, things that they deserve from us. This will help trafficking victims put their broken lives back together. Trafficking is a scourge, and we need to send a message to everyone that our kids are not for sale. And that is just the way it is. f 
b1715 WHITE HOUSE IMMIGRATION PRINCIPLES (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the cruel immigration proposal unveiled by the White House this week. This proposal goes beyond some of the worst immigration bills. It demands billions more for border security, tightens asylum standards, cuts off legal immigration, and implements a faulty pointsbased system, undercutting our core values as a country and destroying our economy and our future. Mr. Speaker, twothirds of all immigrants to the United States are women and children, and these policies will disproportionately hurt them. A pointsbased system eliminates family based immigration, and it is insulting to the valuable contributions of women, especially. Nearly 70 percent of all women immigrants with legal status obtained it through the family system, and many are stuck in visa backlogs waiting years and even decades to reunite with their families. Mr. Speaker, immigration has never been just about immigration. It has always been about who we are as a country and what we are willing to stand up for. I believe the majority of my Republican colleagues want to pass the Dream Act, and I ask them to join us in rejecting these antiimmigrant poison pills and proposing real solutions that benefit the American people and unify our country. 
RECOGNIZING JEREMY RICH, NEW YORK’S 2017 NATIONAL DISTINGUISHED PRINCIPAL (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeremy Rich, the principal at Barringer Road Elementary School in Ilion, a constituent of the 22nd Congressional District. For his stellar record of service, professionalism, and contributions to the educational process, Mr. Rich was named New York’s 2017 National Distinguished Principal by the National Association of Elementary School Principals. In 2013, Mr. Rich became the principal of Barringer Road Elementary. Since that day, he has arrived at school promptly at 6:30 a.m. each morning, bringing a positive attitude and inspirational words to each morning announcement. Prior to his service at Barringer Road, Mr. Rich served as principal at the nowclosed Remington Elementary School, where he was integral in facilitating the successful merger of the Mohawk and Ilion school districts. During his time at Ilion Junior High School, he served as the principal, the dean of students, and an English teacher. Mr. Rich’s commitment to his role is unparalleled. Both teachers and parents alike describe Mr. Rich as comforting, helpful, and passionate. One teacher described him as a ‘‘superstar principal and a fantastic human being.’’ Mr. Rich’s record exemplifies his clear dedication to public education, his students, and our community. Please join me today in congratulating this wellrespected educator and beloved member of the 22nd District. f 
FOCUS ON THE PAIN THAT PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me first of all say what the world is coming to and how much our friends, our neighbors in America have had to go through: the most recent tragedy and massacre in Las Vegas, and now the horrendous, unspeakable tragedy by fires in California. I offer my sympathy to my friends, MIKEand J ARED , Congresspersons in California, and we look forward to working with them, and offer our sympathy for those who are lost, those who are missing. I think it is important, as we have these natural disasters, that we really attentively work on the pain that people are suffering; that is on the back side of Puerto Rico, where there is no power, and we don’t know the assessment of loss of life, there is no housing; from Florida to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where people are still waiting for relief, and the attention is not at the peak that it should. Then, in my own community, we are in desperate need of housing. We have senior citizens, after Hurricane Harvey, being dismissed and out of their homes. Finally, Mr. Speaker, we are looking for a new disaster supplemental food program. We have the okay from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We have the State of Texas ready to work with us, but we must make sure that our local officials realize that this is a disaster and an emergency and that they move forward quickly to serve the people who are hungry and who are in need. 
So, Harris County, you need to move faster to use the Federal funds that we now have. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF TOM PETTY (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Gainesville’s native son, Mr. Tom Petty. Thomas Earl Petty was born on October 20, 1950, and, over a career that spanned five decades, collected 28 top 10 hits, the most of all time. But his contribution cannot be measured in hits or awards. He wrote America’s soundtrack. Tom Petty’s story sounds familiar. He grew up in a small town, struggled, persisted, and then succeeded—a true American Dream story. But it is not what he did; it is how he did it that strikes us. It is the honesty, wit, and sentimentality that made his music special. Every hit Tom Petty crafted became an anthem, each song a score to the memorable moments of our lives. American life would be much diminished without his work. Jefferson and Madison wrote our system. Twain wrote our story that described Early American folklore. Petty wrote our songs. The songbook of America is bigger and brighter because of him. Rest in peace as you continue ‘‘Runnin’ Down a Dream.’’ 
REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. TAYLOR ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, we are here today because, almost 11 months ago, the American people voted to give Republicans control of unified government. They were tired of being crushed by rising healthcare costs due to ObamaCare. They wanted America’s economy to prosper again. They wanted a secure border. During the months that followed, Congress worked with President Trump to sign over 50 bills into law. On top of that, the House passed over 270 laws that now sit in the Senate awaiting action. Despite this legislation, there is a unified voice that is loud and clear arriving daily from our base, saying, ‘‘Get something done.’’ The reason for that call is because Americans continue to be crushed by government policies, something that is very evident. These are the same policies that drove them to vote for us in the first place. Americans are scarred by the broken promises of the former administration. They could not keep their doctor, even though they were told by the former President they could. Their premiums did not go down $2,500, and their exchanges did not work. ObamaCare resulted in fewer options and increased costs for many Americans. Outofpocket costs continue to soar, with overage deductibles for bronze plans topping $6,000 in 2017. Some States, like Arizona, faced premium increases of 116 percent; Oklahoma, 69 percent. Tennessee faced a 63 percent increase. And onethird of counties have only one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Some entire States like Wyoming, right below me, South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Alaska only have one insurer. Think about that. This trend is predicted to worsen, with half of American counties only having one insurer in 2018. As we have come to almost 8 years with the ACA, or ObamaCare, we run a risk of thinking that it is normal. Our healthcare system was not perfect before. We are not making that case. But ObamaCare made what was already bad even worse. We cannot think of these stats as mere numbers. Americans are really suffering under this law. Just because Senate Majority Leader MCCONNELL  gave up on repealing ObamaCare in the Senate does not mean Americans will give Congress and Republicans a pass. We cannot and we must not give up on this important promise. The burden of ObamaCare is only made worse by the lackluster growth of the economy in recent years. During the Obama administration years, the economy failed to grow even once at the historic goal of 3 percent a year, something we just saw in our last quarter. Americans are as industrious and innovative as ever. Americans’ work ethic is not the problem. It is our antiquated tax system that has been bogged down over the years by regulators and lobbyists. Since our last major rewrite of the Tax Code 31 years ago, the same year that ‘‘Top Gun’’ was number one in the box office, 1986, our Tax Code has added over 35,000 pages. Think about that— 35,000 pages. That is about three changes per day. Each page is another carveout or a loophole for the well connected, leaving the rest of the economy behind. Our companies are at a disadvantage internationally, as our tax rate stands at 35 percent, the highest, as we know now, in the industrialized world. Families continue to be punished with a marriage penalty. Our Tax Code should be a competitive advantage for our companies competing with the world. It should encourage innovators to push the boundaries and find success. The call to get something done that we hear loud and clear from Americans is also coupled with a call to make sure that we are doing our very best to secure the border. Perhaps there is no more vocal call from the past year than to build that wall. In 2016, the United States saw a surge in illegal border crossings, with 46,000 illegals apprehended in that October alone. This is both a fiscal and a security issue. Border security is more than just the border, though. Visa overstays are responsible for up to 40 percent of illegal immigration. We need a solution, and we need an action to this problem if we are truly to secure the border. To add to these problems, more than 100 sanctuary jurisdictions have enacted policies which restrict cooperation with ICE, allowing potentially dangerous illegal immigrant criminals to remain in our country. I am confident that the American people will deliver their final grade on Republicans over the next 3 months simply based on the three issues, the three promises that I am speaking about today: number one, continuing to work and replace and repeal ObamaCare; number two, reforming the Tax Code; and, number three, securing the border. In short, repeal, reform, secure; repeal, reform, secure. We need to fulfill these promises in the next 3 months. The urgency and the time is now. As I said before, the status quo on these policies is literally crushing Americans, and this is why they elected Republicans. In fact, since 1913, when Republicans expanded, or when the House expanded the 387 Members to 435, this is the only time in history when backtoback Congresses, the Americans have elected 240 or more Republicans, and it is time we did our job. We need to keep our promises to the American people. I am pleased to be joined by members of the Republican Study Committee today to talk about the importance of keeping these promises. That is why it is my privilege to introduce one of our newer members from Kansas, Representative RONESTES. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES). Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, after a decade of inadequate economic growth across America, there is new growing optimism that our economy is about to be set free again. Consumer confidence in the economy is the highest it has been since 2000. Why? I believe this is because the American people expect us to reform our broken Tax Code, and they are excited about it. Our outdated and overly complex Tax Code has held our economy down for the past decade. It is time we fix this and empower working families in America. Real tax reform will be the best way to help America climb up the economic ladder. A stronger economy will bring higher wages and better jobs. The goal is to make our Federal Code simple and to make it fair. b1730 The Tax Code, as it is, only benefits the rich and wellconnected who can 
hire an army of lawyers to protect their interests. This is why Republicans are looking to enact real reform for all Americans. The argument against tax reform is this: the plan is just a tax cut for the rich. The reality is, this tax reform framework is focused on helping middle class families. The tax system is laid out by Republicans that allows low and middleincome workers to keep more of their hardearned paychecks in order to save for their children’s college, for their retirement, or any other things that they want. I implore my colleagues across the aisle to do what is right and help to fix our antiquated Tax Code. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative ESTES. Perhaps no one knows more and has had more experience than the chairman of our Judiciary Committee, a former immigration attorney who has spent years working on resolving these issues. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ). Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate the gentleman organizing this hour of Special Order remarks, and your leadership on these three important issues. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the importance of bolstering enforcement of existing immigration law and securing the border. The interior enforcement and border security are vital to enhancing public safety, keeping the door open to lawabiding immigrants, protecting our borders, and restoring the rule of law. Under President Obama, interior enforcement deteriorated dramatically as his administration refused to enforce immigration laws, rewrote the law through executive action, and implemented policies that enabled millions of unlawful and criminal aliens to remain in the United States free from any possibility of removal. The Obama administration’s policies had—and continue to have—disturbing consequences. The rule of law was undermined as hundreds of thousands of Central American unaccompanied minors and families arrived at the southwest border during the Obama years and were released into the U.S. Too many Americans were killed or seriously harmed at the hands of aliens who joined gangs or committed crimes. Fortunately, the Trump administration has begun to reverse the Obama administration’s disastrous policies and is enforcing the law as written by Congress. President Trump has issued executive orders to strengthen interior enforcement and implement strong border security measures. The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security are already executing these executive orders, and there have been quick results. Illegal border crossings at the Southwest border dropped dramatically at the beginning of the Trump administration due, in large part, to consistent enforcement of the law and the strong message that the U.S. no longer tolerates illegal immigration. However, illegal border crossings are rising again despite the best efforts of the Trump administration, demonstrating that the President should be granted additional, longneeded legislative tools. The House Judiciary Committee has been hard at work to improve our Nation’s immigration laws and has already approved bills that are crucial to enable our country to gain control of our immigration system. The DavisOliver Act is the keystone of our interior enforcement efforts and is named after Placer County Detective Michael Davis, Jr., and Sacramento County Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two California law enforcement officers who were murdered by an unlawful immigrant in October 2014. The bill improves the enforcement of our Nation’s immigration laws to enhance public safety. Specifically, the DavisOliver Act provides tools to crack down on dangerous sanctuary city policies and contains muchneeded changes to protect American communities from unlawful immigrants who commit crimes in the United States, or are gang members. The DavisOliver Act also enhances national security by improving our Nation’s first line of defense, the visa issuance process. It provides thorough screening of foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States in order to prevent terrorists from entering our country. The bill also ensures the rule of law and removes the ability of any President to unilaterally shut down immigration enforcement by granting States and localities the authority to voluntarily assist in the enforcement of Federal immigration law and to enforce their own immigration laws consistent with Federal practices. The House Judiciary Committee has also approved several bills to reform the asylum and refugee programs to curtail rampant fraud, while ensuring that our Nation continues to be a safe haven for those persecuted around the world. The surge of Central American unaccompanied alien minors and family units seeking to enter the U.S. illegally at our southern border put a strain on manpower and resources. It also exposed loopholes in our Nation’s immigration laws that are being exploited by smugglers and others seeking to game the system. The Asylum Reform and Border Patrol Act makes a number of improvements to our Nation’s laws to prevent fraud and abuse in the system and assure that asylum is reserved for those truly fleeing persecution in their home country. Further, the Protection of Children Act makes sure that unaccompanied alien minors who make the dangerous journey to the United States are swiftly and safely returned home. For those who stay with a sponsor in the United States while awaiting their immigration hearing, the bill provides for greater transparency and safety to these minors to ensure that they are not inadvertently delivered into the hands of criminals or abusers. The Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act reforms the refugee program by curbing fraud and strengthening public safety and national security. It also provides State and local governments the power to decide if refugees are to be resettled within their communities and gives Congress, not the President, the authority to set the overall refugee ceiling for each year. The House Judiciary Committee also plans to bring up a bill that protects jobs for citizens and legal workers, the Legal Workforce Act. This bill requires all U.S. employers to check the work eligibility of all future hires through the tried and tested EVerify system. EVerify quickly confirms 99 percent of workeligible employees and takes less than 2 minutes to use. Over 740,000 American employers currently use EVerify, and 83 percent of America’s employers support a mandatory electronic verification system. While many aspects of our Nation’s immigration system need to be improved, including our guest worker program for American agriculture, we must strengthen the enforcement of our immigration laws. Immigration enforcement is crucial to maintain our sovereignty, to protect national security, and to restore the rule of law. Mr. Speaker, I call on Congress to take up the House Judiciary Committee’s immigration enforcement bills soon. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOODLATTE and appreciate those powerful words. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DESANTIS ), a colleague and one of the sharpest, most intellectual Members of Congress. Mr. DESANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from North Carolina for yielding. Mr. Speaker, if you were trying to do damage to the United States and you wanted to design a Tax Code that hindered economic growth, that diverted a lot of productive energy, that basically kept America from reaching its economic potential, you probably couldn’t do much worse than designing the code that we have. It is enormously complex—70,000 plus pages. I confess, there is no way I can do my own taxes, and I think that is true for millions and millions of Americans. There is a frustration with that, but it also costs massive amounts of money and diverts energy. We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars that get diverted to complying with the Tax Code, and that is not optimal for economic growth. It repels capital and incentivizes companies to relocate overseas and take jobs overseas. You see companies reincorporating in Ireland or Canada. That is because we have the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. We are almost trying to send businesses overseas. 
It doesn’t allow middle class families to keep enough of the money they earn. If you look over the past decade or so, family income really hasn’t risen by that much, yet the cost of living has gone up. So by taking more and more from taxes, it makes it harder for middle class families to make ends meet. So reforming the Tax Code, doing a nice, big tax cut, I think is long overdue. It would be a boon to our economy. You would have a simple system—no more 70,000 pages. Fill out your taxes on a postcard. That not only is more economically efficient, it gives people a lot of peace of mind to know they can do their taxes themselves. It is going to incentivize us to bring all of the trillions of dollars in overseas profits, and bring it back to the United States so that we can invest it here through our companies and create more jobs here. It will make our American businesses more competitive. Our business tax system is outdated. It is uncompetitive. This, I think, will change a lot of that by having a competitive business tax rate, and I think that that will mean more economic growth. So I think all that is pretty obvious to most people who look at this in a fair way. The question for us now is, we have to produce this bill. We have been talking about tax reform for a long time this year, and I think that is great, but it is time right now for us to produce this bill, debate it here in the House, pass it, and send it over to the United States Senate. I am not encouraged when, given the urgency of this, we are going on a recess next week. The House is not going to be here. You are not going to have a tax bill marked up in the Ways and Means Committee or unveiled to the public. Members are not going to be debating that. I think it is time that we do that, and I think there should be a sense of urgency with that. We have got to get our job done. I think the bill should have been passed by now, but let’s get it done. Send it to the Senate. I don’t think you would probably have very smart money to bet that the Senate is going to come through in the clutch. They haven’t shown they can do that yet. But this is going to be a big question for them: Can you get anything done in the U.S. Senate? This is something that we know we need to do. It will be good for our economy. All of the Republicans have said that our Tax Code is a disaster. So if we send them a good bill, this is going to be a major test. Can you apply the majority that the voters gave us? Can you honor your promises and do something good for taxpayers? I hope the answer is yes. But I think in this body we have got to be focusing on, let’s put the Senate to the test. Let’s draft, debate, and pass a strong, bold, tax cut and tax reform. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I always appreciate the contribution that the gentleman makes to the House and to the American people. I could not agree more. For those who may be listening or watching, you may have seen, in the last few months, a heightened energy, or an urgency when it comes to calling out our partners in the Senate to begin to move and to begin to act—not just on things like repealing the healthcare, ObamaCare, but also moving, getting ready to move, hopefully, on tax reform. I know there has been some agreement on the framework, but, as the details continue to be more and more clear, we hope our colleagues on the Senate are ready to move quickly and swiftly for the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ), a brandnew Member who came in from a special election to replace OMB Director Mick Mulvaney when he took the position with President Trump’s administration. He has gotten up to speed quickly and is a huge asset to the Republican Study Committee and to the House Republicans as a whole. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Republican Study Committee’s three promises in 3 months’ pledge to repeal ObamaCare, secure the border, and enable comprehensive tax reform. I applaud RSC’s Chairman Mike Walker for his leadership on this and on this initiative. On the promises to repeal and secure, the House has begun to deliver by passing the American Health Care Act and providing $1.6 billion in border wall funding. Tonight, I want to focus on the third promise: passing comprehensive tax reform. Our Nation’s Tax Code affects every family, business, and worker and is a key driver behind America’s economic competitiveness. Congress has not passed comprehensive tax reform since 1986. That is 31 years. The average cost of a new house then in the United States was $89,430. For a new Ford F–150 pickup truck, the average price was $8,350. Mr. Speaker, it has been way too long before we have taken comprehensive tax reform into consideration. Since then, the number of pages in the IRS code has increased by nearly 50,000 pages. The corporate tax rate is at 35 percent, which is the highest in the industrialized world. Ireland’s, to give you an example, is 12 percent. This is inexcusable. Congress took an important step forward last week through passing a budget resolution, and now it is time for the Senate to do their job on the budget so that we can deliver comprehensive tax reform for the American people. Mr. Speaker, our tax reform plan is both profamily, and proworker. The typical American family will receive a $4,000 pay raise under our plan and will turbocharge the economy through enabling gross domestic product growth to reach 3.2 percent minimum for the next 5 years. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with the House leadership, Chairman BRADY , and all of the congressional Members to pass this fair and simple tax reform package to make this country as great as it can be. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. As you see, three promises, 3 months; October, November, December, three promises, 3 months: repeal, reform, and secure. That is the promise from the Republican Study Committee, making up 157 members, 17 of the 20 chairmen. b1745 Now it is in our ability to make sure this gets through the Senate and passed into law by the President. We can’t force all that, but what we are committed to is doing our part and doing our job to get these pieces of legislation through regular order to the House for a vote to fulfill the promises that most of us ran on over the last several elections. It is also a wonderful privilege tonight to introduce our House veterinarian—the gentleman can define that as he would need if we need a House veterinarian—but the great Representative from central Florida who does fine work in the House, Dr. TEDYOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman’s leadership on this. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the three promises, 3month initiative that you have outlined here, and I think it is so important that we follow through with this. I want to start with tax reform. Members can say: Why do we need tax reform? I think it is selfevident. Our Tax Code, as you heard, is the most burdensome in the world. It stifles economic growth, entrepreneurship, and it creates noncompliance. So we need to simplify it. We have told the American people we were going to do that if we get in charge. I think the repeal of ObamaCare—and some people get offended if we call it ObamaCare, so I will refer to it as the Affordable Care Act. It has disrupted over 20 percent of our economy, and I think it is not affordable. We can talk to so many different people. I know our premiums went up $11,000 since I have come to Congress. In fact, our policy got canceled when I came to Congress because of ObamaCare. Then I think the third part of that is we promised the American people that we would repeal this in its entirety and fix healthcare so that people have access to healthcare, it is affordable, and that it is quality care is the part that gets left out. Then I want to touch on border security. This is something that we have all run on. Any nation needs a secure border. A sovereign nation has to have a secure border, and they have to have control over their border. However, due to the failures of politicians past and present, the U.S. southern border, in particular, remains porous. 
I applaud President Trump for releasing a set of principles which I fully endorse and his priorities that are focused on making our borders more secure. President Trump’s consistent message calling for better enforcement of our immigration laws and improving border security is one of the main reasons he won the Presidency. President Trump is sticking to his campaign promises, which is refreshing to see in Washington, D.C., these days, a town where too many times there is an aversion to making tough decisions in fear of how that will be viewed in the next election. So it is refreshing to see President Trump do what he said he was going to do. Protecting our borders, ending sanctuary cities, and facilitating State and local cooperation in immigration enforcement are commonsense ideas that will protect national security, promote public safety, and deter future illegal immigration. We are hard at work on solving these problems of illegal immigration in the House. Just three real quick facts: From November 2013 to July 2014, officials apprehended 143 individuals listed on the U.S. terrorist watch list trying to cross the Mexican border and enter the U.S. illegally. So many times I hear people say that this is not true and that this does not happen, but we know better. As of 2014, illegal immigrants were convicted and sentenced for about 13 percent of the crimes in the United States. Then, lastly, border security should also focus on maritime domain. Our Coast Guard, a hardworking branch of our military service, has set a new record for cocaine seizures at sea for the second consecutive year, seizing more than 455,000 pounds of cocaine in 2017 that was destined for the homeland. So I am proud to join the Republican Study Committee in recognizing the necessity of border security today. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative YOHO, and we appreciate the gentleman’s work in the United States House. Mr. Speaker, one of the most accomplished men, sometimes a person whom we refer to as ‘‘Governor’’ around here when it comes to political minds, is the gentleman from South Carolina, Representative MARK SANFORD . Week in and week out, he is a very diligent and great leader in this House. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the fine gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ). Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I would make two quick points on the importance of tax reform. One, I would refer to an editorial that appeared in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal. What it talked about was the nexus between deficits and tax reform. Oddly enough, if you look at the numbers here of late and if you look at the 2017 CBO report, what it shows is that, in fact, deficits are creeping up again. Last year’s number is $668 billion. What they point to in this editorial was that a good part of the reason why deficits have escalated has been tied to anemic economic growth and that, unlike other recoveries that had been more robust in nature, the revenues had not come in as they have in past recoveries. As a consequence, deficits have exploded. So if you care about the deficits—and I do, and I know that the gentleman from North Carolina does, and I know that other members of the RSC do. If you care about deficits, then you have got to do something about tax reform this year was, in essence, the premise of the editorial. The other point I would make is this. In a capitalistic society, capital matters. In essence, it is a mathematical formula. Savings drives investment, which drives productivity gain, which ultimately impacts standards of living or wages, which we talk about. There are only two ways of increasing or improving human productivity. One is with gray matter: you can build a better mousetrap because you have been well educated and you can think of something different. The other is with physical capital. One person with a bulldozer can move a lot more dirt than one person with a shovel. Yet what we oftentimes forget in the debate on tax reform is how important it is that we encourage and, in essence, complement the efforts of those who are out there risking on a daily basis. So with that in mind, it is important that we have tax reform that includes people who are actually, again, building businesses. Think about this: the top 25 percent of the earners out there pay 90 percent of the taxes; the top 10 percent pay 60 percent of the taxes. Now, let’s define that for just a second. If you are in the top 25 percent, that begins at $77,000. If you are in the top 10 percent, you are at $133,000. Now, tell me this: When I talk to a truck driver and a schoolteacher at home, their combined income could be around $100,000. Are they rich? I would say no. But they are out there making the kinds of risks that are necessary to the building of capital that was exactly what The Wall Street Journal talked about. If we want to do something about deficits, and if we want to do something about capital formation that is so necessary to raising wages, then we have got to do something about this equation. It is important that those earners and those smallbusiness people not be left out, as is the case right now. That is yet another reason why tax reform is so important this year. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative SANFORD ; I appreciate the gentleman’s good words, experience, and knowledge. Mr. Speaker, speaking of Congress as a whole, it is well past time to make sure that tax reform and tax relief gets across to the American people. A lot of times we talk about classes. The truth is it is probably better terminology to talk about income levels, lower, middle and higher income levels. That is one of the reasons that we are pushing forward the Charitable Giving Act, which is something that impacts both the lower and middle income levels. We believe that is something that needs to be connected to tax reform to make sure that those folks who come from a background of teachers and truck drivers as we just heard about, but also other areas of the middle class and maybe lower income levels, something that they have a way where they are able to make sure that every dollar and every sacrifice they give back to a charitable organization—whether it is a local church or whether it is to the United Way—to make sure that every dollar is counted. This is something that has been going on way too long. As we know, there are 75,000 pages right now of IRS Tax Code regulations. If the IRS wants to come after a private citizen, the private citizen doesn’t have much of a resource ability to fight back whether it is in the legal or whether it is extended wealth. This is a machine that has been building, and the bureaucracy has been growing well past time. It is time to neuter the IRS. One of the ways we can do that is reducing it from seven tax brackets down to three. It was erroneously shared by somebody across the aisle recently that we are driving up the lowest bracket from 10 percent to 12 percent. The truth is this: we are condensing it right now to three tax brackets—35 percent, 25 percent, and 12 percent—and doubling the standard deduction from $12,000 to $24,000. This is something that we are looking forward to doing to benefit the American people. We talk much in these Halls about bipartisan support or bipartisan this or that. When did it become an issue, when did it become a problem, and when did it become a point of contention to allow the American people to keep more of the money from the hard work they put in day in and day out, week in and week out? That is something that we must do. That is something that should not even be a place of argument or a place of debate when it comes back allowing these folks to continue. For some, we can get past the tax credit language. We can move on beyond the charitable deductions and all the different political and accounting words. What about just the family of four that needs another car, that needs to be able to afford a car payment to get a mom or a dad back and forth to work, or maybe a teenager in the house? We have been through that twice now. We had more claims than we probably should, but we get it. But also, maybe it is a few more times out to eat or to the movies, the things that 
make you want to get up every day and continue to pursue that American Dream. But not only from the individual side of this—certainly very important—but what about this corporate tax rate, this business rate that we talk constantly about that almost has become Washington jargon talking points? Why is that so important? Over the years since the 1930s and 1940s, our corporate business rate has climbed to the highest in the industrial world. Why is that? Why would we make it tougher on our manufacturers and our companies to have a higher tax rate? What incentive is it to stay here? We could track company after company. I come from the State of North Carolina where textiles and furniture used to be two of our top three job providers. A lot of those companies now you will find in Vietnam or other places. That corporate tax rate that literally has gone through the roof, why wouldn’t we want to reduce that business rate? Why wouldn’t we want to incentivize companies to begin to bring those jobs back to the United States? I think it is crucial, and I think it is something that all of us should have the energy and the ability to be able to get behind and really push forward. We have been promising this for how long? Since 1986? I was a junior in high school. Thirtyone years this has been on the docket, and the moment is now for us to deliver. If it is not now, as Reagan used to say, then when? Then how? What should we be doing if it is not fulfilling the very promise that we have made to the American people, and that is that we are going to provide genuine—not some kind of phony legislation, not some kind of showboat, but genuine tax reform and tax relief for the American people? Now, you may hear sometimes that, hey, the Republican plan is only for the most wealthy. Let’s look at the numbers. Let’s put a little math equation up, if we could, please. Let’s say that the most wealthy—if you are talking about somebody who makes $1 million, let’s say we reduce their taxes by 1 percent. My math that I am doing here in my mind, that comes to about $10,000. Let’s say, if you go to that middleincome family, two parents working as hard as they can, they are bringing about $50,000 a year annually, yet their tax break, their tax benefit is 10 percent. Now, math tells me that is only $5,000 compared to the $10,000. So you may hear the spin from time to time, well, the wealthier are getting the higher tax break, the wealthier are getting the higher tax credit. Listen, when it comes to dollar for dollar, the impact that that makes to the middle and lower income families is drastic. I will tell you this. Every time we turn around, every time that each Member goes back and forth to his district, he is hearing the same message: ‘‘Get something done.’’ Tax reform is one of those areas where, specifically, we are being compelled, we are being urged, and we are being called. My fellow Members in the House, please hear those urgent voices right now. Even if Members want to move past the tax relief and the humanitarian component, is it not politically strategic for us to do what we have promised to do on behalf of the American people? As I said in my opening, I am confident that the American people will deliver the final grade over the next 3 months. The 115th Congress, what kind of grade will we have over the next 3 months if we do not deliver on these three promises? I am hoping that that urgency is resonating. Repealing and replacing, continuing to fight to repeal and replace ObamaCare, to make sure that we are continuing to reform and do everything that we can to reform the Tax Code. Finally, the promise that we have been making year after year is to make sure that we are protecting the American people by securing our border. I understand that each of these items is a major legislative item in its own right. To be frank, we should have been delivering on them throughout the year. It is October, the 10th month of year. It is high past time. We only have such a busy agenda this late in the game because we haven’t delivered on our promises. b1800 I want to thank my colleagues and fellow Republican Study Committee members tonight for joining us this evening. I would ask the American people to continue to support and continue to urge their Members of Congress to deliver on these promises. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
REAUTHORIZE CHIP The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress, as a father, and as a grandfather, nothing I do is more important than ensuring every child in Arizona and America has the opportunity to live up to their Godgiven potential. No matter where they live, kids deserve to grow up healthy, with every chance to succeed. That is why it is beyond unacceptable that, for the first time ever, Congress missed the deadline to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program. For decades, CHIP has been a bipartisan program and has been reauthorized with broad support, until now. It has now been 11 days since CHIP expired. This is an outrage for children across the Nation who depend on the affordable, quality care they receive, thanks to CHIP. It is especially troubling for Arizona. Arizona has had the unfortunate distinction of being one of the worst States for healthcare access for children. Until last year, it was the only State in the entire Nation without an active Children’s Health Insurance Program. Arizona froze CHIP KidsCare program in 2010. At its height, the waiting list for coverage after the freeze topped 100,000. I repeat: the list topped 100,000 because of a freeze put on by the State of Arizona. Two years ago, Congress reauthorized CHIP and included enhanced match rate funding for States under the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to advocates on the ground and with bipartisan support in our State legislature, this enhanced funding finally paved the way for our State to reopen KidsCare. Last year, KidsCare began enrolling children—over 23,000 so far. We have just begun the hard work of educating and reaching out to the working families who qualify for coverage. Arizona is one of a handful of States, as you can see here in this chart in blue, that would run out of Federal funds to cover children by December of this year, absent congressional action. Families in these States are the most at risk for losing critical access to care, until Congress steps up to the plate and passes a robust reauthorization with enhanced rate funding. I have met and heard from many of these families and their providers. I know what is it stake for them. Cate Arnquist is a mother from Tucson, Arizona, whose 8yearold son, Zachary, was approved for coverage through KidsCare last month. This is a huge relief to Cate, who recently moved to Arizona with her husband and works at a local elementary school. Cate said: It’s important for me to know that if I need to take him to the doctor, I will be able to take him. As a parent, your kids are always your biggest priority. I think every parent wants to make sure their kids are healthy. 
Cate, I couldn’t agree with you more. Kids like Zachary deserve to know that their elected officials here in Congress are looking out for them. Graciela is a working single mom who lives in Phoenix. Her 17yearold daughter, who suffers from high blood pressure, relies on KidsCare coverage. Graciela says: 
I just pray and ask everybody who is behind CHIP to think about it. They don’t know how hard it is sometimes when you are a parent and you don’t know what to do. Should I put a plate of food on the table or should I take my kid to the doctor? 
These are questions no parent in Arizona or in America should have to ask themselves. Doctors in our community agree. A pediatrician practicing in Gilbert, Arizona, shared an important story 
with us about a family with five children in her practice. The father works as a grocer, but makes $20 too much to qualify for Medicaid. That is $20. One of the children has significant developmental delays and another child has a serious neurological disease. After the youngest child was born, it became clear that he most likely had the neurological disease as well. The doctor referred this child for evaluation, but the family was unable to take him to the neurologist because they could not afford the office visits and diagnostic testing necessary. Had KidsCare been open at the time, the family could have applied for coverage, since they qualified, based on their income. This story and our experience in Arizona should be a cautionary tale for the rest of the States who may freeze their program if Congress fails to reauthorize CHIP now. No family should be put at risk when they need help for their kids. Working families like these are doing their best to make ends meet and raise healthy kids. Reauthorizing CHIP isn’t just the right thing to do morally, but it is the smart, economic decision for our communities. I understood that when I was a Republican State legislator and fought for KidsCare, and I understand it now here in Congress. We all know that when children have meaningful access to quality, affordable, comprehensive healthcare coverage, our schools, families, and our State’s bottom line all win. Healthy kids have a better shot in school and grow up to be healthy adults. When we invest in them, when we invest in their families, we are investing in their futures and our future. We must do better. Instead of playing partisan games and spending time on bills that make coverage and affordability worse for Americans, we need to make CHIP reauthorization front and center of our focus. While I am pleased that the Senate Finance Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee have started to take up action, it is past time to get a robust bill to the President’s desk. CHIP has long been a bipartisan program, and I will keep working with anyone, regardless of office or party, to make sure our kids have the care they deserve. They are counting on us. We cannot let them down. I am pleased to be joined this evening by my colleagues who are committed to fighting for kids in our communities. I want to thank them for joining this Special Order hour to fight for CHIP and a strong reauthorization process. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding and for his leadership in organizing this Special Order hour. There is no more sacred responsibility that we have than to ensure that the children in this country have access to quality, affordable healthcare. So I rise this evening to speak in support of the vital Children’s Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP. As you know, Mr. Speaker, CHIP authorization expired on September 30, 2017—this past September. This program assures that 9 million children, including 27,000 children and pregnant women in my home State of Rhode Island, are provided with lowcost health insurance, which covers essential services such as routine checkups, immunizations, doctor visits, prescriptions, dental and vision care, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, laboratory and xray services, and emergency services. This historically bipartisan program has been successful in lowering the percentage of children who are uninsured from nearly 14 percent when it started in 1997 to 4.5 percent in 2015. Historic achievements. If not extended by Congress soon, many States will no longer be able to fund the program and will begin limiting coverage, some as early as the end of this year. In fact, the Kaiser Family Foundation recently concluded that, without an extension of CHIP, ‘‘States would face budget pressures, children would lose coverage, and implementation of program changes could result in increased costs and administrative burden for States as well as confusion for families.’’ If not extended by Congress soon, many States will no longer be able to fund the program and will begin limiting coverage. Congress must also act with urgency to extend and reauthorize the other programs that were enacted in the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, including extending funding for community health centers; the Personal Responsibility Education Program; the rural and Medicaredependent hospitals program; Teaching Health Centers; Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program; and the Special Diabetes Program for type 1 diabetes and for Indians. These critical programs, as well as CHIP, are vital to the American healthcare system, and they support access to highquality, affordable care. I want to again thank the gentleman from Arizona for providing this Special Order. This is urgent and should be an urgent priority for the Congress of the United States to reauthorize this critical program to absolutely insist that children—as I said, 9 million children across this country—have access to quality, affordable healthcare, including 27,000 children and pregnant women in my home State. Democrats are urging our Republican colleagues to reauthorize this bill immediately so that the families who are so anxious about whether or not they will continue to have the ability to access quality, affordable healthcare can rest comfortably and know that this work is done. I thank the gentleman again for his leadership and for yielding to me on this very important issue. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for caring about our Nation’s children. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ). Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I think it is a new low for this Congress to allow the critical and bipartisan Children’s Health Insurance Program to expire. This program is 20 years old, and this has never happened, where we have allowed the basic safety net healthcare program for children to expire. We hear over and over again, Mr. Speaker, you talk about the ne’er do well, lazy ones of our constituents who are poor and don’t want to work. But, Mr. Speaker, these are children who are ineligible for work and unavailable to take care of themselves. We are destroying the health safety net for children. But it is not that we haven’t had time to extend CHIP. We have renamed post offices. We have renamed a highway. We have advanced the House budget reconciliation riddled with unpaid tax cuts for the wealthy, including the repeal of the estate tax, which alone would increase our deficit by $269 billion by 2025. Mr. Speaker, that is billion with a B. Are Republicans in this body trying to solve the budget crisis and our deficit problem by cutting CHIP? I don’t think so. Even more, Mr. Speaker, last week, we spent a considerable amount of time debating the 20week abortion ban. We heard passionate speeches about how important it was to preserve the life of fetuses. We spent all this time and speaker after speaker making emotional demands on this body that we restrict women’s body autonomy, but we spent no time reauthorizing the program for little Junior, once he crowns and is born—the basic healthcare that he needs immediately exiting the womb. b1815 Mr. Speaker, simply put, it is hypocritical for you to say that life ends as soon as the umbilical cord is cut. And, Mr. Speaker, your actions prove it. You know, I am of the mindset of one of our news reporters, Rachel Maddow, that we ought to just watch what you do and not what you say. Almost 9 million children depend on CHIP for healthcare; 9 million children from low to moderateincome families who will lose access to vaccinations, routine checkups, dental care, mental healthcare, prescriptions, and some of these children are profoundly disabled. Mr. Speaker, what is going to happen to the 24 percent of the children enrolled in CHIP that have special 
healthcare needs, including asthma and learning disabilities? The health of our children depends on this program, yet, Mr. Speaker, all you can do to muster up a reauthorization for CHIP is to fund it by increasing Medicare premiums—Medicare, a program designed for people over 65—and cutting the Prevention and Public Health Fund. All you can do, Mr. Speaker, is to pit old people against our babies in order to provide basic healthcare to children. This sounds really Faustian, and it is unimaginable, yet this is the reality that we are working with. Mr. Speaker, it is now time to put these politics aside and to reauthorize CHIP now for 5 years. This is a disgrace not only in this Nation, but internationally. I, as an American, don’t want to be judged by putting our kids last. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin for her comments. Mr. Speaker, I am kind of new to this body, but when I came here, I came with the same intention as I did when I first got into the Arizona State Legislature. One of the first issues I worked on was this program, a program that helped kids stay healthy, a program so that they could be successful at school, a program that is imperative. Yet, today, millions of people around this country, millions of families around this country are asking themselves: What are they going to do about my children’s health? What is going to happen? Who is going to be there for my child? When I was a police officer, I had, sadly, the ability to see people in poverty day in and day out, what it meant to their families, but especially what sick children look like, what it means to see children taken out of homes in ambulances instead of having preventative care, what it means for a child to have to be in a hospital instead of having had the ability to have preventative care, what it means to a child with disabilities to have to go through that process and not have the physical therapy that is needed. This happened time and time again before CHIP became reality. I don’t think America wants to go back there. I think America wants to move forward and make sure our children are healthy and able to withstand the issues in our society that lead us to make sure that they do. I cannot understand, for the life of me, why we would keep these families—it is 11 days now. It is going to mean many more. We will have to find some level of agreement. Yet, as was just mentioned by the gentlewoman from Wisconsin, we are funding this by taking money away from the elderly, from those also in need, from those also at risk. I have to say that when I patrolled the streets of Chicago, I did so to make sure that people were saved and safe. And I can’t believe that I have come to this body and found out that we are willing to keep these families waiting, we are willing to sit back and not understand the core issues of what it means to those families to have to suffer through this process of the unknown of their child’s future healthcare. I have to say that this is an issue that most Americans and most of this body agree to. I don’t know why we have gone down this path of taking money—or thinking of taking money away from the elderly. It is wrong. But I do know that we should get this dealt with quickly and make sure the families in America that need it can provide for their children’s health. Mr. Speaker, I yield to Representative LANGEVIN , the gentleman from Rhode Island. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate all his time and effort he is putting into bringing attention to this vital issue. It is an honor to join him this evening as we highlight the imminent need to pass a full reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Now, I represent the great State of Rhode Island, a State with over 27,000 children and pregnant women at risk of losing healthcare if CHIP is not fully funded. It is deeply troubling to me and many of my constituents, my colleagues in government; and we fought hard over the years to make sure that we did better by our young people, by the most vulnerable, and by pregnant women in making sure that they had the healthcare coverage that they desperately need and deserve. Now, in Rhode Island, the lack of a reauthorization endangers $26 million in Federal funds that support this vulnerable population, many of whom will not otherwise have comprehensive coverage. This is particularly frustrating because congressional Republicans knew that CHIP funding would expire on September 30. They had ample time to fix this problem in a bipartisan way and have chosen not to. Instead of proactively crafting legislation to ensure 9 million lowincome children and families maintain access to affordable, highquality healthcare, Republicans focused their efforts on gutting the Affordable Care Act to the exclusion of everything else. Now, in the service of their political priority to eliminate coverage for 23 million, they are passing on an opportunity to govern on multiple healthcare fronts. Rather than work to find meaningful bipartisan solutions, Republicans still seek ways of systematically unraveling ACA protections and have only offered untenable options to offset the cost of CHIP. That is no way to govern responsibly or to even remotely do it in a bipartisan way, which they could do. Now, their plan to pay for healthcare for one population by stripping access to healthcare from another is wrong. This approach of robbing Peter to pay Paul does nothing to build a foundation for a healthier future, nor does it protect the communities with sufficient healthcare access today. Proposing to slash the ACA’s Prevention and Public Health Fund and creating a greater financial burden on seniors by suggesting destructive Medicare changes are not acceptable ways to bring Democrats to the table and pass a CHIP reauthorization with bipartisan support. Which, by the way, I am sure my colleagues have mentioned as they were speaking tonight, when CHIP was first authorized, it was done collaboratively in a bipartisan way at a contentious time in Congress, back when it was first enacted. But they found a way to do the right thing for vulnerable individuals, particularly our children, and we need to come together again. We have a responsibility to move quickly, to ensure our children continue to have access to highquality, affordable coverage. States like Rhode Island deserve to know that we will support the efforts to provide for the children in the State. The health professionals who treat these children deserve more certainty. Most importantly, the children who benefit from CHIP deserve much better than to be threatened with coverage termination because my colleagues in the majority can’t set aside their political ambitions and goals. Mr. Speaker, I just want to again thank my colleague for raising an alarm bell on this issue, calling attention and focusing the American people on the need to reauthorize CHIP. We take great pride in Rhode Island that over the years we have built a very strong program to cover vulnerable children and pregnant women. We have been leaders in the country in having a very low rate of uninsured. Going back even before the ACA was enacted, we had a model program with our Rite Care and Rite Share program. There were hardfought battles that moved the ball forward for providing better and more responsible health coverage for the people who need it and deserve it the most. We need to come together now in a bipartisan way to make sure that CHIP is reauthorized. We cannot let this program fail. We cannot fail our children, our most vulnerable populations. We can come together in a bipartisan way. Democrats stand ready to do just that, come together in a bipartisan way to reauthorize CHIP, just as it had been authorized in a bipartisan way when it was first created. Now, I know that there are many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who care as passionately about covering lowincome children, providing affordable healthcare, doing the right thing by our children, and I look forward to reaching out across the aisle to do just that. Let’s do this in a bipartisan way. Let’s do the right thing and put partisan politics aside and cover our children. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank again Mr. O’HALLERAN for his leadership on this vital issue, and I look forward to continuing to work with him as we reauthorize CHIP, hopefully in the very near future. Again, we got to do this together. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Rhode Island not only for his discussion today, but also for all his work on behalf of the children of America. I think that his record speaks for itself, and it is obvious that what we just heard came from his heart. So I thank the gentleman for his remarks. I asked my fellow colleagues, when they start to work on this bill again— hopefully, they do it in a speedy fashion—that when they wake up in the morning, they think of what it means to have their child potentially without healthcare, what it means to have the unknown that we don’t know if next month or the month later they will lose that coverage because Congress has failed to address the issue that they have all agreed on for 20 years. We have to and we must find a way to come to agreement. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. NORMAN ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend, Mr. HIGGINS from Louisiana. 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise unscripted to bring to the attention of the entire Nation the plight of the good citizens of Louisiana who were impacted by Hurricane Harvey last month. Beside me at this graph shows the rainfall, the water event of Hurricane Harvey as it impacted Texas and Louisiana. b1830 As anyone can see, it was a tremendous water event, unprecedented rainfall, that overwhelmed any water management system. And, as anyone can see, the parishes of southwest Louisiana were impacted, as well as many counties in Texas, yet, as we discuss disaster relief, Louisiana is absent from our conversation. I point out, to all who would choose to witness, the State line of Louisiana, as defined by the Sabine River, and the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Harvey did not recognize the artificial State boundaries that we have created as a Republic, nor should we as we provide disaster relief for our citizens. Just after Hurricane Harvey had impacted Texas and Louisiana, my office drafted a letter to the executive branch to a President that I admire and respect, advising him of the impact, and begging his expedited approval of the disaster status once the formal request had been submitted by our Governor. Sometime later, just 2 weeks ago, that formal request was submitted by the Governor of our State. Just after that submission, my office drafted and submitted a second letter requesting expedited approval of disaster status for these citizens of Louisiana, who were clearly just as impacted by this storm as many citizens in Texas. Tomorrow, we shall send a third letter, this time signed by the entire Louisiana delegation. I ask that the Nation recognize the plight of the people I represent. The good and patriotic citizens of southwest Louisiana are suffering. I respect and admire my President, I support him, I have supported him since day one, and I support him still. But it is important that we, as representatives of we the people, communicate clearly our intent and our service. I beg that the leaders of the executive branch level would witness this clear evidence of the need for disaster declaration of the parishes of southwest Louisiana. And I beg that this message is received with the spirit with which it is delivered, which is respectful, yet in determined service of the citizens whom I have sworn to represent. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding these precious moments to me. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we had some interesting days here, but, over the weekend, being back in Texas, I am hearing the cries from people all over east Texas. There is a small number that say: Hey, I am not making much, and I am getting a subsidy from the government, so I am okay on my healthcare, I am young, I have no health problems, and that is fine. But over and over, there is a cry going out around America that says: We elected Republicans in the majority in the House and the majority in the Senate to help us with our healthcare— with really health insurance. Everybody can get healthcare. You can just go to the emergency room, whether you have money or not. This is really more about health insurance. Some of us have not wanted health insurance to make our major decisions for us on our own healthcare. We haven’t wanted the government to make major decisions on our healthcare, but both are making those decisions for people across the country today. Unfortunately, there are people telling me they are paying $8,000, $10,000, $12,000. I heard one for $20,000 yesterday from Texas, $20,000 for the family’s insurance, and they have a $12,000 deductible, and they can’t afford either one. They expected help. President Trump is not the Congress. He has pushed, shoved, cajoled, done everything he could to try to get Congress moving in the House after a back and forth, wailing, gnashing of teeth. We got a bill. It wasn’t perfect by any stretch. But at least it would have given people relief from high premiums, most Americans. Hopefully, Republicans won’t misrepresent the truth, as some did. Actually, we know some people just flat lied about ObamaCare. People who said, ‘‘If you like your insurance, you can keep it,’’ they knew it was a lie. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. They knew that was a lie. And now the people are suffering the consequences of trusting people in government who lied to them. They were deceived. But even with all the deception, most of the time it appeared that a clear majority of Americans did not want what was fraudulently called the Affordable Care Act. There was nothing affordable about it, unless you didn’t have any healthcare problems at all. People who are carrying the weight of the taxes in this country have needed help. They counted on us to provide legislative changes, repeal of ObamaCare, let’s put a system in place where people can make their own healthcare decisions, and we sent the bill to the Senate, and I still believe we should have been demanding more of the Senate every day. I know there are a lot of people who say: Well, Republicans can’t lose the majority in the Senate because there are a bunch more Democrats whose seats are up this time instead of Republicans. Yes, we can lose the majority, even when there are more Democratic seats up for election. That is what happens when people are sorely disappointed. Many stay home, and the wrong people will get elected when too many people stay home. But the adage is, still true, democracy ensures people are governed no better than they deserve. So whether anybody liked or disliked President Obama as our President—and, by the way, for those who like to throw out the term ‘‘hater,’’ I don’t hate anybody, but I can certainly disapprove of conduct. For 8 years, America deserved Barack Hussein Obama. Before that, whether you like him or not, I like him, America deserved George W. Bush. Before that, America deserved 8 years of William Clinton—I forget his middle name. Before that, 4 years of George H. W. Bush. Before that, 8 years of Ronald Reagan. And I am very pleased that America deserved Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton last November. It is interesting, though, being in hearings today and hear people clambering that they demand action from this department, that department, it is taking too long, while, at that very moment, Democratic Senators at the other end of this building are doing everything they can to prevent confirmation of President Trump’s appointees 
to those departments so they can start getting things done. It is amazing when one party like that can hold the ability, because of the filibuster rule, because of the requirement for 60 votes, apparently, they are able to hold up these appointees. To me, that is all the reason to go ahead and say: Do you know what, you are demanding action from people who you have not confirmed yet, so we are not going to let you play that game anymore. You have people saying, ‘‘Oh, my goodness, these departments aren’t getting decisions made, aren’t getting their work done,’’ and all the while you are holding them back from being able to do it by not confirming the people who need to be doing that work. The Senate ought to just say: We are not playing that game, we are not letting you play that game, we are going to call the game off, we are going to get serious about America’s problems, and we are going to confirm President Trump’s nominees with 51 votes, not just judges, we are going to confirm his nominees with 51 votes. We cannot tolerate people—really it is fraudulent activity to hold back the nominees from being confirmed and then vilify the administration for not getting the work done that those nominees who hadn’t been confirmed will have to do. The Senate needs to respond. The Senate did not respond to the bill we sent to them. That was quite interesting. In my 12 years here, I have never seen a situation like that, Mr. Speaker, where some of us got calls from people in the Senate who don’t normally get calls, and that included people from the Tuesday Group, the Freedom Caucus, the Republican Study Committee, and the Republican leadership. They all were asking the same question: Okay, would you please promise us that if we pass this healthcare bill in the Senate that you will not take it up and pass it in the House? Because it is only if you guys promise us, the Republicans promise us, you won’t pass the bill that we have down here—apparently, it was so bad— that we will let it go to committee, or you will amend it, but you just promise us you won’t pass the bill if we pass it. Well, as far as I know, everybody I talked to gave reassurance to the Senators who called them and said: No, we promise, we won’t pass your bill, it is terrible, we won’t, we can assure you. Even with those assurances, just the effort to get something passed so that we can come together in a conference between House conferees and Senate conferees, just to come together for the chance—this bill that the Senate was taking up to have some skinny repeal, they called it, of ObamaCare, and at least some measure of change to the suffering that people are enduring right now, and they still couldn’t get 51 votes, which is all they needed under the reconciliation process. Even when they were assured: We promise you, we won’t pass this bill, you will get another chance to vote, just help the process, let’s get it to conference, so we can get some relief to the American people who are suffering, suffering so much that they would go so far as to give us the majority in the Senate after they have given us the majority in the House, and give us the White House as a Republican Party— incredible. But the American people are still suffering. And the budget apparently does not provide for ObamaCare to be repealed and replaced under reconciliation for the next 12 months. So unless the Senate feels enough heat from the American people—the Republicans that is—they are not going to do anything about ObamaCare that they promise to repeal and replace. b1845 Apparently, it is going to have to get pretty hot in the kitchen down in the Senate to get people down there worked up enough to finally give the American people the relief that the Senate Republicans promised. Now, I don’t like talking about this, despite what some may think. It is much nicer to get along and go along, but people are suffering because we haven’t kept our promise. The Senate couldn’t pass anything that would get the American people some relief from all the suffering from ObamaCare. For those who are not aware, yes, there were bailouts for the monopoly insurance companies. Some made record profits, and yet they are still, under ObamaCare, the way it was written, supposed to get bailouts. So it appears pretty clear the design of ObamaCare was to make it fail. Apparently, people at the top of some of these insurance companies have not been smart enough to figure out that they signed their own death warrants when they embraced ObamaCare, but it appears it was designed to make people angry at the greedy, allegedly corrupt health insurance companies. I don’t think they are corrupt, but there sure was a lot of greed there between some of the pharmaceutical companies and the health insurance companies signing on. Some of them tried to say: Well, oh, but we needed to be at the table. We are going: Not if you are on the menu you didn’t want to be at the table. I am sure the executives that have their golden parachutes leave the health insurance companies after 5, 6, 7 years with their incomes. The design was the health insurance companies make a fortune, people’s premiums kept going through the roof, deductibles kept going through the roof, bailouts were provided to insurance companies that had record profits, and then the design ultimately would be the American people getting so angry that they would lash out and say: Enough already. I never thought I would say this, but anything has got to be better than these insurance companies, the handful that are left, so let’s just let the government take care of everything. Then we get a system that is twice as bad as the VA for all Americans, so all Americans can suffer fairly, equally, instead of getting what used to be some of the best healthcare ever in the history of the world. We have another issue I want to touch on. Our Taxed Enough Already Caucus had a meeting yesterday and heard from Luke Rosiak, who has done more investigation on the IT scandal here on Capitol Hill, apparently done more investigation than anybody at the FBI. We keep hearing rumors that the FBI is reporting there is nothing to this, kind of like the Clinton scandal, the money that the Clinton Foundation got from the stockholders of Uranium One—she approves the sale of 20, 25 percent of America’s uranium production; it ends up going to the Russians—the email scandal, that obviously there were efforts to destroy and obfuscate evidence that was being sought, and Comey went out of his way to protect Ms. Clinton. There is just so much there that needs to be investigated. The Attorney General apparently can’t investigate because of his own recusal. Mr. Rosenstein is sure not going to investigate it and thinks Mueller will do it. Mueller is disqualified from doing it. Although he is such a problem, he will not disqualify himself. Comey is a material witness—should be—in the investigation. As the Washingtonian reported back in 2013 in this long expose they did on glorifying Mr. Comey and Mr. Mueller’s relationship, that Comey knows that basically, in essence, if the world were on fire, the one person who would be there with him, protecting him, standing with him, would be Mr. Mueller. Mueller cannot investigate anything in which Comey is a witness. He can’t. So what does he do? Comey goes and hires more lawyers. He has already had more lawyers than anybody I am aware of—ever. He is already exceeding the very general charge he got, going back years before he needed to. I mean, this is just incredible. They were a problem 10 years ago. The Obama administration had 8 years to get into it. Mueller, as FBI Director, had plenty of time to get into it. So there is only one thing we can be looking at, and that is a vendetta by Robert Mueller after some people. He is clearly disqualified. Comey is in it up to his eyeballs. We have got to have a special prosecutor that will look into the matters that should be investigated. Then we have this issue on Capitol Hill. We need to know how compromised our computer system, our IT system on the Hill has been. We had a guy named Imran Awan working on Capitol Hill, started working with Democrats’ computer systems 
12 years or so ago. He was not even an American citizen at the time. Apparently, if there has ever been a background check on Imran Awan, it certainly was not adequate, because in the Imran Awan family and cohorts, you have got bankruptcy; you have got massive indebtedness; there was money received by one of the team, $100,000 or so, from a known consort with Hezbollah. Then we find out yesterday—or I did; I had not heard of this before—that Imran Awan, for parts of the year, would not even be here in Washington. He would be in Pakistan servicing up to dozens of our Democratic colleagues’ computer systems from Pakistan, making the maximum that somebody working on Capitol Hill could by working for different Members of Congress, and then you add the partial salaries together until you get around $160,000. We heard yesterday that as he would get one person up to $160,000 working for different offices, then they would add another to the payroll and get them up to $160,000. One of the group owed another individual $100,000. So with no indication that that individual who was owed $100,000 ever even came to Capitol Hill or did any work here, he got put on the House payroll and made a couple hundred thousand dollars in return for the hundred thousand that he had loaned to one of the Awan team. It is just almost inconceivable that we would have someone working with some of the highest privileged material. It seems to me the courts made it clear the speech or debate privilege to protect constituent information, information that people provide to us as whistleblowers, that that is probably more constitutionally protected than the attorneyclient privilege. It is that important. Yet knowing there are countries, there are companies that would pay large amounts of money to know some Members of Congress’ schedule, have access to all their emails, see what they are saying about different bills, what they want to do, that is some valuable stuff. And yet, in some years, we were told yesterday, that Imran Awan was servicing Capitol Hill computers from Pakistan. Now, I don’t know how secure the Pakistani internet systems are, but it is kind of hard to believe that the American interests would be as protected in Pakistan and the Capitol congressional computer system would be protected as it is going through the Pakistani internet to be serviced. We also heard that Imran Awan, from some of the emails that WikiLeaks put out—we don’t know if he worked for the Democratic National Committee when they were hacked, but we know there were emails where someone was saying: We need to get into the chairwoman’s laptop. We need her password. Oh, well, Imran Awan has all of her passwords, so check with him. So we don’t know the extent that he could have compromised things, with all the indebtedness he had and the car dealership that he never reported. Anybody that makes over $120,000 from Capitol Hill has to report any outside income. He never reported those things. In fact, it appears to be a crime when he failed to even report that he had his wife on the payroll making money on Capitol Hill in those financial disclosures he filed. We also know that he had some history of violence complaints. His step mother complained of being kidnapped by him and forced to sign documents that would turn over money and property that Imran’s father supposedly had coming. We know that he has now been indicted simply on a bank fraud charge for lying in order to get a bank loan, the money from which was sent overseas. We also learned that they were sending technological equipment over to Pakistan. They were fraudulently filing vouchers showing that $800 iPads only cost under $500 so they wouldn’t have to be listed on inventory. That obviously makes things more easy to steal. There were reports, in fact, by the person who rented his house when he and his wife appeared to flee—he was trying to flee when he was stopped at the airport. There were hard drives, all kinds of things. We know that he and possibly some of those working—maybe they didn’t work. We don’t know. But $6 million to $7 million was paid to him and his family and his cohorts during the time they were working here, and yet he was downloading from Members of Congress’ clouds or from their own servers all of their information into a spot where people who weren’t authorized could access those Members of Congress’ accounts. This has got to be investigated more thoroughly than it has been. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
b1900 HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) for 30 minutes. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, it is Hispanic Heritage Month, and I want to take this time to honor some great heroes in my district of Hispanic descent, who range from reporters to civil rights heroes, to community organizers, to businessmen and women, and I am just proud to be here tonight to be able to do that. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, the first gentleman I want to talk about is Daniel Barajas, the executive director of the Young American Dreamers. Daniel Barajas was born in Winter Haven, Florida, to a family of migrant workers. Growing up, he worked in the orange groves of Florida. There, he witnessed firsthand how farmworkers were exposed to dangerous pesticides while working for poverty wages. He also learned about the longterm effects of failed immigration policies, seeing his own father be deported during a local operation. As a teenager, Daniel saw his friends join gangs to survive poverty and defend themselves against deeply rooted racism within their communities. He joined this path but was dubbed ‘‘Lucky’’ because he survived. Barajas dropped out of school in the ninth grade but earned his GED in 2001. During an incarceration in 2009, he noticed that inmates had no access to books or to reading glasses. It was then that Daniel founded the Library of Hope to collect books and reading glasses to donate to inmates. Daniel’s younger sister, Maria Isabel, founded the Young American Dreamers, YAD, in 2010 to help local immigrant youth. Maria Isabel passed away in a car accident, tragically, in 2012, and to honor her legacy, Daniel joined YAD and was voted executive director in 2013. Barajas also continues to fundraise for annual scholarships to local students and participates in philanthropic events in the community. Daniel now speaks at high schools across Polk County, talks to students about his life, and shows them that one is not defined by their past, and that breaking down barriers is possible. He also closely works with the Polk County Supervisor of Elections Office to help register voters, increase voter turnout, and distribute clemency applications to help felons restore their civil rights. Daniel is an example of one who could turn their life around and benefit the community as a whole, and he works with the Mexican Consulate in Orlando to do community workshops to teach immigrant families of their constitutional rights. Thank you, Daniel, for your contributions. HONORING ERICKA GOMEZ TEJEDA  
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, next is Ericka GomezTejeda with Vamos4PR, Florida chapter. She is the civic engagement coordinator at 32BJ SEIU.

Upon her return to the U.S. 2 years later, she moved to Florida and was elected vice president of SEIU Local 1199 United Health Care Workers East for the Florida nursing home division, representing 11,000 nursing home workers in the State. In 2014, under the leadership of 32BJ President Hector Figueroa, Ericka returned to the Local 32BJ as deputy director of the 12,000member New York 
City security division, leading the field of operation for the division’s first citywide contracts. In 2016, Ericka moved back to Florida and became the 32BJ civic engagement coordinator and organizer of Vamos4PR, Florida division.

Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, next I would like to highlight Esteban Garces, Florida State director of Mi Familia Vota. Esteban directs the Florida operation of Mi Familia Vota, managing strategy, operations, local policy development, campaigns, civic engagement, organizing efforts, and nonpartisan electoral work. Esteban’s career was set in motion at an early age as a victim of landlord abuse. Continued exposure to immigration, education, and racial injustices spurred his interest in social justice. He began his career in social justice organizing, and then electoral organizing. He joined Mi Familia Vota in 2015 to continue working to create positive change. He was previously the immigration campaign director for SEIU Local 615. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, next I would like to honor Frank Lopez of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Central Florida. Frank Lopez is the president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Metro Orlando.

Lopez has been successful in creating substantive underwriting support to develop and sustain innovative youth learning and entrepreneurship services. These programs have produced an impressive array of communitybuilding benefits, such as workforce readiness and leadership development, youth entrepreneurship experimental training camps, mentoring and coaching programs, communitybased technology, and wealthbuilding programs. Lopez served as a member of the U.S. Hispanic Council on Federal Employment that advises the Director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on strategies for improving access of Latinos to the Federal workforce.

Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, next I would like to honor Ingrid Morfa, immigrant, attorney, and activist, a leader in immigration law in central Florida. Ingrid Morfa is an attorney and first generation American. Her parents migrated from the Dominican Republic in the 1970s.

Her studies at Harvard University, Barry University School of Law, Cambridge College in the U.K., Kaplan University, and the New York City of Technology College have equipped Ingrid Morfa to help those around her. As a member of the National Caribbean Leadership Team and the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida, an advocate for domestic violence prevention with Nuevo Sendero, and an attorney who assisted more than 2,000 naturalization applicants and dozens of green card applicants who are victims of domestic violence and crime at no cost, she has shown a devotion to the community that is only surpassed by her love that she has for her family. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, next I would like to honor Jimmy Torres, community organizer and activist, and also a major member of the SEIU union. Jimmy Torres Velez grew up in Puerto Rico, where he went to public school.

Since then, he has worked for various unions in many States and in Puerto Rico. In those years he has held various positions, including trustee, secretarytreasurer, organizing director, and AFL–CIO State director. As part of his work, he has created and developed relationships with various Puerto Rican communities. After years organizing public and private sector employees, Jimmy organized and managed the State legislative office for SEIU in Puerto Rico and cooperated with the establishment of the legislative coordinating body for the AARP as well. After moving to Florida to help with retired members of the Service Employees International Union, he became an activist of the Puerto Rican community and Latino community overall.

Jimmy also organized and became president of the Puerto Rico Action Initiative. To respond to Hurricane Irma, Jimmy has helped to organize a coordinated group called Aid, Support, and Help Coordinating Group, otherwise known as CASA.

The son of Cuban immigrants, Jorge is from West New York, New Jersey, where he graduated from Rutgers University, like myself, with a dual degree in journalism and communication. Now he is glad to be back in central Florida, where he enjoys the change of seasons each year. He enjoys the warm weather because it gives him a chance to leave

Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and privilege to recognize the life of fallen Kissimmee Police Officer Matthew Baxter, who passed away August 18, 2017. Matthew and his supervisor, Sergeant Sam Howard, were fatally wounded while responding to a shots fired call in the northern area of Kissimmee. Both officers sacrificed their lives in the line of duty protecting a woman, whose own statement said, ‘‘without question,’’ the two men were responsible for saving her life. Matthew lived and served honorably, proving that no matter where you come from or where you are going, you can make a difference. Matthew was born in Baltimore, Maryland. Throughout his youth Matthew demonstrated his energetic personality and desire to be a role model in the community through his participation in athletics like basketball, football, and wrestling. His motto was ‘‘pursue the dreams closest to the heart and never giving up,’’ led to his graduation from Jefferson High School in 2009, graduation from Valencia College with a degree in Criminal Justice, and his pursuit of a graduate program at Eastern Florida State College. Matthew joined the police academy to give back and help his community. Through his participation in programs such as Big Brothers and Big Sisters, and through his role as a police officer, Matthew was able to mentor youth. Instilling in them his dedication to pursue a path of helping those around them for the betterment of the community. Matthew’s message of love, encouragement, strength, and community live on in every one of the people he touched in the community and with his family; which includes his wife, Sadia Baxter, and his four daughters Sariah, Isabella, Zarah, and Sofia. For those who put the wellbeing of others before their own, they will never be forgotten.

Ms. Williams has worked for the Federal Government for 37 years, providing exceptional service to the Presidio of Monterey as a Contract Officer with Mission and Installation Contracting Command, Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center, and Installation Management Command. As a Contract Officer, Ms. Williams established a pattern of consistent merit, and her hard work served as an example to others. She excelled in her responsibilities of independently planning, directing and executing many complex contract actions while executing her duties promptly and professionally. It has been Ms. Williams’ duty to ensure compliance and continuity in the office, even extending her retirement date six months later than planned to help meet great contracting demands. Through her rigorous and thorough monitoring of purchasing and coordination efforts, Ms. Williams ensured critical deadlines were met while providing excellent service. Ms. Williams held many key contracts, enabling many projects supporting our service members. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize the duty, tireless efforts, and consummate professionalism of Ms. Evan Malissa Williams. I ask my distinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing Ms. Williams’ outstanding service. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Dione Buonto, CEO of the Grand Strand Boys and Girls Club, for being selected to win the 2017 Maytag Dependable Leadership Award. As one of only 10 recipients of this award nationwide, Ms. Buonto is among the best of the best and is truly deserving of this recognition. In order to receive this award, recipients must possess three key traits: dependability, reliability and leadership. Throughout her time at the Grand Strand Boys and Girls Club, Ms. Buonto has exemplified all of these traits and more. To see why she is so deserving, look no further than the success of the Club and the youth that are a part of it. Under the direction and leadership of Ms. Buonto, the Grand Strand Boys and Girls Club has become an awardwinning program for students, with a dozen Club graduates currently attending college on scholarships made possible by their involvement in the Club. Ms. Buonto makes it her mission to invest in every student. She is a true credit to the youth she coaches and to the entire Grand Strand community. Because of her leadership and being honored with this award, the Grand Strand Boys and Girls Club will now have the opportunity to continue to invest in and change the lives of youth all across the Grand Strand. Congratulations to Dione, and I thank her for all she does. f 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and privilege to recognize the life of fallen Kissimmee Police Sergeant Sam Howard III, who passed away August 19, 2017. Sam and his fellow officer, Matthew Baxter, were fatally wounded on August 18, 2017, while responding to a shotsfired call in the northern area of Kissimmee. Both officers sacrificed their lives in the line of duty protecting a woman, whose own statement said, ‘‘without question,’’ the two men were responsible for saving her life. Sam was born on September 20, 1981, in Bartow, Florida. Raised in Central Florida, he graduated from Osceola High School in 2000. Shortly after graduating, Sam joined the Florida Army National Guard and served in Iraq from December 2003 to March 2005. Fulfilling a goal his wife, Billie Jo Howard, says was always on his mind; to serve and protect. After his military service, Sam’s desire to serve and protect led to his pursuit of joining the Kissimmee Police Department on January 22, 2007. Sam was a Detective Corporal, Street Crimes Corporal, Traffic Homicide Investigator, DUI Officer, Motors Officer, and S.W.A.T. Sniper. On July 7, 2017, his impressive work effort and dedication led to his promotion to the rank of Sergeant. Sam’s sense of duty also carried over to his responsibilities as a father and husband. Sam had always kept his promise to be a role model and good father to his daughter, Unique. Through hard times and good, Sam always put Unique as his priority; as he would always attend her sporting events. Sam’s wife would say ‘‘everyone should be blessed to have a father like Sam.’’ Sam was not only a leader of our community in Kissimmee, but he was also a good person and friend to those who knew him. 
Through Sam’s passion for cars and athletics, his positivity brought joy to those around him. As a leader, Sam only wanted what was best for the community, and to make sure the people knew he was there to help those in need. For those who guard over us are our fellow brothers and sisters, who give their hearts to the communities they serve. 
HON. SAM OLENS TO BE INVESTED AS THE FOURTH PRESIDENT OF KENNESAW STATE UNIVERSITY 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, October 19, the Honorable Sam Olens will be invested as the fourth President of Kennesaw State University in my home state of Georgia. I congratulate my friend Sam, the University, and the Kennesaw State community on this historic day. KSU, as it is known, has been at the forefront of educational opportunities for students across Georgia and has grown to be the third largest institution of higher learning in the state. With an enrollment of nearly 40,000 students, it represents one of the most geographically and culturally diverse institutions in the region and I am proud to have this school in my district, and to recognize this historic moment. Before joining Kennesaw State, Sam served as Georgia’s 53rd Attorney General, Vice President of the National Association of Attorneys General, and Chairman of the Cobb County Board of Commissioners. He received his juris doctorate from Emory University School of Law, and holds a Bachelors and Masters degree from American University in International Politics. As Dr. Olens and the University look to the future, I wish them continued success in their efforts on behalf of KSU students and faculty, the Kennesaw community, and the state of Georgia. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my profound concern about renewed violence in the Western Myanmar State of Rakhine and the resulting refugee and humanitarian crisis. The growing violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine State has already claimed the lives of 1,000 men, women and children who were brutally killed in recent clashes between the Myanmar military and Rohingya civilians. The military has also reportedly targeted some of the alleged survivors who sought justice and protection within Myanmar, leaving little recourse for those being victimized but to flee the country to neighboring Bangladesh. Rohingya Muslims have long been victims of official discrimination, living as a stateless minority community under restrictive citizenship laws and constant threat of abuse and violence. The government of Myanmar must begin taking concrete steps to stop the downward spiral of sectarian violence, which imperils the safety of upwards of a million Rohingya Muslims. More than half a million Rohingya have fled Myanmar since major clashes occurred on August 25, 2017. Using satellite imagery, Human Rights Watch has documented more than 700 buildings in the Rohingya Muslim village of Chein Khar Li have been burned, accounting for more than 99 percent of the village. An additional 450 buildings were recently spotted smoldering in Maungdaw, the administrative capital of Maungdaw Township. This destruction suggests a coordinated effort to drive the Rohingya population out of the country. There are divergent reports regarding who is to blame for the chaos in Western Myanmar. Refugees blame the Myanmar military while the government blames the militant Arkan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). For this reason, it is imperative that the government permit entry of a U.N. Human Rights Commission Fact Finding Mission to impartially document and assess the violence occurring in Rakhine State. Timely and accurate information about the crisis is especially crucial in this conflict because Myanmar has cracked down on the media, using all the draconian tools at its disposal to keep criticism hidden from public view. The government has actually prosecuted scores of individuals under an egregious defamation law that has criminalized social media postings that merely express the plight of the Rohingya people. The international human rights community has criticized Myanmar’s Telecommunications Law for its vagueness, its severity of punishment, and its sweeping chilling effect on freedom of expression. The government of Myanmar should begin adopting the recommendations of the Kofi Annan Foundation Advisory Commission on Rakhine State contained in the August 2017 Final Report, which was released the day before violence in the region erupted. These recommendations include providing dignified living conditions in camps for internally displaced persons and granting national and international humanitarian groups full access to the communities of Rakhine State. The continuing censorship of the media suggests that the government does not want the world to witness the crimes that are being perpetrated in the Rakhine State. It is my hope that Myanmar will begin taking substantial and sustained steps to prevent any further violence in Rakhine State. I urge my colleagues to join me in calling on Myanmar to take meaningful action to desegregate the Rohingya Muslim population, repeal its repressive criminal defamation law, and permit human rights observers access to monitor the situation. 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to recognize Medical Advocacy and Outreach (MAO) for 30 years of dedicated service to the rural and underserved communities of Alabama. MAO, formerly known as Medical AIDS Outreach and Montgomery AIDS Outreach, is a private, nonprofit, Rural Health and Wellness Organization and Community Based AIDS Service Organization in Montgomery, Alabama. It was founded in 1987 by a group of volunteers who were both directly and indirectly affected by HIV/ AIDS. In 1994, after being awarded Ryan White Care Act Part C funds, MAO transitioned from a volunteer education and service organization to a fulltime, health care facility. Because of the hard work of many working together on the local, state and federal level over the years, MAO now operates the largest HIV specific health care facility by geographic area within the state of Alabama, the Copeland Care Clinic. I am inspired by the small group of volunteers, many who are still involved and supportive today, who have been responsible for the growth of this organization over the past 30 years. Today, MAO provides education services to members of the community and medical and social services to those living with and affected by HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, and Diabetes. MAO and the Copeland Clinic currently provide services to over 1600 patients who live in Montgomery and 28 surrounding counties in Southeast Alabama. In addition, MAO provides an array of comprehensive services and care for individuals living with HIV/AIDS, including: medication assistance, pharmacist consultations, housing services, an onsite food pantry, mental health counseling/case management, patient education, prevention education, free HIV and Hepatitis C testing, PrEP and interpretation services for Spanishspeaking individuals and the hearing impaired. Through their Telehealth Resource Center, they assist other providers with the integration of telemedicine technology into patientcentered environments in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, New York, South Carolina, and Tennessee. In addition to providing direct health care services, MAO educates the public about HIV/ AIDS and related illnesses and how to prevent transmission of infection. To this end, the organization has made significant progress in educating the public on the reality that a person living with HIV who has an undetectable viral load cannot transmit the virus to their partners. This is why the staff at MAO also works so hard to ensure that individuals living with HIV receive regular treatment. As a matter of fact, MAO has a new initiative called ‘‘Zero by 2020.’’ The targeted goal is to have no new HIV diagnoses in Lowndes County, Alabama in the year 2020. I truly believe this can be done if we support organizations like MAO that provide free testing and educate citizens on the importance of getting regular health screenings. MAO has two full service health and wellness clinics in Montgomery and Dothan where specialty care and related primary and dental care is provided to individuals living with HIV, Hepatitis C, and Diabetes. In addition to these full service facilities, MAO operates 10 rural telemedicine sites throughout Alabama in the following locations: Marengo County; Lowndes County; Dallas County; Perry County; Barbour County; Escambia County; Conecuh County; Covington County, Henry County; and Pike County. As the Member of Congress that represents the Black Belt, I am honored to be able to work with 
MAO and other partners in their work to provide health care services to rural populations through telemedicine. The services that MAO provides have grown to include a licensed professional counselor, mental health counselling and assessments, including for substance abuse and addiction, social services, and maternal and infant services. MAO collaborates with three area substance abuse treatment centers to provide prevention education to recovering addicts. MAO also houses the Alabama AIDS Education and Training Center (AETC), a continuing education program serving healthcare providers and professionals statewide. The board, staff, and community partners with MAO work every day to fulfill their vision, which is to eradicate HIV/AIDS and other diseases that impact our most vulnerable neighbors. The progress this organization has made in 30 years demonstrates what can be accomplished when dedicated and committed individuals work together for substantive change. I am proud to be the Member of Congress that represents MAO. The reality is that all individuals living with HIV/AIDS and related illnesses deserve to live a healthy life filled with dignity and respect. Thanks to MAO, countless lives have been touched and saved by their work. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Keith Swerdfeger of Pueblo, Colorado, who has been honored with the Lifetime Business Achievement Award from the Colorado State University–Pueblo. Keith Swerdfeger was born and raised in Pueblo, Colorado, and has had a lifelong passion to start a business and make a contribution to his hometown. In 1968, Keith realized his dream of becoming a business owner, opening Swerdfeger Construction, Inc. with his wife Sharon. This was the beginning of a very successful business venture. Today, Swerdfeger Construction, Inc. is a vital part of Pueblo’s economy as well as in Southern Colorado and six other states, employing 500 people. Keith readily gives all of the credit to his employees for his company’s success, while continuing to strive to create more jobs and opportunities. Keith is passionate about investing in the Pueblo community and firmly believes that part of his company’s success has come as the result of the work he, his family and employees have done to give back. Keith has been very active with the Pueblo Economic Development Corporation, Pueblo County United Way, the Colorado Contractors, the Distribution Contractor Association, the Greater Pueblo Chamber of Commerce and other civic and industry associations. Keith represented Colorado House of Representatives District 47 from 2011 to 2013 where he served on the Economic and Business Development Committee, the Finance Committee and the Local Government Committee. He was a strong advocate for his District and the community of Pueblo—and worked diligently to bring jobs and economic opportunities to the people of southern Colorado. Mr. Speaker, Keith Swerdfeger has been a longtime business leader and tireless civic volunteer for his hometown of Pueblo, Colorado. I’m fortunate to consider him a dear friend. When we tell younger generations of Puebloans that the keys to a successful life are dedication and a strong work ethic, we can point to Keith as an example. Pueblo is grateful to have Keith Swerdfeger as one of its sons. f 
HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Soto amendment, Soto number 11 to Division H, the Department of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, increased funding to the Housing for the Elderly Program by $2,500,000. It did so by shifting $2,500,000 from the Policy Development and Research, Research and Technology account within HUD.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE ALABAMA OUTSTANDING YOUNG FARM FAMILY FOR 2017 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I ask for the House’s attention to recognize the Alabama Outstanding Young Farm Family for 2017, the Lovvorn Family. The Lovvorn’s, Eric, Carrly, Chole (2) and Landon (3 months), live in near Ranburne, Alabama, and have a fourhouse poultry farm and cattle. They also grow hay and are co owners of LHT Trucking, a poultry house cleanout business. Eric grew up around poultry farming and by the age of 12 had decided chicken houses wouldn’t be in his future. That changed when he bought his first poultry farm in Cleburne County at the age of 20. Eric and Carrly met in 2008 at a University of Georgia football game and were married in 2011. Carrly works at Georgia Power Company. The Lovvorns love farming and want their children to know how important farming is. Eric serves as the Cleburne County Young Farmers chairman and participated in the Agricultural Leaders for Alabama program. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the Alabama Outstanding Young Farm Family for 2017: Eric, Carrly, Chole and Landon Lovvorn. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. JAMES B. RENACCI 
Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 558, and YEA on Roll Call No. 559. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF TRINITY UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST, TAMAQUA 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Trinity United Church of Christ, Tamaqua which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. For a century and a half, Trinity has served as a place of worship and community for the residents of Tamaqua, from the early German settlers of the region to modern congregants from diverse backgrounds. In 1835, Trinity’s parent church, St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran and Reformed Church, was founded by the German population of Tamaqua. In 1867, twelve men and their families left the congregation of St. John’s to form Trinity Church under the guidance of Reverend Levi K. Derr. One of the original twelve, Daniel Shepp donated land to build the church at the comer of Lafayette and Washington Streets. In September 1868, Reverend I.E. Graeff became the first fulltime pastor, serving until March 1873. In 1961, the present church was dedicated and, over the following decades, improvements were made to the building and grounds. The church’s distinctive exterior is marked by the Trinity chime, a landmark in Tamaqua. Additionally, Trinity is unique in that it is one of the very few churches that have its own hymn. In 1942, Rev. Dr. Henry A. W. Shaeffer wrote the words, and Mrs. Gertrude Wagner wrote the music to the signature piece. Today, Trinity, under the leadership of Pastor Darry Kensinger, celebrates a diverse, vibrant congregation dedicated to serving Tamaqua and the surrounding community in the tradition of the United Church of Christ, known for being open minded, inclusive, and welcoming. 
Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent in the House chamber for votes Tuesday, October 10, 2017. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘Yea’’ on roll call votes 558 and 559. 
TAX COUNSELING FOR THE ELDERLY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Soto amendment, Soto number 27 to Division D, the Department of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, increased funding to the Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program by $1,000,000. It did so by making an additional carveout of money from the overall Taxpayer Services Account. I support increased funding for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program and thank Chairman GRAVES and my colleagues for their support of my amendment. 
CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a letter from the National Education Association. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION , Washington, DC, October 4, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the more than three million members of the National Education Association (NEA), and the 50 million students they serve, we urge you to Vote No on the FY 2018 budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 71) being brought to the House floor this week, and offer our views on the alternative budgets that have been proposed. The budget should reflect the priorities of our nation and should especially meet the needs of children and those most in need. Actions on this issue may be included in the NEA Legislative Report Card for the 115th Congress. In addition to urging a NO vote on H. Con. Res. 71, we urge you to: Vote YES on the Democratic substitute budget. This budget stresses the need to invest in our economic future. It lifts the budget caps, broadens access to education, defends and strengthens the Affordable Care Act, invests in infrastructure, raises the minimum wage, and supports tax reform that supports American families and workers. Vote YES on the budget presented by the Congressional Progressive Caucus offered by Reps. Pocan (D–WI) and Grijalva (D–AZ). This budget provides a practical, progressive vision for our country by investing in 21st century infrastructure and jobs, tackling inequality, making corporations pay their fair share, and strengthening essential public programs. Vote YES on the budget presented by the Congressional Black Caucus offered by Rep. Scott (D–VA). This budget would establish funding levels to allow for investments in key programs like education, infrastructure and job training, makes the tax code more progressive and fair, repeals the Budget Control Act and ends the threat of sequestration, and create jobs while also reducing the deficit. Vote NO on the budget presented by the Republican Study Committee authored by Reps. Walker (R–NC) and McClintock (R– CA). This budget goes beyond the Budget Committee proposal in terms of balancing the budget on the backs of those least able to afford it by cutting spending $5.7 trillion over the next 10 years. The budget also would repeal the Affordable Care Act, increase the Medicare eligibility age, and block grant Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. We strongly oppose H. Con. Res. 71 because it takes us in the wrong direction as a nation by making dramatic cuts to essential programs and services in order to finance tax cuts for the wealthy. Specifically, we oppose: Doubling down on deep cuts to education and other domestic programs. This proposal would cut NonDefenseDiscretionary programs (i.e. education, health care, job training, etc.), which are already at historically low levels (as a percentage of GDP), by lowering the already inadequate spending caps by $5 billion in 2018 and cutting spending for NDD programs by $1.3 trillion over the next decade. This would force even deeper cuts to crucial investments like education depriving students of the opportunity they all deserve for a quality education. Making dramatic cuts for essential programs to finance a massive tax cut for the wealthy and add $2.4 trillion to our country’s debt. According to the Tax Policy Center, the top one percent of households would get 80 percent of the framework’s next tax cuts, or more than $200,000 annually on average. Slashing Medicaid and other health programs, which provides healthcare for more than onethird of our nation’s children. Overall funding for Medicaid and other programs would be cut by $1.5 trillion over the decade, while Medicare would be cut by $487 billion over the decade. Voucherizing Medicare and shifting costs to seniors. Under the proposed plan, seniors would receive ‘‘premium support’’—fixed payments to help buy coverage, which would likely fail to keep pace with rising healthcare costs. The plan also could also lead to the gradual demise of traditional Medicare by making the pool of beneficiaries smaller, older, and sicker—and increasingly costly to cover. Student aid cuts, which appear to include deep cuts to the Pell Grant program and student loans. We should be working to make college more affordable for more students. For too long Congress has tied its own hands with senseless and untenable budget caps, resulting in wholly inadequate funding levels for critical programs like education. This budget would make that problem much worse and sets the stage to enact massive tax cuts for the wealthy. We urge you to Vote NO on the FY18 budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 71). Sincerely, MARCEGAN, Director, Government Relations, National Education Association. f 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Donald G. Freeman, a constituent of California’s Twentieth Congressional district on the occasion of his retirement. Don began his tenure as City Attorney for the City of CarmelbytheSea in 1983. Since then, he has worked with seven mayors and is the longest serving city attorney in the city’s history. During his tenure, he has provided a full range of legal services as the chief legal advisor to the city council, city administrator, the city’s departments, boards and commissions. He has consistently provided sound legal advice to the council during the course of innumerable meetings and has served as counsel for several special districts, including the Carmel Area Wastewater and the Seaside Redevelopment Agency. He is also an active member of the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments, as well as the Mayor’s Water Authority. He has also gone out of his way to provide the council, city staff, board and commission members with mentoring and training in areas of ethics, conflicts of interest, and the Brown Act. In the performance of his duties, Don regularly evaluated projects that involved complex legal issues, recommended options to minimize legal risk, and ensured due process in city decisions. As he managed and guided the city through various types of litigation, he demonstrated a mastery of negotiating lease agreements, and drafting ordinances and resolutions that helped protect and preserve the character and integrity of CarmelbytheSea. In addition to the vital role he played in service to the City, Don maintained a strong belief in public service, helping others, fundamental fairness, and the importance of law and education. Over time, he developed a keen appreciation for the history of Carmel and for its unique village character, eventually becoming one of its staunchest defenders. His understanding of CarmelbytheSea, and his many contributions have proven to be indispensable to the city’s officials and residents. Don has built strong ties that have benefitted Carmel. His counsel, guidance, and support to the City Council, city employees, and the community have made him a valued colleague. His historical and institutional knowledge will be missed by those who will carry on the work of the City or Carmel. In honor and recognition of his service, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to Donald G. Freeman for his more than 33 years of counsel, advice, and dedication to the city of CarmelbytheSea. I ask that my colleagues join me in wishing Mr. Freeman the very best in his future endeavors, and a very happy retirement. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBIN MADSEN—LABOR LEADER AND FRIEND 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a dear friend, a committed public servant, and a fierce labor leader from St. Paul, Minnesota—Ms. Robin Madsen. Robin passed away last week at the age of 69 after a battle with cancer. Her death is a personal loss for me since I have known her for more than thirty years. Robin was a wonderful woman, a tireless believer in organized labor, 
a champion for children, and one of the kindest souls you could ever meet. For thirtysix years Robin drove the St. Paul Public Library bookmobile. She was the ‘‘bookmobile lady’’ to thousands of children who were able to explore their interests, new ideas, and the world because Robin’s bookmobile came to their neighborhood. Robin also became the president of AFSCME 1842 where she served as a committed advocate for workers, public employees, and political candidates who were willing to invest in community services to meet the needs of families and children. From my first campaign for Congress in 2000 I was honored to have Robin as a friend and supporter. She helped organize a Women of Labor effort and was never shy about speaking her mind or helping behind the scenes. Robin was all about getting results without worrying about getting credit. Robin Madsen was a true friend and a strong woman who I admired and respected greatly. My prayers and condolences are with Robin’s children, grandchildren and countless friends. Robin will be missed. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, on October 10, I was attending the funeral of a friend. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 558 and YEA on Roll Call No. 559. 
HUANGLONGBING MULTIAGENCY COORDINATION EFFORTS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Soto amendment, Soto number 24 to Division B, the Department of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, moved $1,000,000 from the Office of the Economist account to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s Specialty Crop Pest Program, specifically the Huanglongbing MultiAgency Coordination Efforts. I support increased funding for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s Specialty Crop Pest Program’s Huanglongbing MultiAgency Coordination Efforts and thank Chairman ADERHOLT and my colleagues for their support of my amendment. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I, along with my colleagues, Representatives ROBERT  J. WITTMAN , H. M ORGAN GRIFFITH , DAVEBRAT, THOMAS A. G ARRETT , Jr., and S COTT TAYLOR , rise today to honor the life and service of Lacey E. Putney, a dear friend and the longestserving state legislator in Virginia’s history. Born on June 27, 1928, Lacey passed away on August 26, 2017, at the age of 89. He was born and raised in Big Island, Virginia, and remained a wellrespected member of the community his entire life. After earning his undergraduate degree in 1950 from Washington and Lee University, Lacey enlisted in the United States Air Force where he served for four years. He later graduated from the Washington and Lee University School of Law and went on to practice law for more than 55 years in Bedford. Lacey was first elected to represent the 19th District in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1961. During his time in office, he held many important leadership positions, including Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Chairman of the Privileges and Elections Committee, and as acting Speaker of the House in 2003. Lacey was a true force in the state legislature, and he knew how to get things done. Anyone who worked with him witnessed that firsthand, and his hard work can be seen throughout western Virginia. He was instrumental in establishing the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute in Roanoke and the Virginia Horse Center in Lexington, creating the National DDay Memorial in Bedford, and restoring Thomas Jefferson’s Poplar Forest. He led many successful legislative initiatives during his tenure, including the creation of the Virginia Tuition Assistance Grant program, the Virginia Retirement System, and the Virginia community college system. In 2013, Lacey retired from public service after 52 years. It was only fitting that upon his passing Lacey lie in state in the rotunda of the State Capitol. Lacey’s legacy is one of service, kindness, and action. He was trusted by the people he represented and respected by his colleagues. He exemplified the role of a citizen legislator and set an example for all of us through his passion for serving his fellow Virginians. We are honored to have known Lacey Putney over the years, and the Commonwealth of Virginia is better because of individuals like him. With his passing, Virginia lost one of its greatest treasures. We offer our condolences to his beloved wife, Carmela, as well as the entire Putney family. Our prayers are with them as they mourn this loss and celebrate his life. May God give them comfort and peace. While he may be gone from this earth, there is no doubt that his legacy will live on. 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Jerry Kleczka. He was a true public servant and legislator. He passed away on October 8, 2017. He was 73 years old. Jerry Kleczka grew up on the south side of Milwaukee. He graduated from Don Bosco High School, attended the University of WisconsinMilwaukee for two years, worked as an accountant and served in the Wisconsin National Guard. Jerry Kleczka was elected to the Wisconsin State Legislature at age 24 where he served in both the Assembly and Senate. In 1984, he won a special election to replace Clement Zablocki in Congress and served for over two decades until his retirement in 2005. I succeeded Jerry Kleczka in the 4th Congressional District and appreciate his kindness in assisting me through the transition to Washington. He gave me a gift of African cloth from one of his trips that I cherish to this day. While in Congress, Jerry Kleczka served on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee; he formed a warm and lasting friendship with Representative JOHN LEWIS during that tenure. He twice voted against going to war—the Gulf War in 1991 and the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Some of his signature legislation included support for seniors and preventing ‘‘drivethrough’’ baby deliveries when insurance companies forced some women to leave hospitals too soon after giving birth. Jerry Kleczka was a serious, hardworking legislator with a strong work ethic. He took pride in being the guy from the south side of Milwaukee. When my alma mater, Marquette University began an internship program in Washington, D.C., in 1984 for students interested in careers in government and public service, Kleczka was a strong supporter. Jerry Kleczka donated his campaign funds of $300,000 to endow what became in 2005 the Kleczka Internship Program. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of law degree in 2005 by Marquette University. Many of the interns serving in my office were members of this program; this is Jerry Kleczka’s lasting legacy to the entire community. Upon his retirement, Jerry moved to Middleton. Middleton was Bonnie’s, his wife of 39 years, hometown. He lived quietly and was busy with hobbies that included gardening, woodworking and remodeling projects. Mr. Speaker, Jerry Kleczka was a valued member of Milwaukee, the 4th Congressional District, and the entire State of Wisconsin. I applaud and value his stewardship. I urge you and my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in a salute to the late Jerry Kleczka. 
CONGRATULATING DR. R.W. BOBBY MARTIN ON A LIFETIME OF CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE 
Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Bobby Martin on his retirement from the Dallas Baptist Association. For the past 48 years, Dr. Martin has devoted his time and efforts to providing Christian leadership and education to churches. Dr. Martin has demonstrated a lifetime of passion for Christian education, including his own.

Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a community trailblazer, father, husband, and man of God, the Reverend Dr. A.V. Fisher. The Reverend Dr. A.V. Fisher was born the sixth of seven children to Essie J. and Corine Caraway Fisher in 1933 in Marshall County, Texas. After graduating from Pemberton High School, Reverend Fisher forged his own path to become the first male student to graduate Cosmetology at Valarie Hurd Beauty College. In 1958, Reverend Fisher brought his expertise and work ethic to Fort Worth where he opened his first beauty salon. Reverend Fisher immediately transformed the salon into a community icon that caught the attention of Ebony and Beauty Trade Magazines, ranking him as one of the Top 100 Beauty Operators in the United States. The Texas Legislature joined their high praise by honoring Reverend Fisher for 50 years as a Hair Stylist and Beauty Owner. Following his successful barbershop career, Reverend Fisher decided to embark on a new chapter of this life by transitioning into ministry. He entered the Gospel Ministry in 1963 under the spiritual guidance of Reverend James Warren and Dr. M.R. Lester, and later became pastor of the Salem Missionary Baptist Church. As a Reverend, Dr. Fisher has welcomed hundreds to his church; baptized many, ordained over 300 deacons, and installed over 200 preachers as pastors all over the United States. Additionally, Reverend Fisher’s service did not waiver. He founded the Black Pastor’s Association, coordinated the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Service and Prayer Breakfast for 30 years, and helped found the East Fort Worth Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance. Reverend Fisher graduated from the New World Bible Institute, and has received numerous awards including an honorary doctorate. He has preached all across the United States and the Bahamas. Reverend Dr. A.V. Fisher passed away on Tuesday, October 3, 2017 and is survived by his wife, Verdell Knighten, and their three beautiful daughters, Avis Michelle, Ava LaNell, and Adrain Van. I honor and celebrate the life of a dedicated community servant, Reverend Dr. A.V. Fisher.

Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague, The Honorable JOSEPH  CROWLEY , to recognize the 80th anniversary of Queens College, an institution of higher education in Queens that provides an exemplary education to nearly 20,000 students annually. Queens College opened its doors on October 11, 1937, and ushered in the first class of students to the first public college in Queens. On the first day of classes, Queens College President Paul Klapper remarked, ‘‘We are the pioneers of a new institution. We have no history to look back to, but we can look forward to progress.’’ Mr. Speaker, I believe that President Klapper would be proud to see the remarkable progress that Queens College has made. The Princeton Review has continuously commended the college for offering a worldclass education by an illustrious faculty for an affordable price. It is no wonder that it places in the top 1 percent of colleges that successfully move its students from the bottomfifth income distribution percentile to the topfifth income distribution percentile. In its eighty years, 160,000 students have become alumni. Some have earned Pulitzer Prizes, Emmy Awards, becoming CEOs, or achieved scientific breakthroughs. As an alumnus himself, I know that Congressman CROWLEY is proud to join me in commending Queens College for its steadfast commitment in ensuring that students reach their potential. Queens College has not only cultivated a reputation for investing in student success, but also for being one of the most diverse colleges in the country. Students who are currently enrolled are from 170 countries and speak over 110 languages. Queens College offers 69 undergraduate programs in the arts and sciences. In its eighty years of operations, the college has become a cultural hub for students to pursue and achieve academic success in Queens. I am proud to stand with Congressman CROWLEY to commemorate Queens College’s 80th anniversary. I look forward to seeing what the future will bring for this trailblazing beacon of higher education. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF THELMA G. GOLDSTEIN 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Thelma G. Goldstein, a resident of Falmouth, Massachusetts, who would have turned 100 years young on October 12th. Thelma was born in Manhattan. Her family persevered through the Great Depression supported by her father’s ice cream factory. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s government interventions during that period served as an inspiration that led her to discovering a passion for public service. Her other great passion was her family and no matter how busy she got, she always made time for family and she raised four children with her husband, a career military doctor. Thelma was a devoted Democrat since she cast her first ballot in 1940. Her belief in community engagement followed her through life and led her to becoming the cochairman of the Falmouth Democratic Town Committee. A local legend in Falmouth, Thelma is remembered for her tireless efforts to improve the Democratic Party and as a strong advocate for women in politics. In her nineties, she was organizing trips to New Hampshire to campaign for Hillary Clinton and led local efforts to make phone calls, knock on doors, and hold signs. Unfortunately Thelma passed away on June 9, 2016. She had attended a Democratic Convention just one week earlier. Her commitment to public service continues with the Thelma Goldstein Award for Civic Involvement and with the legacy she left behind in our community. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the life of Thelma G. Goldstein on this occasion of her 100th birthday. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing her many years of dedication to the community.

IN HONOR OF THE CAPITOLA BEGONIA FESTIVAL HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an important milestone in my district. The Capitola Begonia Festival has recently completed its 65th and final year. This event has provided family friendly fun in the beautiful village of Capitola for thousands of people in our neighborhood and beyond. It has brought hundreds of families together and has created many memories that will always be remembered. The Capitola Begonia Festival has been a cherished event in our community since it began in 1952. The begonias have been donated by several growers in our community, including the Antonelli, Vetterle, and Reinelt families. The Golden State Bulb Growers provided additional support that helped keep the tradition alive for 65 years. The begonias provided by all of these growers have been a part of one of the most prized events of the weekend, the Nautical Parade of begonia adorned floats. Each year, volunteers head down to the city of Marina in the early morning to collect the blooming begonias to adorn the floats. While begonias once grew abundantly in Capitola by the 1970’s, they were eventually only to be found in Marina. The Begonia Festival has allowed us to encourage imagination in our community. We have seen a giraffe created out of begonias for the 2007 ‘‘Jungle Safari’’ theme and witnessed the sunshine yellow form of SpongeBob SquarePants come alive for the 2008 ‘‘It Came From the Sea’’ theme. Whether it is creative ideas or creative structures, the Begonia Festival has been an incredible outlet for art, creativity, and imagination here in our community. Along with the Nautical Parade, there have been many other activities created to help celebrate this special weekend. Among these, some favorites stand out, including the Horseshoe Contest, Fishing Derby, and the Sand Sculpture Contest, where art is created from one of the finest mediums found on the Central Coast of California. All of these events are open to the community and beyond, making Capitola a warm and welcoming environment. These cherished events will be remembered fondly for creating a family friendly and historical tradition for Labor Day weekend in our community. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize this treasured community tradition that has brought together countless participants, volunteers, and sponsors. I thank all of those who have given their time and resources to make the Capitola Begonia Festival a gem of our community; one that will be truly missed. 
IN HONOR OF THE 80TH BIRTHDAY OF JUANITA VARNADO PIERCE 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I ask for the House’s attention to recognize the 80th birthday of Juanita Varnado Pierce. Juanita was born to the late Howard and Maggie Lee Varnado and grew up in McComb, Mississippi. She graduated from Tuskegee Institute, now Tuskegee University, in 1974 with a B.S. in Early Childhood Education and from Auburn University with a Master’s in Early Childhood Education in August of 1975. Juanita was married to the late Booker T. Pierce, Sr. and was blessed with three children: Booker T. Pierce, Jr. (Nashville, Tennessee), Vincent B. Pierce (St. Louis, Missouri) and Lisa P. Grant (Alexandria, Virginia). They have two grandsons, Dominque Pierce (Pompano Beach, Florida) and Nicholas B. Grant, who is a third year Mechanical Engineering Student at Georgia Tech. Juanita started teaching 2nd grade at Dean Road Elementary School in Auburn in August of 1975 and continued teaching 2nd grade for 17 years. After completing her Administration Certification from the University of Alabama, she was hired as the Assistant Principal at Dean Road Elementary in Fall of 1992 and became Principal in Fall of 1996. She retired as Principal of Dean Road Elementary School in the Fall of 1998. After joining Washington Chapel A.M.E. Church in 1960, she started teaching the pre school Sunday School class and remained the teacher for nearly 50 years. She still serves in the Cathedral Choir, as a member of the Stewardess Board and is active in Sunday School. In Summer of 2005, Juanita founded the S.M.A.R.T. (Science, Math, Art, Reading and Technology) Camp. Funded by grants and donations, this free twoweek camp was started at Washington Chapel A.M.E. Church with approximately 40 students. Today, it is held at George Washington Carver Elementary School due to size and nearly 100 applications. A surprise Ladies’ Luncheon will be held with women who have blessed her life over the years on October 21st at O’Charley’s in Opelika, Alabama. Mr. Speaker, please join me in wishing Juanita Varnado Pierce a very happy 80th birthday. f 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Patti Canchola, a wellrespected veterinarian at Pueblo Animal Services. Patti was voted the 2017 American Humane Hero Veterinarian, which is a national honor bestowed upon an individual who improves the lives of animals and their owners in unheralded ways. Patti performs 3,500 to 4,500 spay and neuter procedures a year, as well as 200 other surgeries. She voluntarily takes veterinary forensics courses that train her on identifying abused, neglected, and mistreated animals that are a part of criminal investigations. When off the clock, Patti operates Amazin’ Amos Pet Food Pantry, a nonprofit food bank, as well as St. Martin’s Well Pet Clinic, an independent lowcost health center. Both of these organizations help pet owners with low socioeconomic status provide their animals with the care and food they need. 
As a child in Pueblo, Patti would bring home wounded cats, dogs, squirrels, and birds in need of assistance. Her love of animals has continued throughout her entire life. We are truly fortunate to have such an upstanding and dedicated member of our community and on behalf of the Third District I would like to thank Patti for her generous service to the community.
