Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, the liberation of Mosul from the Islamic State the other week was a major vic-tory for the Iraqi people and for the United States, which supported the op-eration. But to achieve victory in our broader mission of destroying radical Islamic terrorism and keeping the American people safe, we must confront some tough questions about the road ahead. As chairman of the Task Force on Denying Terrorists Entry into the United States, I am concerned about the degree to which jihadists and for-eign fighters threaten our homeland and our ability to meet these threats. b1030 We know that Iraqi fighters are con-cealing their identities and fleeing with groups of refugees, many to Eu-rope. These returning fighters have learned to make dangerous weapons, have gotten battlefield experience, and are successfully training young people susceptible to radicalization. We know our visa waiver program, which allows many European citizens to travel to the U.S. without a visa, provides a win-dow of opportunity for these deter-mined terrorists to exploit. Confronting these threats lies in our ability to quickly and effectively vet and screen travelers, share sufficient intelligence with our allies, and act on credible threats when identified. And the threats are real. Between 100 and 250 ideologically driven foreigners are thought to have been smuggled into Europe between 2014 and 2016. These foreign fighters pose a greater threat to the West than ever before; and for the sake of our na-tional security, it is a threat we cannot overlook, and it is a threat we must work together to confront. Nothing can be put ahead of the safety and security of the homeland. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
THE ROLE OF CONGRESS IN PUSHING BACK  
AGAINST RUSSIA  
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not as a Republican or a Democrat, but as an American. If we can really find a way to cut through the media circus surrounding the de-bate about Russia in the past few weeks, I think it would reinforce for all of us that whatever our political dif-ferences, our country must always come first. Those who would destroy our way of life do not wear the jersey of one polit-ical party or another. The only laundry

they wear is the flag of their nation, whose interests they will advance re-gardless of domestic American politics. And make no mistake, Mr. Speaker: Russia, under Vladimir Putin, is not our friend. He is on no one’s team but his own. There are concrete steps that we in Congress can take to push back against Russian aggression both here at home and overseas. To start with, we must pass sanctions on Russia and Iran. The Senate passed a sanctions bill 98–2 just 1 month ago. We need to do the same. No more excuses. We need to vote im-mediately. Most of all, Congress must reclaim its long-neglected role in foreign pol-icy. Russia is not and will never be a partner in Syria. It has supported and enabled the Assad regime’s genocidal war while focusing much of its military campaign against U.S.-supported rebels. At the same time, the growth of Ira-nian power has deepened the sectarian atmosphere off which ISIS thrives. ISIS and Iran are two sides of the same coin of religious fundamentalism. To advance our long-term interests in Syria and in the Middle East, we must cease outsourcing our foreign pol-icy to our adversaries, and we can no longer cede a sphere of influence to the Russians and the Iranians. We here in Congress have a constitu-tionally mandated role to play. True, we have been derelict in this duty for decades, but we now have an oppor-tunity to reclaim our authority. As part of a congressionally led cam-paign to push back against our adver-saries, we should revisit the underlying authorities that are allowing us to con-duct lethal activities around the world. We need to pass a new Authorization for Use of Military Force to put our ef-forts against ISIS, against al-Qaida, against all of their affiliates and any-one else who would seek to challenge our interests on the strongest legal footing possible. We can’t just sit on the sidelines. The part of passive spec-tator is unworthy of this great body. We must lead when it comes to both enhancing our defenses against attacks and pushing back against Russian or Iranian aggression abroad. To do other-wise would be to abdicate our responsi-bility to our constituents, to our Na-tion, and to the oath we all took to protect this country.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN JACKSONVILLE SOLDIER, MA-RINE SERGEANT JOSEPH MUR-RAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. R
UTHERFORD ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Marine Ser-geant Joseph Murray, who paid the ul-timate sacrifice on July 12, 2017, when a KC–130 military transport plane crashed in the Mississippi Delta. Sergeant Murray had lived in Jack-sonville, Florida, since he was 10 years old and was a military dependent whose father was in the Navy for over 20 years. He was a Sandalwood High School graduate in the class of 2009, and joined the Marines that same year. He was stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Sergeant Murray was promoted three times in the first 3 years he was in the Marine Corps, and he was very proud of his two deployments to Afghanistan. He told his father he wanted to be a grunt instead of an intelligence officer because ‘‘that is the hardest thing to do.’’ He died as a member of a special operations team, where his closest friends were the fellow marines who served next to him. Sergeant Murray was a proud hus-band and father, with four children: a 5-year-old son, a 3-year-old daughter, and 1-year-old twin boys. He met his wife, Gayle, the same year he joined the military, and he was a family man who loved to serve oth-ers. Gayle said that he would do any-thing for his family and loved to play his guitar for them. She said: ‘‘What he wanted most in the world, besides his family’s happiness, was to destroy evil on Earth.’’ His father, Terry, stated the only thing stronger than his commitment to his family was his commitment to his church. In fact, he was known to hum praise and worship songs when he was on patrol, and his fellow servicemem-bers looked to him as a faith leader. A fellow marine mentioned: ‘‘When Jo-seph stopped that humming and sing-ing praises, they took the safeties off their weapons because they thought something was up. All was well when Joseph was with them.’’ His father said: ‘‘The city of Jackson-ville should be very proud to have had his son come from here.’’ I can attest today for the citizens of northeast Florida that we are very proud, very proud and honored to have had Sergeant Murray defending our freedoms. Sergeant Murray’s dedica-tion to his faith, family, and nation will always be remembered. May God bless and keep you and your family. Semper fi, Sergeant Murray. f 
A TOO-MUCH-IS-NOT-ENOUGH MENTALITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. A
LGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to address the problem with TrumpCare. The problem with TrumpCare is a too-much-is-not-enough mentality: a too-much-is-not-enough mentality that would cause some to be willing to sac-rifice the needy to satiate the insatia-ble desires of the greedy; a too-much- is-not-enough mentality that would allow some to rob the needy of healthcare to reward the rich with wealthcare—a too-much-is-not-enough mentality. This too-much-is-not-enough men-tality exists at a time, Mr. Speaker, when the very wealthy are doing very well in this country: The big banks are banking big bucks. The healthcare industry is quite healthy. In fact, last year the indus-try’s net income was up $13.1 billion. That is 46 percent. CEOs are doing quite well. The top 10 percent CEOs are raking in millions, annually. Let’s look at the number one person on the top 10. This person had an income of $98 million, up 499 per-cent. Mr. Speaker, I don’t begrudge people from making money. I don’t begrudge people from making a lot of money. I do think that they should all pay a fair share of taxes on that money, however. Some of them pay carried interest, which is not the ordinary income tax that other people are paying. Mr. Speaker, the too-much-is-not- enough mentality not only impacts the way people view healthcare, but it also impacts people who are making min-imum wage. Juxtapose the person who made $98 million last year with the person who is making $7.25 an hour. By the way, all minimum wage work-ers are making $7.25 an hour except those who are in the service industry, and they make even less. $7.25 an hour, the minimum wage has not been raised in a decade, more than 10 years. CEOs get raises of millions, annually. Mr. Speaker, the too-much-is-not- enough mentality is keeping wages down, causing those at the top to make more and creating a chasm between the top and the bottom, and the middle as well; and in so doing, we have created a class ceiling—a class ceiling. Those who are in the working class are not making enough to make ends meet. At $7.25 an hour, you cannot af-ford to take care of a family. At $7.25 an hour, you can barely manage to take care of your needs, and you can-not afford healthcare. Those who would take a trillion dol-lars out of healthcare, those who would reward the rich with billions of dollars as a result, those who would do it so that they can go on to a tax plan where they will cut even more, those who would do this, Mr. Speaker, have a too- much-is-not-enough mentality. It seems that they believe that the poor can do more with less, and that the rich need more to do more. I refuse to support TrumpCare. I will not support anything developed along the lines of too much is not enough.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5986 July 19, 2017 
Wing of the New York Air National Guard. Commanded by Colonel Michael Bank, the 106th Rescue Wing is based out of Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach, located in my home district, and has a long and dis-tinguished history of service. In October 1991, during the storm that was depicted in the major motion picture ‘‘The Perfect Storm,’’ an HH–60 and tanker from the 106th Rescue Wing flew to an endangered sailboat about 250 miles south of its base. After survival gear was dropped onto the vessel, they began their return to base. However, braving incredibly se-vere weather conditions, the HH–60 was forced to ditch 60 miles south of base in the Atlantic Ocean. All but one mem-ber of the crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard cutter Tamaroa. In addition, in 1998, the 106th Rescue Wing carried out the longest overwater rescue mission in an HH–60. Members of their wing were also on scene at Ground Zero during the 9/11 terror at-tacks. Then, most recently, this past April, the heroic members of this squadron saved several lives when an explosion occurred on a Slovenian cargo ship. These brave airmen took immediate action when called upon to offer des-perately needed medical assistance. On April 24, the cargo ship Tamar was rocked by an explosion in the for-ward bulkhead, which resulted in the immediate death of one individual and severe burns for three other crew mem-bers, one who, sadly, perished prior to the team’s arrival. 1,300 miles off the coast of Cape Cod at the time of the ex-plosion and holding a crew of over 20 men, the situation looked dire for the injured members of this crew. Boston Rescue Coordination Center was initially contacted for help, who reached out to two Canadian vessels in the area. However, these ships were 12 to 24 hours away, at the very least, and did not possess the necessary medical capability. It was then that the 106th Rescue Wing was called into immediate action to save those lives aboard the vessel. Less than 2 hours after the request was made by the Coast Guard, this seven-member crew, led by Major Sean Boughal, boarded a C–130 Hercules air-craft from the 102nd Rescue Squadron, also a part of the 106th Rescue Wing, to begin the search and rescue. Following a 5-hour flight and superb airmanship by the C–130 crew, the seven-man PJ team executed a complex night para-chute insertion of equipment and per-sonnel into the water and then made their way to the stricken vessel. After making it onboard, the 103rd Rescue Squadron PJ team provided ad-vanced medical care for the next 2 days until a Portuguese rescue helicopter could hoist the team off and airlift the injured seamen to a higher level of medical care. If not for the brave ac-tions of this rescue wing, there could very well have been a greater loss of life upon that vessel. Mr. Speaker, these pararescuemen risked life and limb to save these crew members and have more than earned our respect and admiration. Today I would like to honor Major Edward Boughal, Technical Sergeant Jordan St. Clair, Major Marty Viera, Senior Master Sergeant Erik Blom, Master Sergeant Jed Smith, Staff Sergeant Bryan Dalere, and Senior Airman Mi-chael Hartman for their lifesaving ef-forts on April 24. b1045 Not only today, but every day, men and women, like those in the 106th Res-cue Wing, put themselves on the line to protect us, our families, and our com-munities. It is so important that we continue to give our support to our Na-tion’s defenders and provide every needed resource for these heroes. All Americans should be very proud of the 106th Rescue Wing and their continued legacy of remarkably answering the call to duty.

RECOGNIZING KIDSPEACE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. F
ITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize KidsPeace, which is a private charity dedicated to assisting children and adolescents ex-periencing emotional, behavioral, and social challenges in Pennsylvania. Founded in 1882, KidsPeace provides a comprehensive range of residential treatment programs, accredited edu-cational services, and a variety of fos-ter care and community-based treat-ment programs to help people in need overcome challenges and transform their lives. Last week, I had the privilege of meeting Dominick DiSalvo and Pat-rick Slattery, advocates of KidsPeace Foster Care in Doylestown in my dis-trict, where they work with families affected by the opioid epidemic. Through the power of family living, kids who have emotional and behav-ioral challenges learn to participate in healthier relationships with adults, ex-perience healthy family functioning, witness positive parenting styles, par-ticipate in community life, and learn social skills through positive role mod-eling. I am proud of the efforts of KidsPeace to help Bucks County’s youth receive the information and treatment they need to become healthy adults. KidsPeace reminds us that we can all make a difference in the life of a child.

HEALTHCARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. D
UNCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I received this message from a very respected busi-nessman in Knoxville, Randy Greaves. He wrote: I just received a letter from Humana stat-ing that they are leaving the State of Ten-nessee next year. This leaves no one to write individual health policies in the State. Aetna only writes group policies, and they may with-draw, as well. Please let anyone with a vote know that families are being failed miser-ably, as you already know. The insurance that Humana wrote for my family, in 2017, required that we pay the first $37,000 between premiums and the deductible before insurance would contribute only 50 percent. It was basically worthless, and now they won’t even make that lousy policy available because people on subsidies, mostly with no personal accountability for their own health, cost a fortune to the rest of us. 
ObamaCare may have helped 20 mil-lion people, but it has hurt 200 million people in the process. About a month ago, The Irish Times, the largest newspaper in Ireland, re-ported that they had over 660,000 people on waiting lists for healthcare. That is in a country of less than 5 million peo-ple. If you multiply that times 60 or 65, you have got the United States. Medicare, when it started, when it was first passed, there was a CBO pre-diction that it would cost $9 billion after 25 years. Instead, it cost 12 times that after the first 25 years, and now it costs six times more than that, or about 70 times more than the original estimates. California, as liberal and leftwing as that State is, a few days ago, I read that they tried to pass a healthcare, or medical care for everyone, bill. They had to withdraw the bill because they found out that it would cost $400 bil-lion for the first year. If you multiply that times 10 or 11, you are talking about the whole United States. We are having trouble affording the Medicare that we have now for 14 percent of the population, so Medicare for everyone is not going to work in this country. We took what was a very minor prob-lem, for very few people in the mid-six-ties, and turned it into a major prob-lem for everyone so that now only War-ren Buffett and Bill Gates, and people like that, multibillionaires, can afford healthcare. And the reason is, is that anything the Federal Government sub-sidizes, the costs just explode because you remove the incentives and pres-sures to hold costs down. The American people don’t want a Russian or Cuban type of medical sys-tem in this country. They don’t want a totally federally run system, like they have in so many countries, with med-ical care that is not even a fraction of what we have. We are still under ObamaCare today, and it is not working. These insurance companies are pulling out all over the whole country, and The Washington Times reported yesterday, or the day before, that, according to the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services, premiums went up 63 percent in Ten-nessee in 2017 alone.

RECOGNIZING STEVE BANTA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. F
ARENTHOLD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to recognize a great American patriot, Captain Steve Banta, call-sign ‘‘Slash,’’ who will be retiring this week from his post as commanding officer of Naval Air Sta-tion Corpus Christi. A 1991 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in engineering, Cap-tain Banta completed primary naval aviation training with the VT–27 Boomers at NAS Corpus Christi, and was designated a naval aviator on March 18, 1994. His sea duty included deployments on various cruisers, destroyers, frigates to the Mediterranean, Arabian Gulf, Car-ibbean, Southeast Pacific, and other areas. During his deployment as main-tenance officer with HSL–44 Detach-ment Four, they were the first in the fleet to test the Hellfire missile. On September 11, 2001, he was de-ployed on the USS Carl Vinson with Carrier Group Three. During the first 4 months of Operation Enduring Free-dom, he coordinated the daily schedule of more than 40 helicopters in 16 dif-ferent aviation units. In 2009 and 2010, he served as commanding officer of the world famous HSL–48 Vipers. During his tenure, they earned multiple awards for tactical and retention excel-lence. Captain Banta’s shore duties includes tours as a Seahawk helicopter flight instructor, as an analyst in the Pen-tagon for the Navy’s role in Operation Enduring Freedom, and as the lead country program director for Afghani-stan with the Defense Security Co-operation Agency. He earned a master’s degree in na-tional security strategy at the Na-tional War College in 2011. Captain Banta assumed command of Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on June 26, 2014. During his tour, improve-ments in infrastructure, program man-agement, and quality of life resulted in numerous awards, including Depart-ment of Defense Fire Department of the Year, Fire Department National Accreditation, SECNAV Gold Award for Energy and Water Management, and CNO Shore Safety Award. The Wingspan Newspaper was ranked num-ber one in the Navy, and the base was on the A-list for outstanding customer satisfaction in family housing, and more. Captain Banta has been an invaluable asset to the Navy, south Texas, and the United States. I wish him and his wife, Sarah, a Corpus Christi native, best of luck as he moves into civilian life and begins his new job as executive director of the USS Lexington Museum on the Bay. Thank you, Captain Banta, for your service. f

So believing You know what we have need of before we even ask, together we offer this prayer as taught by Your Son, Jesus Christ: Our Father, which art in Heaven, hal-lowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.

WELCOMING CHAPLAIN MARSHALL DUNBAR The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. B

Chaplain Dunbar is the vice president of Spiritual Life and interim vice presi-dent of Programs for Christian Com-munity Action, one of the largest pri-vate nonprofits in north Texas. He has an extensive record of service to our country and the north Texas commu-nity, including years in active military service, law enforcement, and home-land security. Chaplain Dunbar was commissioned into the United States Army Reserve Chaplain Corps as a chaplain candidate in 2011, beginning his chaplaincy career at the VA Hospital in Dallas. In 2014, he ended his military career as a first lieutenant. Chaplain Dunbar holds a B.S. in min-istry and leadership from Dallas Chris-tian College and a master of divinity in chaplaincy from Liberty Baptist Theo-logical Seminary. He is currently working toward his doctor of ministry degree in Christian leadership and spir-itual formation at Dallas Theological Seminary. I am grateful to Chaplain Dunbar for his service to north Texans and the American people. It is a true pleasure to have him here in the House, along with his wife, Melinda, and daughter, Elle-Simone. We are grateful for his service and we welcome him to the House.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Captive Nations Week. In 1959, Congress authorized and re-quested the President proclaim the third week in July as Captive Nations Week. During this week, we stand united with those who still live under the rule of communist regimes as they continue fighting against this oppres-sion and lack of human rights. You have my word that I will continue to fight along with you. As a way to educate current and fu-ture generations about the ideology, history, and societal impact of com-munism, the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation was authorized in 1993 by a unanimous act of Congress. In honor of this foundation, I have introduced H. Con. Res. 57, which ex-presses the sense of Congress that es-tablishing a museum in memory of the victims of communism is an important step in educating Americans about the human rights violations committed by these totalitarian regimes and telling the whole story of 20th century his-tory. This museum would honor the mem-ory of the heroes who resisted com-munist tyranny and commemorate America’s more than half a century of efforts resisting Soviet imperialism. I ask my colleagues to join me during Captive Nations Week in recognizing and supporting victims of communism by cosponsoring H. Con. Res. 57 and bringing the truth to light. f 
BUDGET FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, many of us are engaged in the budget process today. A budget for Americans should be the playbook for improving the quality of lives for all Americans. Yet this draco-nian budget, which is worse than the Trump budget, cuts $250 billion-plus out of quality of life issues for Ameri-cans. It cuts education, healthcare, Medicaid, Medicare, and the environ-ment, undermining the fight against climate change. Where is the relief for the American people? We have the fact that wages are slow in growing. Mr. Speaker, corporate America is doing well, and all that is needed, as some corporations have al-ready done, is to raise the salaries of Americans. We also need to make sure the gov-ernment does what the American peo-ple need, to shore up the Affordable Care Act, but not cut billions from it. Shore up national defense, but not cut from diplomacy and engagement in peacekeeping activities, as well as USAID. Shore up America’s national security. Give a quality of life to our young people so that jobs are created. How do you do that? You do that, Mr. Speaker, by ensur-ing that the climate and quality of life issues are there for corporations to grow. Growth is important for the American people, not draconian cuts to leave Americans without healthcare, without good climate, and without edu-cation. We want a budget for the Amer-ican people. SAVING PRECIOUS WELFARE DOLLARS (Mr. POLIQUIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, sadly, rural Maine is ground zero for the opioid epidemic in America. Every day, on average, Mr. Speaker, one fellow Mainer dies from an over-dose. Sixty percent of our families are impacted one way or another from this scourge. For years, Mr. Speaker, law enforce-ment officials in Maine have found electronic benefit transfer cards, or EBT cards, at drug busts. Every month, these EBT cards are replenished with food stamps and other welfare benefits intended to help disadvantaged fami-lies. But too often these valuable cards are used to buy drugs. Mr. Speaker, this has got to stop. I have found a commonsense way to do that. My Food Stamp Integrity Act permanently disqualifies anyone con-victed of drug trafficking from receiv-ing food stamps. This will help make sure limited welfare benefits are saved to compassionately help moms and dads put food on the table for hungry kids. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3151 will require able-bodied adults without dependents, between the ages of 18 and 50, work at least 20 hours per week, job train, or perform community service in order for taxpayers to help them out with food assistance. Mr. Speaker, similar reforms in Maine have helped lift thousands out of poverty and into independence and bet-ter lives through employment. We have plenty of jobs available. My bill will help save precious wel-fare dollars for the disabled, elderly, sick, and the poor. It will also help stop deadly drug trafficking and treat taxpayers better. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3151 is a Maine commonsense solution to a national problem. I ask everyone in this Cham-ber, Republicans and Democrats, to vote for it.

LET’S WORK TOGETHER ON HEALTHCARE (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, Repub-licans have threatened to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act for 7 years, but earlier this week, they failed again to deliver on this threat. So next week, the Senate will vote on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. If this bill were to pass, 32 million people will lose their health insurance, insurance premiums will go up, and in-surance markets will unravel. That is exactly why this bill will not pass. But M
ITCH MCCONNELL and the Republican leadership are going to have a vote anyway.

ROLLING BACK FEDERAL REGULATIONS (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a rebounding com-munity in the Eighth District of Indi-ana. Sullivan County, Indiana, is located in central western Indiana, along the Wabash River. It is home to roughly 21,000 proud, hardworking Hoosiers. The local economy relies on manufac-turing and the coal and transportation industries. In the first 6 months of this new ad-ministration, we have worked with the Trump administration to roll back the aggressive, job-killing Federal regula-tions of the last 8 years that have dev-astated this area of the country. The agenda we have set forth of less regula-tion and lower taxes is breathing life into our local economies and commu-nities like Sullivan, Indiana. As of May 2017, the unemployment rate in Sullivan County is at a 27-year low, sitting at 3.3 percent. Just a year ago, the unemployment was 7 percent. Mr. Speaker, as we continue to work on behalf of the American people, I am hopeful this trend continues.

b1215 RUSSIAN CYBER ATTACKS (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, inaction from this House leaves us open to Rus-sian cyber attacks against our democ-racy, and the numbers tell the story. Sixteen months since Russians at-tacked, this House stands mute. Eleven months since all four major U.S. intel-ligence agencies confirmed Putin’s di-rect involvement, and we have done nothing. Eight Russians and Trump advisers met to discuss illegal Russian Govern-ment assistance to the Trump cam-paign, 3 hours of face-to-face meetings between President Trump and Putin, one of those hours with absolutely no accountability to the American people, and 98 out of 100 Senators voted in favor of new Russian sanctions 34 days ago. And finally zero. Zero action from this House to fight back. Zero show of bipartisanship that mirrors our Senate counterparts. Zero votes on the House floor to send the sanctions bill to the President. Mr. Speaker, if you allow us to vote on this bill, it will pass with over-whelming bipartisan support. And if you do not allow us to get Russia sanc-tions to the President’s desk and put the pressure on him to sign it, you and the rest of this majority in the House will carry the weight of our failure to stand up to Russia back to your dis-tricts in August, and no one will under-stand how it is that you show weakness when it is strength that is required in the face of Russian aggression. That is what America expects and deserves. f 
RECOGNITION OF ELI BOROCHOV (Mr. M
CKINLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. M
CKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize a little known role model, Eli Borochov, a 22-year-old young man from Cedarhurst, New York. While on a trip to Israel with his family in 2015, Eli was praying during a Shabbat service at the Cave of the Pa-triarchs in Hebron. While praying, Eli was targeted by a pair of Arab snipers and was shot twice in the leg. Thank-fully, after emergency surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation, Eli has recov-ered. After the terrorists were apprehended and put on trial, Eli was called upon to speak in court, which meant he had to face his shooters in person. While ad-dressing the court, Eli displayed con-viction and character well beyond his years. As Eli mentioned in his statement, the only reason he was targeted was the fact that he was practicing his Jewish faith. I commend Eli for stand-ing tall in the face of violence and showing great courage. He is a role model.

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION (Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about one of the most basic rights that serves as the cornerstone of our democracy, and that is freedom of speech, freedom of expression for all Americans guaranteed in the First Amendment in our Bill of Rights. It is the freedom of press; it is the freedom of assembly; it is the freedom to peti-tion. This morning, I joined with several fellow Members of Congress and other Americans to exercise this First Amendment freedom in a demonstra-tion outside the Turkish Ambassador’s residence, the same place where mem-bers of Turkish President Erdogan’s se-curity forces attacked 11 peaceful Americans who were exercising their freedom of speech on May 16. This morning, we stood together to demand the protection of the freedom of expression. We stood together to say that we will never stop fighting for those basic freedoms that are en-shrined in our Bill of Rights and pro-tected by our Constitution. Americans have fought for over 241 years and shed blood to protect our basic freedoms that we hold most dear-ly. As Supreme Court Justice Cardozo stated in 1937, freedom of expression is ‘‘the indispensable condition of nearly every other form of freedom’’ that we cherish in our country. f 
CELEBRATING ST. CLOUD FEDERAL CREDIT UNION (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the St. Cloud Fed-eral Credit Union for being named one of the top 150 workplaces in Minnesota by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The companies selected were based off of a survey done by Workplace Dy-namics, which measured the employ-ees’ opinions on engagement, organiza-tional health, and overall satisfaction at their company. This is a wonderful achievement for the St. Cloud Federal Credit Union as Workplace Dynamics surveyed nearly 70,000 employees throughout Minnesota to come up with these results. For every company, no matter how big or small, the employees are the key to securing success. The hard work they put in every day is critical, so it is imperative that management en-sures they feel both valued and re-spected. I want to congratulate everyone at the St. Cloud Federal Credit Union on their incredible teamwork, and I espe-cially want to congratulate manage-ment for creating a great workplace for their employees. Your company and employees will continue to thrive due to your leadership. Keep up the good work.

AWARENESS FOR TYPE 1 DIABETES (Mr. REED asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness for the issue of type 1 diabetes across America. As co-chair of the Congressional Dia-betes Caucus on the Republican side with my good friend, D
IANA DEGETTE , on the Democratic side, this is an issue I care deeply about. We must work to-gether to find ways to address this dis-ease to improve the lives of families that are dealing with this each and every day. Mr. Speaker, my family is one of these families. My son, Will, at 17 years of age, has been fighting this disease 24/ 7, 365 days a year since the age of 4. This young girl, Kennedy, I had the honor to meet with and is representing my district here in the congressional workshop being put on by Juvenile Di-abetes Research Foundation. She showed me the scars on her fingers where she has to poke her fingers six to seven times a day, Mr. Speaker, to con-trol her blood sugar and monitor it on a regular basis. She is a true inspiration to all dia-betics across the Nation and should be an inspiration to each and every one of us to tackle this disease in a way that will improve lives for generations to come. 
f 
APPRENTICESHIP GRANTS BUDGET CUT (Mr. COURTNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, last February, President Trump had CEOs from America’s largest manufacturers to come and talk about progrowth tax policies. Instead of talking about taxes, what they really talked about is the real need out there, which is to close the skills gap in this country and get the job training out there so that peo-ple can get hired. USA Today reported the next day with the headline: ‘‘U.S. factory CEOs to Trump: Jobs exist; skills don’t.’’ In the 2017 budget, the bipartisan budget, Congress listened, and we appropriated robust funding for apprenticeship pro-grams, for youth job training pro-grams, and for adult, older incumbent job training programs. Incredibly, a few minutes ago, the partisan Republican budget cut appren-ticeship grants to zero, from 95 million from last year to zero. Mr. Speaker, better skills means better wages and better jobs. We should be investing strongly in job training programs so that people will have a future for them-selves and their families. We should listen to the job creators in this country. We should listen to the people back home, and we should reject this Republican budget which incred-ibly turns the clock back so that we can fill the job openings that the Labor Department says now total almost 6 million jobs in this country. Close the skills gaps. Invest in job training. f 
HONORING C.J. AND DAVE DUNKLEE (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize C.J. and Dave Dunklee, founders of The Healing Box Project. Mr. and Mrs. Dunklee are serv-ing our Nation’s veterans through pro-viding guitar lessons at the Truman VA Hospital in Columbia, Missouri. The Healing Box Project came to life at the Truman VA Hospital a couple of years ago. C.J. and Dave provide gui-tars, picks, and lessons to disabled vet-erans in order to help them ease the wounds that so many of them are fac-ing. These weekly lessons provide an out-let for veterans to use the joy of music to heal their souls. Weekly, they pro-vide these lessons for up to 50 veterans. C.J. and Dave provide the fundraising through their 501(c)(3) nonprofit to pay for the supplies and lessons needed to help this project succeed. I am thankful for their efforts to pro-vide services to our Nation’s heroes who have so graciously given service to our great country. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to take this opportunity to recognize C.J. and Dave for their efforts on behalf of our Nation’s veterans. I am blessed to rep-resent them in Congress and wish them continued success with this very spe-cial project.

HONORING MARYAM MIRZAKHANI (Mr. M
CNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. M
CNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of Maryam Mirzakhani. Maryam was born and raised in Iran where she was the first female on Iran’s International Mathematical Olympiad team, winning gold medals in 1994 and 1995, and was the first Iranian woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences. She moved to the United States to attend graduate school at Harvard Uni-versity and became a 2004 research fel-low of the Clay Mathematics Institute and a professor at Princeton Univer-sity. In 2008, she became a professor at Stanford University. In 2014, Maryam was the first woman ever to be be-stowed with the most prestigious mathematical award, the Fields Medal, for her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces. The Fields Medals are awarded every 4 years to people aged 40 or younger. Maryam was an amazing mathemati-cian, socially engaging, and involved in the local community. Maryam Mirzakhani died last week at the age of 40, a tragedy not only for her family and friends but for the additional beau-tiful mathematics she would have given the human race had she been blessed with a long career. f 
HONORING MONSIGNOR JOHN M
CSWEENEY (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Monsignor John McSweeney, priest of Charlotte’s St. Matthew Catholic Church, the largest Catholic parish in America, who retires this week after more than 40 years of ministry. He was actually the first priest or-dained in what was then the new Char-lotte Diocese back in 1974. Monsignor McSweeney is committed to the prin-ciple of servant leadership and of help-ing each member of his parish find their special God-given role in life and in the church. Despite his very public role, he often reminds folks that Jesus is the star of St. Matthew, not the priest. Monsignor McSweeney has another motto: ‘‘You never say no to Jesus.’’ And so, still listening to Jesus at age 75, Monsignor McSweeney is retiring from America’s largest Catholic parish to move on to Haiti or Jamaica to live among the poor and minister to their needs. May God bless Monsignor McSweeney in this next phase of ministry.

We have learned on our trips that nothing is more important for global security than the develop-ment of human capital, and what bet-ter example could there be than these remarkable girls. I want to echo the sentiments of Af-ghanistan’s First Lady and say to the girls, ‘‘Saar Bolan demoom kar deen,’’ literally, ‘‘You make us hold our heads up high.’’ We are proud of you. Mr. Speaker, it is important to re-member that, when these girls were born, women were not allowed to get an education in Afghanistan. Now, be-cause of the bravery of these girls and the tireless efforts of their teachers, the rest of the world can now see how remarkable Afghan women truly are. Congratulations on your remarkable achievement.

CHIEF JAMES CARMODY, WYO-MING, MICHIGAN POLICE DE-PARTMENT, MICHIGAN POLICE CHIEF OF THE YEAR (Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a humble public servant and someone, frankly, I am proud to call a friend, Chief James Carmody of the Wyoming, Michigan, Police Department, who was recently named Michigan Police Chief of the Year. Jim Carmody began his career in 1975 as a police officer in Port Huron, Michigan, where he rose to the rank of deputy chief. In 2006, Jim made the de-cision to join the Wyoming Police De-partment as chief and call west Michi-gan home. Chief Carmody has led the charge to strengthen the relationship between police officers and the community that they serve, while providing the resi-dents of Wyoming, Michigan, with top-notch law enforcement. Chief Carmody’s relentless commit-ment to public safety doesn’t end there. He also chairs the Michigan Po-lice Chiefs’ Traffic Safety Committee and was recently appointed to serve on the Governor’s Traffic Safety Commis-sion. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Second District of Michigan, I congratulate Chief Carmody on being named the top Michigan Police Chief for 2016. We thank him for his 42—and keep count-ing—years of service to Michigan and to our Nation.

CONGRATULATING VIRGIN IS-LANDS WOMEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM, AND THANKING RAKEEM CHRISTMAS AND THE CHIRSTIANSTED HILLSIDERS (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to congratulate the Virgin Is-lands women’s basketball team on win-ning the gold medal at the 2017 Centrobasket Championship and fin-ishing the tournament with a 4–1 record. They beat out teams from Mex-ico, Central America, and the Carib-bean. I particularly want to congratulate Natalie Day, who was named MVP, with a tournament double-double aver-age, 18.6 points and 11 rebounds per game. Good luck to the Virgin Islands wom-en’s team at the FIBA Women’s AmeriCup 2017 in Buenos Aires, Argen-tina. We are rooting for you. I also want to congratulate another Virgin Islander, Rakeem Christmas, who, for the last 2 years, has played center for the NBA’s Indiana Pacers. I want to thank Rakeem for return-ing home to St. Croix repeatedly and hosting a series of youth events, and for opening a basketball court funded by his foundation for the Frederiksted Boys and Girls Club. He and other ath-letes will coach basketball camps on St. Thomas and St. Croix this week, with the highlight of an all-star com-petition on St. Croix’s Educational Complex. Finally, to the Hillsiders, who host their annual picnic this weekend, thank you so much for continuing the tradition of the Hillsiders of Christian-sted. I will be there to celebrate with you as we remember culture and fam-ily, united in pride and hope. f 
RISING MEDICAL PREMIUMS (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago The Washington Times published a chart from the De-partment of Health and Human Serv-ices showing that medical premiums went up 116 percent last year in Ari-zona, 69 percent in Oklahoma, 63 per-cent in my home State of Tennessee, 59 percent in Minnesota, 58 percent in Alaska, and on and on and on. President Obama promised, if we would pass his healthcare bill, that people could keep their plans, yet mil-lions were forced onto ObamaCare be-cause either their premiums went up too high or they lost their insurance altogether. He promised that the aver-age family would save $2,500 a year. It has been almost impossible to find any family that has saved that $2,500. ObamaCare has been great: great in making healthcare unaffordable for al-most every family in America.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentle-woman from Wyoming? There was no objection. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 454, which provides a structured rule for the con-sideration of H.R. 2910, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act; H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy In-frastructure Act; and H.R. 218, the King Cove Road Land Exchange Act. Mr. Speaker, our domestic energy in-dustry has suffered greatly over the last 8 years under outdated regulations and burdensome bureaucratic red tape that have prohibited growth and inno-vation. Today’s rule allows for consid-eration of two very important bills that will provide clear and transparent policies for our pipeline permitting processes, making them more efficient and effective so that we can fully real-ize the North American energy boom; create American jobs; grow our econ-omy; and strengthen our relations with our largest energy trading partners, Canada and Mexico. The first bill, H.R. 2910, the Pro-moting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, is sponsored by my colleague, Mr. FLORES  of Texas. b1245 This bill reinforces the Federal En-ergy Regulatory Commission’s role as the lead agency for siting interstate natural gas pipelines by directing it to identify and invite all agencies consid-ering an aspect of an application to es-tablish a schedule for concurrent re-views, and to impose deadlines for final decisions. Recent advancements in energy ex-ploration have allowed companies to tap into previously inaccessible nat-ural gas reserves, leading to a dramatic increase in domestic production. The increased supply has lowered energy costs and increased demand for natural gas. As a result, current U.S. pipelines are now operating near capacity, making new pipelines necessary to deliver gas to consumers across the Nation, espe-cially to those in the Northeast and Midwest, where demand for energy is high, but where they lack the infra-structure to deliver domestic natural gas. Additionally, due to its abundance and affordability, many manufacturers are beginning to rely on natural gas as a primary fuel. Unfortunately, the permitting proc-ess for new pipelines is arduous and un-necessarily burdensome. Currently, when siting a pipeline project, multiple permits are required, including permits under the Clean Water Act, the Endan-gered Species Act, and the Clean Air Act, for example. According to the Government Accountability Office, the average processing time from pre-filing to certification for interstate natural gas pipelines has been 558 days. We can-not afford to wait that long, Mr. Speaker. It is critical that we expand and mod-ernize our Nation’s pipeline infrastruc-ture to ensure the access to affordable energy and affordable prices for con-sumers across the country. In order to do this, we simply must promote time-ly and efficient reviews as well as co-ordination among Federal, State, and local regulators. This bill accomplishes these goals, and I support its passage. The rule we are discussing today also provides for consideration of H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy In-frastructure Act, sponsored by the gen-tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. M
ULLIN ). This bill creates a uniform and trans-parent process to authorize the con-struction, connection, operation, and maintenance of international transfers of oil, natural gas, and electricity im-ports and exports. The bill directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to review cross-border oil and natural gas pipe-lines and the Department of Energy to review cross-border electric trans-mission facilities, requiring the rel-evant official to issue a certificate of crossing, unless it is found not to be in the public interest.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5993 July 19, 2017 
Recent advances in technology, Mr. Speaker, have dramatically increased our ability to harness our vast natural resources, but the current ad hoc per-mitting process has inhibited energy producers from exporting American- made energy to our international trad-ing partners and has significantly de-layed recent proposals, such as the Keystone XL pipeline. The value of energy traded between the United States and its North Amer-ican neighbors exceeded $140 billion in 2015, with $100 billion in U.S. energy imports, and over $40 billion in exports. We simply cannot afford to gamble our energy security and competitiveness on an inefficient permitting process. Today’s rule, Mr. Speaker, also al-lows for consideration of H.R. 218, the King Cove Road Land Exchange Act, sponsored by the gentleman from Alas-ka (Mr. Y
OUNG ). This bill authorizes an equal value land exchange to facilitate the construction of an 11-mile road linking the remote city of King Cove and the city of Cold Bay, which has a modern airport. The State of Alaska will transfer approximately 43,000 acres to the Department of the Interior to add to the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in return for 206 acres of Fed-eral lands to build the road. This road is critical, Mr. Speaker, be-cause harsh winter conditions make transporting individuals in the remote King Cove community of nearly 1,000 people dangerous and sometimes fatal: gale-force winds ground planes and pre-vent sea travel; evacuations can take days; and the hovercraft terminal and medical facility that Congress tempo-rarily provided funds for, in lieu of land for the road, ceased operation in 2010. The King Cove community has been denied proper hospital care and access to essential emergency services since they began fighting for this road 40 years ago, and that, Mr. Speaker, is un-acceptable. Ensuring these folks have ground transportation options for accessing the regional hub at Cold Bay, espe-cially during harsh winters, is vital to the safety of this community in emer-gency situations. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for the rule for these impor-tant bills, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume, and I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for yielding me the cus-tomary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today would put some of our most sen-sitive lands at risk and limit the voices of experts, all to further construction of dangerous projects that could harm local communities. First, H.R. 2883 undermines the Na-tional Environmental Policy Act and tips the scales in favor of massive, con-troversial oil and gas pipeline and elec-tric transmission projects. Trans-boundary projects like this often travel for hundreds of miles, last for decades, and pass through sensitive and Native lands and important aquifers. And, as we all know, pipelines leak. That is why there is currently a rig-orous Federal review process that takes into account the impact of these projects on the environment and the communities along their route. Today, in order to construct an oil pipeline, a natural gas pipeline, or an electrical transmission line that crosses the U.S. border with Canada or Mexico, a Presidential permit must first be obtained, as well as additional approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission—FERC—the Department of Energy, or the Depart-ment of Defense, depending on the type of pipeline. This review process helps us to un-derstand the environmental impact of these projects and it allows commu-nities and landowners along the route to weigh in with their concerns. All of this helps to keep communities safe from hazardous substances that, if spilled or ignited, could have cata-strophic consequences. Yet the major-ity is proposing this measure to se-verely limit that rigorous review. The bill effectively exempts these massive projects from environmental and safety review under the National Environmental Policy Act. It narrows the approval process and environ-mental review to just the ‘‘cross-border segment’’ of projects that physically cross the border with Canada or Mexico rather than, presently, the entire trans-boundary project. So inside the United States, anything goes. Instead of requiring an agency to af-firmatively find a project is in the pub-lic interest, the bill also places a bur-den of proof on the opponents of the project to show that it is not in the public interest. If that wasn’t bad enough, the legislation would also give new life to the controversial projects that have already been denied, for very good reason, by allowing permits to be resubmitted under this sham process. Second, H.R. 2910 would supercharge the natural gas pipeline approval proc-ess, putting private property rights in jeopardy and hindering important envi-ronmental reviews. The bill gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission almost com-plete authority and severely limits the input of expert entities tasked with protecting the environment, our nat-ural resources, and public health. Mr. Speaker, I want to remind those watching today just how streamlined the natural gas pipeline approval proc-ess already is. The Federal Energy Reg-ulatory Commission is basically a rub-ber-stamp entity. It almost never de-nies a pipeline project. On average, 88 percent of projects are approved within 1 year, and then we think about the consequences later. In fact, FERC officials have testified that what is mostly slowing down the applications is that the applicants themselves fail to submit the necessary information to perform congressionally mandated project reviews. So this bill is a solution in search of a problem. Third, H.R. 218 revives an ill-advised proposal to build a road to the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and its world- class wetlands. This proposal has been, as pointed out for a number of decades, rejected by multiple State and Federal agencies on numerous occasions over the past 30 years. It has been exhaustively studied time and time again, and, every single time, the results have been clear. The road is not the most viable option for the residents of King Cove and would do irreparable damage to the refuge. Yet the majority is ignoring three decades of expert analysis and public input in an effort to green light this damaging road through a congression-ally designated wilderness area. More efficient and viable options exist, in-cluding the addition of a heliport and construction of a new airport, which we should be focusing on because a road is the wrong approach. Mr. Speaker, we all know this, but I think we do need to be reminded from time to time that we are the stewards of our environment and this planet and the land only while we are alive. None of us ever really own it. We do, how-ever, have an obligation to protect it, care for it, and make sure that it exists for future generations. These bills fail that test. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Y
OUNG ), my friend and colleague, and the sponsor of H.R. 218. (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I listened to people on the other side. This is a good rule. I want to com-pliment the Rules Committee. It is crucially important to recognize that this is an issue that means lives: 19 people have died out of that commu-nity of King Cove—mothers, children, husbands, brothers, uncles, and aunts— because they didn’t have a road. We passed legislation similar to this in 2009 that granted a land exchange— and was a massive land exchange—of 43,000 acres for 260 acres from the State of Alaska to construct this road. I think that is a fair exchange for an 11- mile road—single lane, gravel cov-ered—just so they have access to save lives. Those who speak against it have never experienced the wind that howls through that area when you try to land a plane or take off, you have a sick per-son with you, and you crash. Or go across the bay when waves are 30 feet high, and the evacuation of those ill people to an area that is only 11 miles away on an unfinished road and they die. Human beings, Alaskan constitu-ents, that have medical aid only 600 miles away and stopped by 11 miles that is not allowed because supposedly there is a better way. And there is no

better way than a road in the weather condition I am speaking of. When you think about it, I often lis-ten to the other side of the aisle in vot-ing against something like this, yet they will defend the right to save cer-tain animals, but they don’t want to save human life. That is wrong. This is a good project. It should be built. I am hoping this body recognizes that lives are important and recognize the fact that this road doesn’t disturb any of the wildlife. It is ironic that they will say it is going to disturb the geese that live off of eelgrass. The clos-est road that comes to this one bay is 11 miles away—11 miles. And the same area as this wildlife range has miles of road in it already, miles of road al-ready in place. One of those roads al-ready in place goes right by the lagoon where the tourists go watch the geese. Now, why can’t a tourist go by an area and watch the geese and it doesn’t disturb them, but if someone is sick, dying, in a bus, ambulance, car, or truck, that is going to disturb the geese? This is a nonsense argument by envi-ronmental communities around this Nation that want to put a stop to any-thing that benefits mankind and save the wildlife, say from New York or San Francisco, and don’t know what they are talking about. b1300 My job is to protect my people. This is not going to cost the taxpayers a nickel. This is going to be a project that is well done, and it will not dis-turb the wildlife they are so-called try-ing to protect. So I ask my colleagues on this floor to think about humanity. Think about that person, be it your mother, your daughter, your son, your aunt, your uncle, your brother, and you would want to see them die because they are trying to protect a goose? Shame on you. Shame on those who vote against this bill, saying: This is more important—I live in New York or California. This goose is more impor-tant than human life. I think it is time we use a little sense in this body, a little understanding. Let’s build this road. Let’s pass this bill. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative P
ASCRELL of New Jersey’s Bring Jobs Home Act, H.R. 685. This bill will close the tax loophole that rewards companies from moving jobs overseas, while providing a tax credit to companies that move jobs back to the United States. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-sent to insert the text of my amend-ment in the R
ECORD , along with extra-neous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. M
ITCHELL ). Is there objection to the re-quest of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ) to discuss our proposal. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and spokes-man for the other side. Before I give my remarks, I don’t think this is an either/or proposition, Mr. Speaker. Some of the things that my friend from Alaska just talked about make sense. There is nothing more essential than life. But this is a bill that has been put in with other bills as well. So I rise in opposition to the rule, Mr. Speaker. This week, the Ways and Means Sub-committee on Trade held our first hearing of the year, which was on NAFTA. You would think, from the President’s rhetoric on trade, that many on the other side in Congress would be focused on creating good-pay-ing, middle-class jobs and boosting our manufacturing base. You would think that. But, instead, we are here debat-ing a bill, a number of bills, that are an assault on private property rights and the environment in the name of cor-porate profit and expediency. Lo, what happened in 1923 that led to a change in our Tax Code when we tried to privatize public property and public resources. It was the biggest scandal of the 20th century. Where are the jobs that were sup-posed to be coming back from overseas under this administration? Where are the higher middle class wages? Where are the policies coming from this Con-gress that support workers and their families? The majority of Americans, Mr. Speaker, agree that keeping United States jobs from moving overseas should be a top priority. Yet, despite the empty promises made by this President, the flow of jobs overseas has not stopped by any barometer. This administration has awarded government contracts to companies that continue to offshore our jobs. Think about that. Our tax money is still going to corporate America that sends jobs overseas to help those com-panies send jobs overseas. Now, if that makes any sense, I will listen to the ra-tionale. We don’t stop companies from offshoring American jobs by holding rallies. We do it by making good pol-icy, an exercise this administration and this majority-led Congress have re-fused to engage in. If they want to change that, they can start right now. Under current law, when companies move overseas, we give them a tax break for the cost—a tax break. That is the law. We need to stop offshoring now. The Congress can defeat the previous ques-tion and bring up the Bring Jobs Home Act. This bill eliminates this tax de-duction and gives a tax credit of up to 20 percent of the cost to United States businesses that bring jobs back to the United States of America. The compa-nies would have to add jobs to claim the credit. I have also introduced legislation, the Jobs and Trade Competitiveness Act, that builds on the Bring Jobs Home Act and further strengthens en-forcement against countries that cheat our trade laws. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield an addi-tional 2 minutes to the gentleman. Mr. PASCRELL. I encourage my col-leagues to look at it. So let’s stop subsidizing companies that ship jobs overseas and start bring-ing jobs back to our shores. It doesn’t get much simpler than that, Mr. Speaker. This is not a new idea. President Obama and Democrats in Congress have raised this bill for years. The Re-publican House has blocked our bill at every turn. Senator S
TABENOW of Michigan leads this bill in the Senate, where it cleared a procedural vote in 2014, 93–7. President Trump has declared this week Made In America Week. I chal-lenge you today to stop the small talk and put your money where your mouth is. Take up and pass this bill to stand up for American manufacturing and the workers here at home who need it. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question so we can bring up the Bring Jobs Home Act and start bringing jobs back to the United States. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I share my colleague’s dedication to job creation, and what we know is that the kind of job creation we need in this Nation can only come with access to reliable, affordable sources of energy. Our fossil fuels in this country are a national treasure, and these bills that are being considered under this rule today are bills that would help to streamline the regulatory process. We have been, Mr. Speaker, really facing a war on fossil fuels during the course of the last 8 years. We have seen these industries targeted, completely unfairly targeted, based on some no-tion that, by shutting down our fossil fuel industry, we are somehow going to be able to continue to have economic growth. We have seen the environ-mental officials of the previous admin-istration even admit before this body that things like the Clean Power Plan would result, if fully implemented, in a negligible impact on the environment. So, again, I think that it is impor-tant to recognize that it is at the cen-ter of the agenda that we are pushing forward, frankly, with historic progress in this Congress to begin to generate the kind of economic growth that we really need to get back on track. We have been stagnant now for 8 years. We have seen overreach from the Federal Government. We have seen a situation in which companies, indus-try, individuals, and small businesses are strangled by regulatory red tape.

No one is suggesting that there shouldn’t be oversight. No one is sug-gesting that there shouldn’t be envi-ronmental review, but what we know is we have got to streamline it. We cannot be in a position where bu-reaucrats—and, frankly, it is often unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.—impose absolutely unattainable restrictions, impose rules that our in-dustry can’t meet and prevent us from being able to have access to our own energy sources. Again, it is that reli-able, affordable energy that will allow our economy to grow and bring back the jobs that the gentleman says, and to which I agree, are so important for this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. W
ILLIAMS ). Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to speak on be-half of H.R. 2910, Promoting Inter-agency Coordination for Review of Nat-ural Gas Pipelines Act, and the poten-tial impact it could have on our Na-tion. Right now, the Federal Energy Regu-latory Commission, or FERC, is the lead agency for coordinating required reviews and authorizations for inter-state natural gas pipelines. In order to start a pipeline project, you need mul-tiple permits from a variety of plat-forms as well as coordination from Federal, State, and local governments. As history has shown us time and time again, a multistep approval proc-ess just does not work. Mixing three different levels of government has and always will be a recipe for total dis-aster. It makes for unnecessary delays that are caused by too many cooks in the kitchen. I fully support my friend and col-league Representative B
ILL FLORES ’ bill that will promote more timely and efficient reviews. We need to strength-en FERC’s lead agency role that it was designed to create accountability and transparency. Overall, this bill will encourage more timely and efficient reviews and keep energy prices affordable for all Ameri-cans. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my col-leagues to support this rule and the un-derlying bill. In God we trust. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. C
ICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I rise in opposition to the rule and urge my colleagues to defeat the pre-vious question so that we can take up the legislation that has just been out-lined by Mr. P
ASCRELL . There is no more responsibility that we have than creating good-paying jobs for the American people; and this is, after all, according to President Trump, ‘‘Make It in America’’ Week, which, in fact, is a centerpiece of the Democratic agenda. We have a number of bills that are designed to help rein-vigorate and strengthen American manufacturing. It is shocking for the American peo-ple to learn that we have a Tax Code, as Mr. PASCRELL outlined, that gives a tax break to companies that ship American jobs overseas, exactly the op-posite of what it should be if we are really concerned about creating good- paying jobs here in our own country. So defeating the previous question means we could take up the stop offshoring now legislation, which would get rid of this nonsensical provi-sion in our Tax Code. When you go out there and talk to constituents, you say: One of the rea-sons we can’t keep good manufacturing jobs here in America is because we incentivize, we use some of your tax dollars to incentivize companies to ship those jobs overseas. It makes no sense. So how about, during ‘‘Make It in America’’ Week, rather than just using that phrase, as the President has done, let’s do something that will actually help promote making things in this country—I know, probably a chal-lenging concept for the President, who does his manufacturing overseas, not in the United States. Let’s take a bold step today. Remove that provision of the Tax Code, and have a Tax Code provision that actu-ally incentivizes creating jobs in our own country and giving tax credits to companies that create jobs in America. What a novel idea. I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can take this piece of legislation up, and perhaps it will then encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to move forward on a number of bills that are part of the Democratic Make It in America agenda to help rebuild Amer-ican manufacturing and put people back to work in good-paying jobs. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I understand that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don’t want to talk about energy. They don’t want to talk about fossil fuels. They don’t want to talk about how important these are to the economy. I would propose, Mr. Speaker, maybe what we should do is turn out the lights in this Chamber. Maybe we ought to turn off the air conditioning, Mr. Speaker, and we could have the de-bate in the dark, which is where we would be, frankly, if we followed the energy policies in the approach of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. These bills are hugely important, Mr. Speaker, to ensure that we are able to continue to get access to the energy that we need; and it is crucially impor-tant that we not skip over the burden that has been caused by the Federal Government, by the regulatory burden we have been feeling, and that we take action, as is our responsibility, to begin to help to roll back that over-reach, to begin to help to provide some relief so that we can, in fact, get the jobs back that our colleagues say they desire so much and that we know we need. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. K
ING). Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to be recognized by the gen-tlewoman from Wyoming, and I rise in support of this combined rule that we have here. I thought it was important that I speak to some of the provisions that are in the underlying bill and also the provisions that are not in the under-lying bill. b1315 I would characterize this rule, that is the rule for the reauthorization of the Department of Homeland Security—it is actually the authorization. It has never been authorized in that fashion before—the authorization of Homeland Security after 15 years. I think that it does a lot of good things in that it lays out a definition and frames the duties of the Department of Homeland Secu-rity broadly and pretty closely in their entirety. There are some things that are miss-ing from this that I would like to have plugged into this reauthorization lan-guage. However, I believe the goal was, all along, to draft a piece of reauthor-ization language that would be, I will say, compatible to both sides of the aisle and without particular dissent. Therefore, we have a piece of legisla-tion that isn’t as impactful as I would like, and yet it is here on the floor under suspension with the idea that we can move this along and frame the De-partment of Homeland Security’s du-ties in the fashion that is here. I don’t object to the provisions that are in the authorization language that exists, but I would point out that it sets the stage, and now there is an agreement that has been reached through a number of entities, including the White House, the DOJ, the DHS, and I understand from our leadership and others, that soon there will be the piece of legislation that we refer to as Davis-Oliver. In Davis-Oliver, we actually have the enforcement provisions that are nec-essary to restore the respect for the rule of law, and especially the domestic enforcement of our immigration laws. We are setting the stage for that and clearing the path for that with this rule on the legislation that will pass, I believe, under suspension. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. CHENEY. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. KING of Iowa. The provisions that are necessary that I would point out to the body, Mr. Speaker, are this: The number one most important is this: We only have 5,000 ICE agents for 50 States and territories. They are spread so thin they can’t possibly en-force immigration law. We need that number tripled. That is 10,000 ICE agents. That is the most important component of this to have the officers to bring that enforcement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5996 July 19, 2017 
Second thing is we need to make sure that the ICE detainer language is there and in Davis-Oliver. That is something that had been neutralized by an action of the Obama administration, and they need to be certain that they have the full authority to carry firearms. Mr. Speaker, I make these points so that the body can anticipate what is coming down the pike. I intend to sup-port the rule and the underlying bills, and I intend to be here on the floor ad-vocating all of the components of Davis-Oliver, also including the compo-nents I have articulated here today. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the oppor-tunity to address the House. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, the American people may be scratching their heads wondering why, with every-thing going on in the world, we are prioritizing bills that put our environ-ment at risk—bills the Senate may never take up. Let me remind them that the major-ity is just doing the bidding of an ad-ministration that has shown a com-plete disregard for air, water, and land. The administration has already pro-posed a budget that would slash the Environmental Protection Agency by 32 percent. This would harm not only conservation and climate efforts, but thousands of jobs nationwide. As a microbiologist, I know firsthand the importance of science in our legis-lative process, yet the majority has re-fused to give science and facts their rightful place in policy debates that we have. From drastically reducing funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, and by discrediting climate change, to attempting to eliminate safeguards for our genetic privacy, the majority and this administration have worked hand in hand to ruthlessly roll back the scientific advancements that we have made. It is shameful that we are here today considering bills that would silence ex-perts and risk the health and safety of our communities. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question on the rule and the bills, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am proud to be here, and I am proud of the agenda that we have taken up under the Republican leadership in this Congress. We are indeed doing the im-portant work that the people sent us here to do. So far, just a list of some of the things that we have done in the first few months of this Congress: We have taken the first step in our obligation to repeal and replace ObamaCare, a sys-tem that is absolutely failing, that is causing rising premiums. It is causing people to lose their insurance all across the Nation, a system that will collapse if we don’t fix it. We, the House Repub-licans, have taken important steps in order to begin the repeal and replace process of ObamaCare. Also, Mr. Speaker, we have passed a bill to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank, legislation that was strangling our local community banks across the country. We have taken a step to begin to fix that and provide relief. We have also dealt with important immigration issues and taken impor-tant action in terms of passing legisla-tion to end human trafficking. I am very proud, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, of the work that we have done to pass the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act to begin to rebuild our military and get the military the resources it needs so that it can defend us against a growing array of threats and a very complex array of enemies across the Nation. We have also, Mr. Speaker, taken im-portant steps using the congressional review action process to repeal regula-tions put in place over the last 8 years that have been damaging to our indus-try, to individuals, to small businesses all across the Nation. We have been historically productive, and it may be that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle don’t agree with the steps that we have taken, but it is simply not accurate to say we aren’t focusing on what is important. We are focusing on those issues that matter most to the men and women across this Nation that will begin to make sure we can keep everybody safe, begin to make sure we can defend our-selves, begin the process of reforming our outdated and burdensome tax code, as well, Mr. Speaker, as ensuring we bring back the kind of economic growth we know we need and fixing our healthcare system. These bills that we are debating today, the rule for these bills, are part of that process. I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. F
LORES , Mr. M ULLIN , and Mr. Y
OUNG , for their hard work on this legislation. In Wyoming, which is one of our Na-tion’s largest energy-producing States, we know how important it is that we work to develop our domestic energy resources. We know the technology that has been available that has helped us do that, that has helped us begin to, for the first time ever, have energy independence that has really helped us begin to have the kind of economic growth we need. We cannot depend just on that tech-nology. We also have got to improve the permitting process, Mr. Speaker. Improving the pipeline permitting process by promoting the kind of time-ly review, supporting interagency co-ordination, and creating a new and streamlined system for safety that will help us to transport our energy exports and imports are all crucial steps in our ability to ensure affordable energy and economic growth. The other bill that we are consid-ering under this rule, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 218, will provide a desperately needed road, as you heard my colleague Mr. Y
OUNG explain, to improve the safety and well-being of the residents of King Cove, Alaska, and save lives, Mr. Speaker. Therefore, I urge adoption of both the rule and the underlying bills. The material previously referred to by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 454 O FFERED BY  M
S. SLAUGHTER  At the end of the resolution, add the fol-lowing new sections: S
EC6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consider-ation of the bill (H.R. 685) to amend the In-ternal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage do-mestic insourcing and discourage foreign outsourcing. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally di-vided and controlled by the chair and rank-ing minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and re-port the bill to the House with such amend-ments as may have been adopted. The pre-vious question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without in-structions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no reso-lution on the bill, then on the next legisla-tive day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. S
EC. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 685. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT I
TREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), de-scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-mand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate

vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Repub-lican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Rep-resentatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Al-though it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member con-trolling the time will not yield for the pur-pose of offering an amendment, the same re-sult may be achieved by voting down the pre-vious question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the pre-vious question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amend-ment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon re-jection of the motion for the previous ques-tion on a resolution reported from the Com-mittee on Rules, control shifts to the Mem-ber leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for de-bate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican major-ity’s agenda and allows those with alter-native views the opportunity to offer an al-ternative plan. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the res-olution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. M
ITCHELL ). The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned.

RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of the House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. C
OL-
LINS of Georgia). The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read as follows: 
Expressing the sense of the House of Rep-resentatives that the President shall imme-diately disclose his tax return information to the House of Representatives and the American people. Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return information to the public; Whereas, the chairmen of the Committee on Ways and Means, Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Committee on Finance have the authority to request the President’s tax returns under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; Whereas, pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the Constitution, often referred to as the Origination Clause, the House of Rep-resentatives has the sole authority to ini-tiate legislation that raises revenue for the national government, and the Committee on Ways and Means is considering a comprehen-sive reform of the Tax Code; Whereas, President Donald J. Trump holds interests as the sole or principal owner in ap-proximately 500 separate business entities, and the President’s tax plan proposes to cut the corporate tax from 35 percent to 15 per-cent, applicable to many of these entities; Whereas, against the advice of ethics at-torneys and the nonpartisan Office of Gov-ernment Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses, has instead placed his assets in a trust which is run by his adult children, and the Presi-dent can withdraw profits from his trust at any time of his choosing from any of the companies he owns; Whereas, the Director of the Office of Gov-ernment Ethics, Walter Shaub, resigned on July 6, 2017, stating that ‘‘There isn’t much more I could accomplish at the Office of Gov-ernment Ethics, given the current situation. O.G.E.’s recent experiences have made it clear that the ethics program needs to be strengthened’’; Whereas, according to media reports ana-lyzing President Trump’s leaked 2005 tax re-turn, had his own tax plan been in place, he would have paid an estimated 3.48 percent rate instead of a 24 percent rate, saving him $31.3 million in that year alone; Whereas, without access to the President’s tax returns, the American people cannot de-termine how much he will personally benefit from proposed changes to the Tax Code or from policy decisions he makes, nor can the American people fully understand the finan-cial interests and motivations of the Presi-dent; Whereas, in June 2017, President Trump filed an updated financial disclosure with the Office of Government Ethics which showed that the President reported $37.2 million in-come from the Mar-a-Lago resort between January 2016 and April 2017 where he hosted the President of China and from where he or-dered missile strikes against Syria; Whereas, during the same time period, President Trump reported $288 million in in-come from all his golf courses, including $19.7 million from his course in Bedminister, New Jersey; Whereas, over the weekend of July 14, President Trump sent out eight tweets pro-moting the U.S. Women’s Open Golf Tour-nament which took place at his Bedminister club; Whereas, Mar-a-Lago doubled its new member fees to $200,000 immediately fol-lowing the 2016 election, and President Trump personally benefits from such new member fees; Whereas, disclosure of the President’s tax returns would help those investigating Rus-sian interference in the 2016 election and as-sist them in better understanding the Presi-dent’s financial ties to the Russian Federa-tion, Russian businesses, and Russian indi-viduals; Whereas, in 2013, President Trump said, ‘‘Well, I’ve done a lot of business with the Russians. They’re smart and they’re tough,’’ and President Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., told a news outlet in 2008 that ‘‘Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-sec-tion of a lot of our assets’’; Whereas, President Trump fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, who was overseeing an investigation into ties and any collusion between the Rus-sian Government and President Trump’s campaign; Whereas, former Director Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that President Trump asked him to ‘‘let go’’ of an investigation into former National Se-curity Advisor Michael Flynn’s business ties to Russia; Whereas, President Trump stated on May 11, 2017, that he had decided that he was going to fire Comey because of ‘‘this Russia thing’’; Whereas, at the G-20 Hamburg summit on July 7, 2017, President Trump took a more than 2 hour closed-door meeting with Presi-dent Vladimir Putin, after which he claimed that he ‘‘strongly pressed’’ President Putin on Russian interference in U.S. elections and that it is ‘‘time to move forward’’; Whereas, on June 9, 2016, then-Candidate Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., then- Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Trump son-in-law and current White House adviser Jared Kushner met with a per-son described as ‘‘a Russian government at-torney,’’ and a former Russian military in-telligence officer who promised to offer in-criminating information about Hillary Clin-ton which had been collected as part of a Russian Government effort to assist Presi-dent Trump in his campaign for President; Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has in the past used the authority under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in 2014 to make public the con-fidential tax information of 51 taxpayers; Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has now voted three times along party lines to continue to conceal President Trump’s tax returns; Whereas, the House of Representatives has now refused ten times to act on President Trump’s tax returns; Whereas, the Committee on the Judiciary has failed to conduct even basic oversight on the connections between the Russian Gov-ernment and the Trump campaign; Whereas, the Committee on the Judiciary has now voted twice along party lines to de-cline to request documents detailing the Trump administration’s ties with Russian of-ficials; Whereas, the House of Representatives un-dermines its dignity and the integrity of its proceedings by continuing the cover-up of President Trump’s tax returns: Now, there-fore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representa-tives shall— 1. Immediately request the tax return and return information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015, as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well as the tax return, and return information with respect to the Presi-dent’s businesses, of each business entity dis-closed by Donald J. Trump on his Office of Government Ethics Form 278e, specifically each corporation and each partnership, with-in the meaning of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, where he is listed as an officer, director, or equiva-lent, or exercises working control; and 2. Postpone consideration of tax reform legislation until the elected Representatives of the American people in this House have obtained President Trump’s tax returns and return information to ascertain how any changes to the Tax Code might financially benefit the President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5998 July 19, 2017 
presents a question of the privileges of the House? Mr. CICILLINE. Yes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman is recognized on the question of order. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this resolution raises the question of the privilege of the House pursuant to rule IX, clause 1, as it affects, ‘‘the rights of the House collectively, its dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings,’’ inso-far as it raises the House’s failure to undertake its constitutional responsi-bility of oversight and the obligation of all elected officials to ensure decisions are made free of conflicts and with the public interest in mind. In particular, matters related to the House’s constitutionally granted pow-ers have been recognized as valid ques-tions of the privileges of the House. The Origination Clause that requires that revenue bills originate in the House includes the issues related to revenues generated by our Tax Code. Clearly, the issues raised by this res-olution cover these matters con-templated by the Origination Clause. There is nothing more of a threat to the integrity of the House than ignor-ing our duty to provide a check and balance to the executive branch. To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request President Trump’s tax returns and give the American people the transparency they deserve. The stunning conflicts of interest are piling up as the President, his family, and his friends profit in their personal business endeavors while serving in public office. President Trump has not divested himself from his businesses as was recommended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman’s remarks must be confined to the question of order. Mr. CICILLINE. I understand, Mr. Speaker. My point is, in order to rule on this, it is important for the Chair to understand that the severity of the questions with respect to the integrity of our proceedings are undermined be-cause of the potential conflicts of in-terest and the lack of information about the tax returns and related ma-terials of the President. So you can’t make an argument about the rights of the House collec-tively, its dignity, and the integrity of the proceedings without understanding the presence, the evidence of the con-flicts of interest, of the potential for-eign entanglements, of the self-dealing that tax returns would reveal and help illuminate. You also can’t protect the integrity of our responsibilities as a check on the executive branch without under-standing that we have a responsibility to examine these financial inter-actions, the influence of the Russians, and interfering with our elections, the firing of Director Comey, the secret meetings between the President’s cam-paign. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman is again reminded to keep his remarks confined to the question of order. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I un-derstand the ruling of the Chair with respect to confining my remarks. These remarks, in fact, relate directly to whether or not this resolution, which seeks the production of the President’s tax returns, relate to ‘‘the rights of the House collectively, its dignity, and the integrity of the pro-ceedings.’’ What I am suggesting, Mr. Speaker, is that in order for the House to fulfill its responsibilities, its constitutional responsibilities of oversight, and check and balance on the executive branch and to faithfully honor our responsibil-ities under the Origination Clause that says the House is the place that rev-enue generation must begin—and we are contemplating a reform of the Tax Code—in order to do that, free from the potential conflicts of interest, the House and the American people have a right to know what are the real inter-ests of President Trump, where are his investments, what are the tax policies, will they benefit him, or will they ben-efit the American people. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds the gentleman to con-fine his remarks to the question of order. The Chair is prepared to rule. The gentleman from Rhode Island seeks to offer a resolution as a ques-tion of the privileges of the House under rule IX. In evaluating the resolution under rule IX, the Chair must determine whether the resolution affects ‘‘the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.’’ The first resolving clause of the reso-lution offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island seeks tax returns and tax return information of the President and certain of his business entities. Section 702 of the House Rules and Manual states that ‘‘rule IX is con-cerned not with the privileges of the Congress, as a legislative branch, but only with the privileges of the House, as a House.’’ As the Chair most recently ruled on June 21, 2017, a resolution offered under rule IX seeking information from ac-tors entirely extramural to the House—such as the President and cer-tain business entities in which the President may be involved—is not uniquely concerned with the privileges of the House, as a House. Accordingly, the resolution offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island does not constitute a question of privi-lege under rule IX. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ap-peal the ruling of the Chair. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House?

Mr. Speaker, it is my un-derstanding that the Rules Committee has posted a Rules Committee print of the Defense appropriations bill and that this committee version does not include the language added during the Defense appropriations markup on a bi-partisan basis in committee that would repeal the 2001 authorization to use force and give 8 months for Congress to do what our Constitution requires, and that is to debate and to come up with a new vote and to decide what we are going to do on behalf of our country. Further inquiry. Members don’t real-ly quite understand this. I can’t ex-plain to Members how in the heck this body can prevent this amendment from being undemocratically stripped from this bill. Can the Chair explain that, please. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-imous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks and include extra-neous material on the bill, H.R. 2910. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Michigan? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to House Resolution 454 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consider-ation of the bill, H.R. 2910. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. D
UNCAN ) to pre-side over the Committee of the Whole. b1426 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 2910) to provide for Federal and State agency coordination in the approval of certain authorizations under the Natural Gas Act, and for other purposes, with Mr. D
UNCAN of Tennessee in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U
PTON ) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. C
ASTOR ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2910, the Promoting Inter-agency Coordination for Review of Nat-ural Gas Pipelines Act, introduced by my colleague and friend from Texas (Mr. F
LORES ). I want to congratulate him for his work on this very important piece of legislation that, in fact, will stream-line the permit process for the building of energy infrastructure, which will strengthen our economy, create the jobs that we want, and, in fact, in-crease our energy security. Very im-portant. This bill is going to address the crit-ical need to expand and modernize the Nation’s natural gas pipeline infra-structure by promoting a more timely and efficient review. Mr. Chairman, by establishing FERC as the lead agency, this bill is going to bring greater certainty, account-ability, and transparency to the siting process for interstate natural gas pipe-lines. Unfortunately, many important projects have been delayed unneces-sarily while waiting for permits from participating agencies, and when siting a pipeline project, multiple permits are always required, permits under the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Spe-cies Act, the Clean Air Act. So FERC often coordinates with a va-riety of Federal, State, and local gov-ernments and Indian Tribes to balance a wide range of issues, including the potential impacts on environmental and wildlife resources, land use, and, of course, property rights. This bill is going to improve the per-mitting process by strengthening the lead agency role of FERC in further de-fining the process for participating in Federal and State agencies, and the in-tent of these provisions is to involve stakeholders sooner so that they can be involved in the setting of the sched-ule and identify issues of concern ear-lier in the process. Further, the legislation requires that agencies conduct their respective re-views concurrently and in conjunction with the project-related review con-ducted by FERC in compliance with NEPA—in compliance with NEPA. b1430 To be clear, we are not skipping steps, we are just saying that one part of the process shouldn’t hold up the en-tire project if progress can be made on other required permits. So this bill is going to encourage more timely and efficient reviews, a more robust and reliable energy pipe-line system, more affordable energy prices for every American. Mr. Chair, I congratulate the gen-tleman from Texas, who has brought this bill before us through the com-mittee process. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2910. The bill shortcuts the important review process for interstate natural gas pipeline projects, a process which already boasts one of the quickest re-view periods for any type of major en-ergy project. The bill is unnecessary. To my colleague from the Energy and Commerce Committee’s point when he says that too many of these projects are being delayed: to the contrary. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-sion testified in front of our committee

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH6002 July 19, 2017 
that almost 90 percent of interstate natural gas pipeline projects are ap-proved within 1 year. This is a dan-gerous bill because of what it does to short-circuit safety and environmental review processes. Now, I want to say, at the outset, pipelines can be a safe and practical way to transport natural gas. Natural gas pipelines are part of a modern en-ergy infrastructure system—I would say that almost all Democrats agree with that—but what this bill does is it shortcuts, it overrides safety, private property rights, environmental con-cerns. This is a problem, because when you look at the long list of serious acci-dents involving natural gas pipelines, the fatalities, the accidents, the inju-ries, it is just inappropriate and very poor public policy to give those natural gas pipelines a pass. Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. R
USH), the ranking mem-ber of the Energy and Commerce’s Sub-committee on Energy. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. C
ASTOR ), a wonderful colleague and a Member who has really shown ex-traordinary leadership on this matter and other matters that appear before this Congress and the Energy and Com-merce Committee. Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose H.R. 2910 because it is a bill that offers a solu-tion in search of a problem. As FERC testified before the Energy Subcommittee just this past May, a whopping 88 percent of natural gas pipeline applications are currently processed within a year, and the num-ber one reason for the delays in the ap-proval process was due to applicants submitting incomplete paperwork. Mr. Chair, H.R. 2910 does nothing to actually address the reason behind the delays, but instead will allow incom-plete applications to be considered, will allow incomplete data from aerial surveys to be considered, and would minimize the input of States and agen-cies responsible for protecting the en-vironment, sensitive lands, and other natural resources. However, that said, one of the most egregious aspects of this bill is that it would actually make it easier for pri-vate pipeline companies to claim emi-nent domain and seize private property of hardworking American citizens. Mr. Chair, as we have seen in the past and continue to witness today, the issue of constructing these major pipe-lines through aquifers, private prop-erty, cultural sites, and other sensitive lands is a topic that causes great pub-lic consternation and great public con-cern. Congress should be taking into ac-count the sensitive nature of this ex-tremely divisive issue by listening to our own constituents, the American people, and giving them more of a voice in these very difficult decisions, rather than trying to limit their input. Mr. Chair, to address this critical issue, both Ranking Member PALLONE , as well as my colleague, Congress-woman W
ATSON COLEMAN of New Jer-sey, and I offered amendments to deny private companies the right to claim eminent domain unless constructing a pipeline was found to be in the public interest, and not solely as a way for companies to turn a profit. Mr. Chair, even though this amend-ment was brought up and voted down by my Republican colleagues in the En-ergy and Commerce Committee, it was ruled nongermane to today’s discussion for some very odd, but also for some very obvious reason. In other words, Mr. Chair, the major-ity party has determined that although they are pushing a bill that would make it easier for private companies to seize lands from private citizens for fi-nancial gain, Members of Congress are not allowed to take up an up-or-down vote on that issue on the floor here today. This Congress is telling the American people: Hell, no, you won’t have a voice in this. We are here operating solely in the interests of private companies for their private profit. Mr. Chair, I can assure you that the American people will not agree with this decision to place the interests of private natural gas companies above the rights and interests of private land-owners. Congress should not make it easier for private companies to claim eminent domain and potentially negatively im-pact historical sites, reservoirs, farms, and other private properties while at the same time limiting the ability for States, Tribes, and local communities to provide input into the process. Mr. Chair, why are we allowing these private companies to have eminent do-main over the private property, over the land of American citizens, without any input from States on this par-ticular matter? Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I strong-ly oppose this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to oppose it as well. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, there is a reason why the parliamentarians ruled that the amendments on eminent domain are not applicable here: because they are not germane. Eminent domain is not part of this bill. In fact, the underlying natural gas act requires that eminent domain proceedings, ‘‘shall conform as nearly as may be with the practice and procedure in similar action or pro-ceedings in the courts of the State where the property is situated.’’ This doesn’t change that, and that is why those eminent domain amend-ments were not made in order. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. F
LORES ), the sponsor of the bill. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman U
PTON for yielding me time in his effort to bring this bill to the floor today. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2910. Thanks to the shale revolution, Amer-ica is a top global producer of natural gas, and in the past several years, nat-ural gas has become the top fuel choice for generating electricity in our Na-tion. My constituents in Texas have seen the dramatic benefits of the shale revo-lution and pay some of the lowest elec-tricity costs in the Nation. For exam-ple, last April, the residential price for electricity was just over 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. However, the average price in Massachusetts was almost 21 cents per kilowatt-hour. America’s domestic energy outlook has completely flipped from scarcity to abundance, yet why do some parts of the country, primarily in the north-east, pay twice as much for electricity? There is one clear reason: some areas lack the needed pipeline infrastructure to bring natural gas to consumers. The reason for this is that some State and Federal agencies are failing to make timely decisions on the nec-essary pipeline permits to deliver nat-ural gas to consumers. We can and we should modernize our pipeline infrastructure to match our abundant natural gas resources. Mak-ing the permitting process more effi-cient enables and encourages a more robust and reliable pipeline infrastruc-ture system; that way, all parts of the country can realize the benefits of clean, affordable, and abundant natural gas. My bill, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, builds on important per-mit reforms under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 by bringing greater ac-countability, predictability, and trans-parency to the process to approve interstate natural gas pipelines. This bill requires early notification to all participating agencies, States, and Indian Tribes, and it reinforces FERC’s status as the lead agency for coordination. It further establishes a clear process for consultation and concurrent re-views among Federal and State agen-cies and Indian Tribes, and sets dead-lines for final decisions. Mr. Chairman, these are common-sense reforms that reduce interagency bureaucracy, and I think that we can all agree that permitting should be more transparent and more account-able. H.R. 2910 enhances certainty for pipe-line applicants, but it is important to note that this bill does not guarantee an outcome, it does not guarantee an approval on any application, and it does not change any existing environ-mental laws. So all the rhetoric we just heard over the last few minutes about it changing the environment is abso-lutely 100 percent false. It does not change any eminent do-main laws or adversely affect private property rights. So all that argument we heard a few minutes ago is false. So

we could conclude this debate pretty quickly if the other side will acknowl-edge the fact of what this bill really does do and what it doesn’t do. It does, however, ensure that in-volved agencies do their job and that they act on appropriate projects in a timely manner. The CHAIR. The time of the gen-tleman has expired. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I yield an ad-ditional 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. FLORES. Similar provisions have passed the House as stand-alone legislation and were also included in the comprehensive energy bill that passed the House last Congress. Addi-tionally, H.R. 2910 passed out of the En-ergy and Commerce Committee on a bi-partisan vote. My bill enables more reliable infra-structure to deliver affordable, envi-ronmentally friendly natural gas to consumers. This American energy resource serves as an important energy source for hardworking families and powers our economy. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2910. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I think the point on eminent domain is the fact that this bill will trample on the rights of landowners, because my colleague is correct, current law gives natural gas pipeline companies access to Federal eminent domain authority, allowing these corporations to take private property to build their pipe-lines. But what the bill does, it would further narrow the already few oppor-tunities that landowners and stake-holders have for review of safety and important environmental protections. It also would allow surveying while circumventing local permitting and without property owner consent, and that is a very significant change, be-cause it would allow Federal and State agencies to accept aerial survey data and provides that the agencies may grant conditional approvals based on that data, and that can be unwise and unsafe. So we wanted to highlight that as a very significant concern for those Members who are concerned about emi-nent domain and private property rights. Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. W
ATSON COLEMAN ). Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chair, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague from Florida for yielding me some time to speak on what I consider to be a very important issue. Mr. Chair, I rise to strongly oppose H.R. 2910, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act. b1445 This industry-backed bill provides FERC with unnecessary authorities that put the interest of companies over that of the people and the environ-ment. The current process that FERC uses to approve pipelines is inherently flawed, genuinely threatens our green spaces, water resources, and public and private lands. By allowing this bill to pass, we are permitting FERC to exclude the input of those who would be directly im-pacted in exchange for benefiting the fossil fuel industry. We need to have a more comprehensive process that con-siders the effects these pipelines will have on local communities, which is why I introduced H.R. 2649, the Safer Pipelines Act of 2017. My legislation is about inclusiveness, ensuring that the voice of communities impacted by a proposed pipeline are heard loud and clear. I have seen this problem up close. One project before FERC is a pro-posed PennEast pipeline, which would run through my congressional district. The PennEast plan has been fraught by community concerns on issues ranging from potential contamination of drink-ing water and destruction of environ-mentally sensitive areas. Despite these issues, FERC’s final en-vironmental impact statement erro-neously concluded that the project would have minimal impact. Just last month, the New Jersey De-partment of Environmental Protection rejected the construction permits due to PennEast’s continuous refusal to provide simple environmental surveys and information requested by the State. Not only does this bill severely threaten clean water in environ-mentally sensitive areas, it also tram-ples on the rights of private property owners and communities. Jacqueline Evans of New Jersey has shared this story with us: The farm I built with my children would be completely destroyed by the 36-inch pipe built to the weakest standards allowable. The pipeline route is less than 200 feet from my children’s bedrooms, putting them in a designated ‘‘incineration zone.’’ Our well, that provides water for our fam-ily and our livestock, is threatened. PennEast has threatened me by insisting I sign a ‘‘deal’’ of less than 4 percent of the value of our home, or lose it through emi-nent domain. PennEast’s intimidation tactics include telling us that FERC will approve the pipe-line with or without surveys and environ-mental studies that are required. 
Mr. Chairman, this is unacceptable. I offered two amendments to this bill that the Rules Committee refused to allow on the floor. One would have lim-ited the use of eminent domain for gas pipeline projects, and the other would have limited the use of area remote surveys. We cannot prioritize the wishes of private pipeline companies at the ex-pense of clean drinking water, our en-vironment and natural resources, and the rights of private owners. So I stand here today begging my colleagues to vote for the people and to reject this bill by voting against it. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ten-nessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman U
PTON and Mr. F LO-
RESfor the work that they have done on this piece of legislation. Mr. F
LORES  spoke of the need to do this and why it is so important for us to begin to sim-plify and clean up the rules and the regulation process so that we do pro-vide certainty not only for our con-stituents, but also for industry. In addition to that, Mr. Chairman, what we do is to provide hope to mil-lions of workers who work in the en-ergy sector. I want to read from a letter of sup-port. This is from the International Union of Operating Engineers. They sent a letter in support of Mr. F
LORES ’ bill, and it gets right to the heart of the issue. ‘‘Domestic energy production pro-vides good-paying jobs for members of the IUOE and other construction craftworkers and continues to employ thousands of our members. Uncer-tainty and delay during environmental reviews, however, hinder the growth of jobs related to the Nation’s energy in-frastructure. Congress should give FERC additional tools to keep Federal agencies accountable and maximum co-ordination in the permitting process.’’ Mr. Chairman, this is from individ-uals who work in this energy sector, who understand the vital importance of having a secure, safe, and stable energy supply. They are individuals who want to see growth in this industry. They also want to make certain that we do this in the appropriate way—as we have done, as H.R. 2910 does—to respect individual and private property works. The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-woman has expired. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentle-woman. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Giving FERC the authority that they need to go in and consolidate and simplify this environ-mental process for these interstate gas projects is the right thing to do. Many times, what slows these projects down and causes the situation that the International Union of Oper-ating Engineers speaks to is the fact that you have multiple permits that are required, and they are from mul-tiple agencies and multiple levels of government. Any time you are going through that, there are more opportu-nities for mistakes and it is going to be more costly. So I congratulate my colleague for a job well done, and I encourage my col-leagues to vote for and support H.R. 2910. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-man, I want to make it clear: I heard the comments of my colleague from Tennessee, and the Democrats do sup-port natural gas pipelines, a very im-portant part of our energy infrastruc-ture. And, as a reminder, the Federal En-ergy Regulatory Commission approves

almost 90 percent of all pipeline appli-cations within 1 year. And if there is any holdup recently, it is because the Republican-led Senate has not con-firmed an additional FERC appointee. That is holding up the process of ap-proving more natural gas pipelines. What we don’t approve of, however, is a spill that attempts to short-circuit very important safety and environ-mental review processes and take pri-vate property rights away from land-owners. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. T
ONKO ). Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2910, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act. This bill is a solution in search of a problem. We heard from FERC that 88 percent of projects are certified within 1 year following a completed application. It is clear that, under the existing process, these projects are moving forward without significant delays. We have not seen good evidence that we need to further tilt the process in favor of pipeline companies, which is what the bill before us today would do. While I am concerned about a num-ber of provisions in this bill, I specifi-cally want to highlight the section that would require Federal and State agencies to accept aerial survey data, such as data collected by drones, and allow these agencies to grant condi-tional approvals based on that data. Aerial data have limitations and can be insufficient. These data may not ac-count for historic sites, endangered species, or wetlands. But, under this bill, agencies would be required to con-sider the project. Granting conditional permits based on inadequate data will ultimately not speed up the process, but what it does instead is circumvent the rights of landowners. We also should be more thoughtful about changing this process, given the implications that will impact private landowners’ rights. Under the law, pipeline companies are able to use eminent domain author-ity, allowing these corporations to take private property to build their pipelines. This bill would further re-strict the already limited opportunities that private landowners and concerned citizens have to weigh in on proposed projects. Streamlining is fine, but we are con-sidering expediting a process that can result in the use of eminent domain. The bar for seizing private property should be high, and lowering that bar is to the detriment of private land-owners. Historically, when considering the use of eminent domain, the question has been: Is it in the public’s interest? But this bill is forcing the question to shift to: Is it in the company’s inter-est? That is not acceptable to me, and it certainly isn’t acceptable to the gen-eral public. If we continue to expedite and rubber stamp these projects, consumers will be on the hook for unviable and, even-tually, stranded assets. We need to look at our energy infra-structure based on holistic, regional needs that take into account how many projects are under consideration and how it would impact existing infra-structure. Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-zona (Mr. G
OSAR ). Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2910, legislation sponsored by my friend and Western Caucus member, B
ILLFLORES . One area of wide bipartisan agree-ment is the need to support critical in-frastructure in the United States. This bill presents an important opportunity to deliver on our commitment to mod-ernize infrastructure, grow the econ-omy, and support safe, reliable Amer-ican-made energy. By improving agency and industry coordination, we can provide more cer-tainty regarding the timeframe and procedures of the pipeline review proc-ess. By making these improvements, we will ensure that the energy we produce right here in America can be transported in the safest possible man-ner. If my colleagues are truly serious about protecting the environment, we should be promoting American-made energy, where we know it will be pro-duced in adherence to the highest envi-ronmental and safety standards. This bill does exactly that by making the improvements necessary to mod-ernize our pipeline approval process. These improvements are necessary to match the advancements in shale gas technology and increased demand for safe, reliable, and domestically-sourced energy. While roads and bridges often get the most attention when we talk about the need for updated infrastructure, mod-ern pipelines and other energy infra-structure are sorely needed to support our economy and power our homes and businesses. Promoting efficient and comprehen-sive cooperation within our regulatory process is an effort that is not only bi-partisan, but plain common sense. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas for sponsoring this much- needed legislation, and I urge my col-leagues to vote in support of this com-monsense bill. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, when we had a hear-ing earlier in the year in the Energy and Commerce Committee, I assumed there was a major backlog of unreviewed applications that spurred my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to draft this bill. But then we heard from experts from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission about this, and they testified that nearly 90 percent of these major infrastructure projects are approved in less than a year. Many companies working to have other interstate energy projects ap-proved can only dream of a Federal re-view occurring in less than a year. So this is already a very efficient process. I would say this bill is unnecessary, it is duplicative, and it is wasteful. And I know many in the Congress here are looking for ways to eliminate govern-ment waste and duplication. The Congress has already taken ac-tion to streamline the Federal environ-mental permitting review process for major infrastructure projects. Some-times our memories are short, but it was just last Congress where Congress adopted the major Transportation and Infrastructure bill, the FAST Act. It passed in a bipartisan manner and was signed into law. The FAST Act authorized the Fed-eral Permitting Improvement Steering Council, or FPISC, to improve the timeliness, predictability, and trans-parency of Federal environmental re-view processes for these major infra-structure projects. Now, FPISC is already getting under-way. It has set up this enhanced co-ordination and transparency by estab-lishing a lead agency for the project, recommends performance schedules, and public project timetables. Many of the provisions in this bill, however, seem to be largely duplicative of the activities of FPISC and what they are already doing. FPISC is already overseeing and co-ordinating permitting processes for 32 major infrastructure projects, includ-ing seven interstate natural gas pipe-lines—just to highlight that this is an unnecessary power grab that really is short-circuiting very important safety and environmental review processes. b1500 There is no problem across this coun-try right now with getting your nat-ural gas pipeline approved unless there is a real problem in the details of the application. Now, I used to practice environ-mental law in a previous lifetime, and what I learned is, when you provide for these short-circuited processes that keep the public out, that keep other stakeholders out, what you are going to do on the back end, you are going to cause more lawsuits, more delays, rather than just adhering to the proper process, answering questions as you go along, pressing ahead, altering the route when it needs to be rerouted. So this is a very important issue. The details really matter here. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. I include in the R

EARSPEAKER RYAN: On behalf of the Na-tional Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), I am writing in strong support of H.R. 2883, Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act which would establish a more uniform and transparent approval proc-ess for the construction, connection, oper-ation, or maintenance of oil or natural gas pipelines or electric transmission facilities for the import or export of oil, natural gas, or electricity. NECA also supports H.R. 2910, Promoting Interagency Coordination for Re-view of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, which would help address the need to modernize the nation’s natural gas pipeline infrastructure by promoting more timely and efficient re-views by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). NECA believes these critical pieces of legislation will facilitate construction projects along the United States’ borders and encourage energy inde-pendence. NECA is the nationally recognized voice of the $130 billion electrical construction indus-try that brings power, light, and communica-tion technology to buildings and commu-nities across the U.S. NECA’s national office and its 119 local chapters are dedicated to en-hancing the industry through continuing education, labor relations, safety codes, standards development, and government re-lations. NECA is committed to advocating for a comprehensive energy policy that ad-dresses all available opportunities for energy exploration and independence. By establishing a more concrete process for the approval of construction projects to import oil, natural gas, and electricity, this legislation would create more jobs in the construction industry while working towards America’s energy independence. Construc-tion along the U.S. border to import oil, nat-ural gas, and electricity will greatly enhance our nation’s energy security and promote en-ergy independence. It is clear Congress plays a critical role in streamlining the approval process and enacting policies that support approval and construction of energy infra-structure projects. The benefits of these projects are clear: job creation, energy secu-rity, energy independence, and economic growth; such construction is in the national interest. NECA strongly endorses H.R. 2883 and H.R. 2910 and believes that these bills will deliver many benefits to our nation. Sincerely, M

NATIONAL TAYPAYERS UNION, Washington, DC, July 18, 2017. 
NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION VOTE ALERT  NTU urges all Representatives to vote ‘‘YES’’ on the following bills that would re-duce regulatory burdens and promote eco-nomic growth. H.R. 806, ‘‘Ozone Standards Implementa-tion Act of 2017’’: This legislation would ex-tend the timeframe for compliance with the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards and put in place process reforms going forward. The bungled 2008/2015 revisions have created an implementation headache for many states, now tasked with simultaneously working to enact dual standards. The costs are high for states and localities—regardless of whether they achieve attainment. Nonattainment means lost funds for highways and other es-sential infrastructure projects. On the other hand, reaching attainment could require limits on new construction and manufac-turing production, expensive retrofitting, and oppressive new rules. Either way, jobs and investment will go elsewhere without the more feasible, predictable reforms in H.R. 806. H.R. 2883, ‘‘Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act’’: This legislation would streamline the archaic cross-border permit-ting process for energy facilities that stretch across the borders we share with Mexico and Canada. The current Presidential Permit re-gime is far from clear and can leave projects in regulatory limbo for years on end. Cre-ating a consolidated and standardized ap-proval process would increase the Congres-sional accountability provided for in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, granting Congress the authority to ‘‘regulate Com-merce with foreign Nations,’’ while elimi-nating costly regulatory hurdles that stand between consumers and low-cost energy op-tions. H.R. 2910, ‘‘Promoting Interagency Coordi-nation for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act’’: This legislation would facilitate the timely review of natural gas pipeline permit-ting by clearly designating the Federal En-ergy Regulatory Commission as the lead agency responsible for interstate natural gas pipeline site permitting. This, along with other measures to increase efficiency such as providing for concurrent reviews and com-monsense timetables, would help avoid du-plication and other unnecessary delays. In addition, H.R. 2910 would increase trans-parency in the permitting process through more public disclosure, as well as create new opportunities for public input. In general, markets crave certainty in order to anticipate where resources should be allocated. This is doubly true for the giant infrastructure and manufacturing projects these bills address. Planning, per-sonnel, and capital all depend on a trans-parent, predictable, consistent regulatory process. Together, these reforms would re-sult in increased investment in our energy infrastructure, spurring job-growth in an es-sential and lucrative sector of our economy, and enhancing low-cost energy options for consumers. Roll call votes on H.R. 806, H.R. 2883, and H.R. 2910 will be included in our annual Rat-ing of Congress and a ‘‘YES’’ vote will be considered the pro-taxpayer position.

OFMANUFACTURERS , July 19, 2017. D
EARREPRESENTATIVES : The National As-sociation of Manufacturers (NAM), the larg-est manufacturing association in the United States representing manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to support H.R. 2910, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Nat-ural Gas Pipelines Act, introduced by Rep. Bill Flores (R–TX). Domestic natural gas has transformed the U.S. economy, made our companies more competitive, created jobs and put money back in the pockets of working Americans. Manufacturers use natural gas as a fuel for direct process uses, such as drying, melting, process cooling, machine drive and refrigera-tion; as a fuel for direct non-process uses in manufacturing establishments, such as heat-ing, ventilation, HVAC and lighting; as a fuel for indirect purposes, such as boilers used to produce electricity and steam; and as a feedstock in refining, chemicals and pri-mary metals sectors. Over the next decade, total demand for natural gas is projected to increase by 40 percent. Domestic manufac-turing is poised to be a key driver of this growth. Consequently, major investments in new pipeline infrastructure are required to ensure manufacturers have a steady, reliable stream of natural gas. Unfortunately, permitting these infra-structure projects remains a lengthy process. Permitting should follow a comprehensive process that ensures timely and predictable decision-making, but federal and state per-mitting agencies can create roadblocks and delays when coordination is inadequate. Strengthening the Federal Energy Regu-latory Commission’s (FERC’s) coordination of interagency processes is critical to the permitting of natural gas infrastructure and ensuring manufacturers have access to this affordable resource. H.R. 2910 would reinforce FERC’s role as the lead agency for siting interstate natural gas pipelines by directing FERC to identify and invite all agencies considering an aspect of an application to establish a schedule for concurrent reviews, and to impose deadlines for final decisions. H.R. 2910 would ensure projects undergo a robust agency review while completing that review in a timely and predictable manner. The NAM’s Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that votes on H.R. 2910, includ-ing procedural motions, may be considered for designation as Key Manufacturing Votes in the 115th Congress. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, ARICNEWHOUSE , Senior Vice President, Policy and Government Relations. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, might I inquire if the gentlewoman has any further speakers. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-man, I have one additional speaker and some submissions for the R
ECORD . Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I have no more speakers at this point, so I re-serve the balance of my time. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I include in the R
ECORD some infor-mation on pipeline incidents from the U.S. Government, just to highlight the fact that it is vitally important that these pipelines undergo safety and en-vironmental reviews. These are the pipeline incident reports from 1997–2016 for all States. I will just read a few of these statistics here. In 2016, you had 16 fatalities from natural gas pipeline incidents, 83 inju-ries, total cost of property damage, over $300 million. In 2015, 10 fatalities, 49 injuries, over 328 incidents. There is a 3-year average from 2014–2016 of 312 incidents. The 5-year average across the country is 299 incidents; 10-year av-erage, 286 incidents. For fatalities, the 3-year average, 15 fatalities; the 5-year average, 13; the 10-year average, 13; the 20-year aver-age, 16. And for injuries, the 3-year average, 75 injuries; the 5-year average, 64 inju-ries; the 10-year average, 64 injuries; the 20-year average, 65 injuries. And the property damage report, just the 3- year average is about $315 million.

Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-man, I would just say that it is inap-propriate to short-circuit the very im-portant safety and environmental re-view processes for our interstate nat-ural gas pipelines. This is a solution in search of a problem. We know that FERC approves these gas pipeline applications at about 90 percent. The only reason a little delay has fallen off recently is because the Senate has not approved the new FERC appointee over a matter of 5 months. If they would do that, I think they could get back on track as well. The ones that are not approved are undergoing very significant review. Even in the case for the major projects now, we have a new system, a coordi-nated effort through the FPISC, the new council that is overseeing inter-state natural gas pipeline, so it is du-plicative as well. It is inappropriate for a process that already grants eminent domain rights through pipeline companies to go through private property now to short- circuit the environmental and safety reviews. That is just really going too far for corporations and their profits, where landowners and other stake-holders have to have the ability to weigh in. Otherwise, you are going to cause more lawsuits and more delays at the very end of the process and, I think, do exactly the opposite of what the author of the legislation intends to do. So at this point, based upon all of the evidence that has been presented, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Don’t elevate corporate prof-its over the interests of the public. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would urge my colleagues to sup-port this legislation. Again, this streamlines the process. There are still no shortcuts that are here. We require that the agencies work concurrently with each other. At the end of the day, we know that pipelines are literally the safest way to transport whatever it is, oil, gas, to the consumers, and at a lower cost. It is safer and, obviously, helps the most vulnerable with lower costs. We have literally millions of miles of pipelines. And I would note that we passed major, major bipartisan legisla-tion in several Congresses—it was bi-partisan, it was overwhelmingly bipar-tisan—that President Obama signed into law increasing the safety stand-ards and fines for any new pipelines that are built. Those laws, obviously, stay on the books. Again, I would urge my colleagues to vote for the bill. I look forward to the debate on a couple of the amendments. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. All time for general de-bate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5- minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amend-ment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a sub-stitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–28. That amend-ment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the na-ture of a substitute is as follows:

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MS . TSONGAS  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 1 printed in part A of House Report 115–235. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: Page 12, after line 9, add the following: (h) L
IMITATION ON APPLICATION .—This sec- tion shall not apply to any application for an authorization under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act or a certificate of public conven-ience and necessity under section 7 of such Act with respect to which any part of a pipe-line facility that is a subject of the applica-tion is to be located on lands required under Federal, State, or local law to be managed for purposes of natural resource conservation or recreation. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 454, the gentlewoman from Mas-sachusetts (Ms. T
SONGAS ) and a Mem-ber opposed each will control 5 min-utes. The Chair recognizes the gentle-woman from Massachusetts. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment protects a robust public re-view process for any proposed pipeline that seeks to cross protected conserva-tion and recreation lands. The legisla-tion before us today, with its short- circuited environmental reviews, puts treasured public lands at risk. My home State of Massachusetts, like many areas around the country, faces real energy challenges. We need careful and strategic long-term plan-ning in order to lower energy prices and maintain reliability and resiliency. Over the past several years, we have seen proposals for new natural gas pipelines that would stretch hundreds of miles and cross many different com-munities. We must work to identify ways to lower energy prices for our homes and businesses, and increasing the supply of lower cost natural gas may be one way to achieve that objective while we transition to cleaner, more affordable, and sustainable alternatives. However, we cannot, in the long run, afford to be careless about our other environmental interests as we make that transition. These major infrastructure proposals in New England and elsewhere around the country deserve close and careful scrutiny given the potential environ-mental impacts and the costs borne by ratepayers. Regrettably, this legislation moves us in the wrong direction. This bill would force FERC to rush decision-making, including environmental re-views necessary to determine if pipe-lines will have negative impacts on State forests, parks, wildlife manage-ment areas, and wetlands, lands ex-pressly put aside as a result of a public decision to protect them. Our Nation has a longstanding his-tory of preserving natural habitats and protecting open spaces for the public benefit, and we have invested enormous public resources toward these goals. These lands and the decisions behind them deserve to be honored. In my district, we recently went through the public review process for a

proposed natural gas pipeline. Hun-dreds of my constituents expressed their concerns about the project. Con-struction of the pipeline could have jeopardized local wildlife and impacted both State and federally designated conservation land, as well as Massa-chusetts’ scarce farmland. Thanks to a robust review process, the public had numerous opportunities to question the project and express these legitimate concerns, and their views were able to be fully considered. While I believe we must protect that review process for all infrastructure projects, my amendment focuses on pipelines that cross protected con-servation and recreation lands. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and protect investments by Federal taxpayers, States, and local communities in preserving their nat-ural and historic resources. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I would just note that all current reviews that we do now for pipeline siting, they all remain in place. None of it goes away. Those same reviews take place. The gentlewoman’s amendment, in our view, is unnecessary because noth-ing in this legislation would limit envi-ronmental protections or affect laws that govern the multiple use of our public lands. Pipelines, we know, as I said earlier, are the safest, most efficient way to transport energy supplies. The over-whelming majority of Americans strongly support modernizing our in-frastructure, including pipelines, to en-sure stable, affordable supplies. And I would note, we have millions of miles of pipelines across the country. So what is the alternative if you don’t have a pipeline? Well, it is going to be more expensive and, frankly, the accident record is not perfect either. It includes rail or truck, often at a higher cost, which then is passed along to those consumers, im-pacting the most vulnerable the most. Infrastructure modernization and job growth go hand in hand with environ-mental and natural resource protec-tion. Investing in our infrastructure is a smart investment for energy secu-rity, job growth, manufacturing, and creating the jobs that we want. Maintaining and expanding these economywide benefits is dependent on a transparent and a predictable regu-latory approval of infrastructure projects. That is what the underlying bill does. This amendment, however, we would view as a step backward. I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amend-ment. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say, first, that energy in-frastructure is critical to our economy; yet we cannot simply give the fossil fuel industry carte blanche to build pipelines without robust public re-views. I yield 1
3⁄4minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. B
EYER ). Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to co-lead this amendment with my colleagues, Ms. T
SONGAS and Mr. M
CGOVERN . FERC, as it is currently structured, is not adequately protecting our most valued public lands designed for recre-ation and conservation, and this bill will only make this particular mis-management worse. We are witnessing this firsthand in my Virginia. At stake is one of our Nation’s treas-ured landscapes, the Appalachian Na-tional Scenic Trail, the A.T., and the surrounding national parkland and na-tional forestlands. The A.T. was con-gressionally dedicated as a national scenic trail nearly 50 years ago, and it is one of the most significant land fea-tures in the Eastern United States. It is famous around the world. Its cultural heritage, its recreational options, its natural resources all serve crucial roles in the lives and commu-nities of the Appalachian region, but it is at risk. The proposed Mountain Valley Pipe-line route impacts 19 prominent views over nearly 100 miles of the Appa-lachian Trail. Tinker Cliffs, the Drag-on’s Tooth, even the totally iconic McAfee Knob all will be corrupted by this pipeline. I am not anti-pipeline. I am not anti- energy. I am an avid Appalachian Trail hiker. I have crossed almost all of the 60 pipeline crossings that exist on the trail. But the Mountain Valley’s pro-posal route doesn’t take the least impactful route. It doesn’t cross the trail. It runs alongside it for almost 100 miles. b1515 You will be able to see the impact day after day after day. It doesn’t sound like the developers thought about minimizing their impact on this important cultural icon. It has also become clear that the pro-posed route would require an amend-ment to the Jefferson National Forest management plan, which was carefully constructed and well balanced. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and protect one of America’s most treasured nat-ural places. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I again remind my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The CHAIR.

SEC. 3. PIPELINE SECURITY. 
In considering an application for an au-thorization under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act or a certificate of public conven-ience and necessity under section 7 of such Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-mission shall consult with the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administra-tion regarding the applicant’s compliance with security guidance and best practice rec-ommendations of the Administration regard-ing pipeline infrastructure security, pipeline cybersecurity, pipeline personnel security, and other pipeline security measures. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 454, the gentleman from Massa-chusetts (Mr. L

PTON and Ms. C
ASTOR , the ranking member from Florida, for their articulate debate this afternoon on this important issue. I would also like to thank Chairman S
ESSIONS , Ranking Member S LAUGH -
TER, and all of the members of the Rules Committee for making this amendment in order. This commonsense amendment will simply ensure that the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal agency with the primary jurisdiction over pipeline security on behalf of the American people, will retain a mean-ingful seat at the table when it comes to determinations made by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, on whether to approve a pipeline con-struction permit. In particular, this amendment pro-vides that, in considering a pipeline permit application, FERC must simply consult with TSA administrators as to whether a pipeline developer is compli-ant with existing TSA guidelines and best practice recommendations gov-erning pipeline security. That includes an examination of facility security, cy-bersecurity, and other critical meas-ures that are designed to safeguard the American people against the threat of terrorists and cyber attacks per-petrated on the U.S. pipeline system. While H.R. 2910 seeks to expedite the FERC review process for pipeline con-struction projects in the name of effi-ciency, we also know that recent ter-rorist and cyber attacks launched against pipeline facilities nationwide

have more than demonstrated that we cannot place expediency above na-tional security and public safety. In 2015, a domestic terrorist received a maximum 20-year sentence after pleading guilty to Federal charges re-lating to his use of a highly volatile ex-plosive device to damage a natural pipeline in Texas. Four years earlier than that, a similar attack was per-petrated in Oklahoma by an individual armed with a homemade improvised explosive device. In addition, the 2017 series on ‘‘Pipe-lines in Peril,’’ published by Energy and Environment News, reported that advanced cyber threats targeting U.S. pipelines have only increased and evolved over the past 5 years, following a so-called pipeline hacking spree un-dertaken by members of the Chinese military. The theft of sensitive data from at least 23 separate U.S. pipeline companies in 2011 and 2012 constitute the sort of cyber breach that the Con-gressional Research Service has de-scribed as allowing hackers the ability to ‘‘disrupt pipeline service and cause spills, explosions, and fires all from re-mote locations.’’ I would also like to express my con-cern regarding an issue that was the subject of an amendment of mine which was not ruled in order, and that is the issuance of pipeline construction permits by FERC in areas where a project site and its surrounding com-munity is already experiencing pre-existing unsafe levels of air pollutants. In my own congressional district in Massachusetts, FERC recently ap-proved a proposal for a natural gas compressor station in the beautiful town of Weymouth, Massachusetts, and as evidenced by the certificate of inde-pendent and quality testing conducted by Dr. Curt Nordgaard and other com-munity stakeholders, the air quality in Weymouth is already at toxic levels of so-called criteria air pollutants such as benzene. My amendment would have sus-pended the certificate issued by FERC for the Weymouth compressor station and other projects that the commission approves for construction and commu-nities that have unsafe air quality lev-els. In addition to my concerns around air quality, I have to highlight the pub-lic safety issues surrounding the route of a natural gas pipeline that FERC ap-proved in West Roxbury, a local neigh-borhood in the heart of my district. The pipeline runs through a densely populated neighborhood. It runs right through an active blasting area in a quarry that is located next to a resi-dential area, and I don’t know how that happens if public safety and national security are considerations. Whether a pipeline is blown up be-cause of stupidity because FERC has located it in a blasting zone or it is be-cause of a nefarious attempt of outside actors, the bottom line is that FERC should sit down and talk with TSA when they are looking at these siting decisions. The bottom line is, what this amendment will accomplish, it will re-quire that to happen, that consultation to happen between TSA and FERC. Mr. Chair, I ask Members to vote in support of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amend-ment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to start out by saying that we are prepared to accept the amendment. I know that all of us here take pipeline safety very seriously, and certainly since my chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee, we put safe-ty at the forefront of our efforts to modernize our pipeline infrastructure. We passed two major bills that Presi-dent Obama signed, and I think there may have been maybe a single Member that opposed that legislation over the years, but we care a lot about that. In the last Congress, we passed the PIPES Act and the FAST Act. Again, major bipartisan initiatives that Mr. P
ALLONE and I worked out that got to President Obama’s desk. Each of these two bills took important steps to up-date our laws to protect against emerg-ing physical attacks as well as cyber attacks, threats to the grid, in our en-ergy delivery systems, including pipe-lines. We know that multiple Federal and State agencies have a role to play and an opportunity to lead with that exper-tise. While the Department of Energy is the lead sector-specific agency for cybersecurity and for the energy sec-tor, the Pipeline and Hazardous Mate-rials Safety Administration, PHMSA, is responsible for administrating min-imum pipeline safety standards, and the TSA, the Transportation Security Administration, does monitor threats to our transportation sector. I think that is where the gentleman from Mas-sachusetts is coming from with this amendment. The amendment, I have got to say, appears to be consistent with current law, while a rigid consultation require-ment could end up resulting in delays if the TSA is not able to consult in a timely manner, but, again, the lan-guage is ‘‘consult.’’ I would hope that that would happen. The amendment also appears to ad-dress pipeline facilities, but it is not clear whether it includes LNG as an ex-ample. Given the overlapping nature of Federal and State jurisdiction over pipeline safety, we want to make sure that we are doing it right and that we have got all the tools in the toolbox to make sure that that happens and we don’t wonder what would have hap-pened without this amendment. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentle-man’s amendment. We are ready to work with him, but certainly, at this point, ready to accept the amendment. Mr. LYNCH. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. UPTON. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chair, first of all, I thank the gentleman very much for ac-cepting the amendment. I agree, there may be some other areas that are not particularly addressed, such as the LNG situation. Obviously, we want to increase the level of safety with re-spect to LNG as well, but I understand those questions can be answered during our debate with the Senate as well and in conference. But the bottom line is I thank him for accepting the amendment. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, it is my understanding, I be-lieve, that a GAO report has been re-quested by some of our friends on both sides of the aisle, and we welcome the completion of that report and are anx-ious to see the result. Mr. Chairman, again, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH ). The amendment was agreed to.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH6010 July 19, 2017 
This amendment would require FERC to issue a supplemental environmental impact statement if there is critical new information relevant to a pipeline proposal, and to require mitigation plans for adverse impacts if not already provided. The case of the Mountain Valley Pipeline demonstrated how the current FERC process has failed us and why this amendment is necessary. I recently wrote a letter to FERC on this very issue, asking that they ini-tiate a supplemental environmental impact statement before moving for-ward with the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. Quite simply, the process was flawed. In response to a September 2016 draft environmental impact statement, Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC, had to present more information and an up-dated route for the pipeline proposal to FERC. Originally, Mr. Chairman, they offered 1,000 pages of updates for public comment, but then their updates ex-tended beyond the public comment pe-riod, which ended in December 2016, and included thousands of additional pages of crucially important informa-tion—20,000 pages of crucially impor-tant information. Think about how long it would take to read 20,000 pages. What is most egregious is that, be-cause this document dump came after the public comment period had ended, affected stakeholders weren’t able to offer their comments for FERC consid-eration. They had already closed the public comment period, but the pipe-line company was still submitting thousands of pages. Even more ridiculous, the developers have continued to add more docu-ments, even after FERC issued the final environmental impact statement. So apparently it wasn’t final in the eyes of the developers. For many, FERC’s recent decision to issue this final statement for the pro-posed Mountain Valley Pipeline is pat-ently alarming. The appropriate course would be to issue a supplemental environmental impact statement and allow for public comment on those 20,000 pages. Let’s fix this woefully incompetent process. Local communities affected most by proposed energy infrastructure projects naturally have concerns regarding the projects near them. On my extensive visits to southwest Virginia last summer, there were two kinds of signs everywhere, Mr. Chair-man. There were ‘‘Make America Great Again, Donald Trump for President,’’ and there were ‘‘No Mountain Valley Pipeline.’’ They deserve the opportunity to ex-press their views fully and to partici-pate in a robust public engagement process, especially for projects which will use eminent domain to seize their private land from homeowners and farmers. If there are major changes offered after the public comment period is open, let’s make sure the public has the ability to weigh in with their pro-posals. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amend-ment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, FERC is the lead agency for siting interstate natural gas pipelines. We all know that. But there are a number of other Federal and State agencies that also have to issue associated permits for large-scale projects. b1530 Through the FERC prefile process, sponsors engage with landowners, local communities, and government agencies to educate stakeholders and collect the information about the best location for siting that pipeline. The underlying bill, H.R. 2910, brings much-needed certainty and trans-parency to the process by encouraging the stakeholders to participate in good faith early in the process. Unfortu-nately, this amendment, the way that we read it, would create more uncer-tainty and create more opportunities for delays. The overwhelming majority of Amer-icans strongly support expanding the infrastructure. Creating the jobs, the pipelines, ensures stable and affordable supplies. Flexibility, affordable, and re-liable energy is important for Amer-ican families and businesses to thrive. I would note, at this point we still don’t have a quorum with FERC, and we want that to change. That will be an issue that goes through the con-firmation process in the Senate, but consumers really only benefit from do-mestic energy if we can get it to them. Investing in infrastructure is a smart investment, so I would urge my col-leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amend-ment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I very much agree with the lead spon-sor of the bill, Mr. U
PTON , that we don’t want any more uncertainty, and we certainly don’t want more delays. In fact, this amendment was origi-nally in a bipartisan bill sponsored by my Republican friend from Virginia, M
ORGAN GRIFFITH . I literally lifted it word for word. What we want to do is make sure that all of the information is on the table at the beginning. It is just not fair to the people who are affected by a pipeline that an environmental impact statement is issued and they wouldn’t have a chance to comment on it. So let’s make sure that the devel-opers are putting all of the information out first. And if they put it out and the public comment period closes and then they give you the rest of the informa-tion, then, clearly, FERC has made the decision without all that, and the pub-lic has been cheated out of the ability to comment on what is going to happen to their land and to their homes. It is just not fair. Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this good, bipartisan amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia will be postponed. Mr. UPTON.

The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U
PTON ), and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. C
ASTOR ), each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act. This legislation continues the great tradition of bipartisan legislation com-ing out of the House Energy and Com-merce Committee. Our focus has been and will continue to be building Amer-ica’s infrastructure, creating jobs, and strengthening our economy. I want to congratulate my colleagues and sponsors of this bill, particularly Mr. M
ULLIN and Mr. G ENEGREEN , Re-publican and Democrat, for their work on this legislation. H.R. 2883 would establish coordinated procedures to authorize the construc-tion, connection, operation, and main-tenance of international border-cross-ing facilities for the import and export of oil and natural gas, and the trans-mission of electricity. That is what the bill does. The legislation would replace the re-quirements established under executive order that persons obtain a Presi-dential permit before constructing an oil and gas pipeline or electric trans-mission facility that crosses the border between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. To date, Congress has not asserted its authority to establish proceedings for permitting cross-border energy infra-structure. In the absence of a statu-torily directed process, agencies have made decisions regarding cross-border energy infrastructure within the con-text of their interpretation of a series of executive orders dating back to the 1950s. Recent proposals, most notably the Keystone XL pipeline, have faced sig-nificant and unnecessary delays as a result of political interference in what should have been a straightforward re-view. There is bipartisan agreement that we should have a free flow of en-ergy in North America. This bill is going to level the playing field for energy infrastructure projects located at the international border. The legislation takes important steps to bring fairness to the process and provide certainty to countries whom we already have a free trade agreement with and businesses that want to cre-ate jobs in the U.S. It is going to strengthen our effort to improve and update NAFTA and enhance our tri-lateral trading relationships. It is time Congress exercised its con-stitutional authority to regulate com-merce with foreign nations and replace the Presidential permit requirement with a more transparent, efficient, and effective review process. Establishing the cross-border permit-ting process in law would lead to more objective and timely decisions, which, in turn, is going to create the jobs, strengthen our Nation’s energy secu-rity, and support affordable and reli-able energy for all Americans. Again, I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts on this important leg-islation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infra-structure Act. My Republican col-leagues argue that we need more bills like H.R. 2883 to extract and transport more oil and gas as quickly as possible. But building a modern energy infra-structure for the 21st century requires a lot more than drilling wells, laying more pipelines, filling more railcars with crude oil, and putting more tank-er trucks on our highways. A modern, American, 21st century energy infrastructure plan must ad-dress the threat of climate change. This is the biggest energy challenge that we face as a country. We cannot have a meaningful conversation about America’s energy infrastructure with-out also having a conversation about the changing climate and the huge costs heaped on hardworking American families and businesses because of the change in climate. I am proud to represent the State of Florida, but here is what my neighbors are experiencing now: higher AC bills, more extreme weather events, heat waves, higher cost for flood insurance and property insurance, and property taxes that are having to go now to re-pair our water and wastewater infra-structure on the coast. We have a rapidly diminishing win-dow to act to reduce our carbon pollu-tion before the catastrophic impacts of climate change are irreversible. The energy infrastructure decisions that we make today will have a real impact on whether we can mitigate climate change in the future. We need to under-stand this risk before we lock in infra-structure that will produce carbon pol-lution for decades to come. This bill’s supporters don’t like to be reminded of the daunting challenges of the changing climate. That is reflected in our discussion today, and, frankly, it is reflected in the glaring inaction of this Republican Congress to address climate change. If enacted into law, H.R. 2883 would move us backwards in our fight for the clean energy economy and the jobs of the future. H.R. 2883 would rubber- stamp permits for pipelines to carry oil, natural gas, even tar sands crude into the United States. Tar sands crude is the dirtiest fuel on the planet from a climate perspective, and this bill creates a permitting proc-ess for cross-border pipelines that make it difficult, if not impossible, for the Federal Government to say no to any of these projects. This bill asserts that every cross-bor-der energy project is always in the pub-lic interest. It is up to a project’s oppo-nent to try to prove otherwise. The bill even allows the oil industry to make major modifications to its pipelines without getting any approval at all. That means, if a company wants to in-crease its pipeline capacity or reverse an existing pipeline to carry more oil, natural gas, or tar sands crude into the United States, the company can do just that, no questions asked. Building new pipelines or expanding existing ones could have a profound en-vironmental impact, but the bill allows for no meaningful environmental re-view for a cross-border pipeline. The bill says the Federal Government can only examine the cross-border segment of the project. Who thought that up? That is very creative. It is almost hard to believe that this is what the bill does, but it is true. For a pipeline spanning hundreds of miles, the environmental review will focus on only that tiny part that crosses the U.S. border. That is irresponsible. That would eliminate the possibility of any meaningful examination of the carbon pollution impacts of these pipelines. We should be examining the carbon impact of every pipeline before we ap-prove it. Many are very important. But to do so without important environ-mental reviews in this day and age is frightening. The future will belong to the country that builds an energy infrastructure to support a cleaner, lower carbon econ-omy, and it is our responsibility to lead the country in the clean energy future with all of the jobs, consumer savings, and economic growth that would be provided. This bill also provides more proof of what is plain: In this Republican-led Congress, it is, unfortunately, likely to go down in history as having failed to meet one of its greatest responsibil-ities of this time—the challenge of the changing climate. Our children and grandchildren will be poorer for it, and they will ask us, and especially my Re-publican colleagues: Why didn’t you act when you had the chance? Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
ENEGREEN ). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee for yielding me the time. I rise today in support of H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy In-frastructure Act. The Presidential permitting process dates back through many administra-tions, beginning with the administra-tion of Ulysses S. Grant. The executive branch has taken the necessary steps to ensure our cross-border infrastruc-ture with Canada and Mexico was con-structed. These past administrations, and even the current administration, were

forced to issue executive orders be-cause Congress failed to act. Congress has the duty to regulate the commerce of the United States, and cross-border energy infrastructure projects fall well within that space. Opponents of this bill argue the exec-utive permitting process has worked well in the past. It is true that in the past the process has been proven effec-tive. Unfortunately, cross-border deci-sions have now fallen victim to elec-tion year-cycle politics. We cannot build infrastructure in this country or on the continent based on who sits in the White House, wheth-er they be Democrat or Republican. It is Congress’ responsibility to create regulatory rules by which infrastruc-ture is constructed. b1545 This bill will create a regulatory process at the Federal Energy Regu-latory Commission, the Department of State, and the Department of Energy to permit cross-border infrastructure. It is not different than building roads, bridges, or railways. The Department of Transportation coordinates with the Federal, State, and local agencies to ensure projects are completed and the environment is protected. We will do the same thing for pipes and wires. We need to build electric transmission lines and pipelines to move resources from where they are to where they are needed. The bill complies with the National Environmental Policy Act and requires a full environmental review of any cross-border facility including analysis of climate change impacts. More so, the entire length of the pipeline or electric transmission line will be re-viewed for environmental impacts not just for the cross-border pipeline. While there is some confusion on this issue, opponents of the bill talk about how we will gut the NEPA process—the National Environmental Policy Act. This is simply not the case. My col-league from Texas (Mr. V
EASEY ) will offer a bipartisan amendment to the bill clarifying that the scope of the Na-tional Environmental Policy Act re-view shall not be limited in any way by this act. The bill is about the future and how to meet energy demands for the 21st century. We should embrace the changes taking place in North America and harmonize our policies with those of our neighbors both to the north with Canada and to the south with Mexico, and this bill, if it becomes law, will do that. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, we are here talking about how to take politics out of our infrastructure. As we just heard the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
ENE G
REEN ), this is a bipartisan bill. We hear a lot of stuff about it damaging the environment; it doesn’t. We are talking about crossing a border and taking a situation that was held up for 8 years with the Keystone pipeline and making sure it has the transparent and consistent approach on how we regu-late these permits. The United States is a powerhouse around the world. We want to keep it that way. We want our country to com-pete freely in the global market and continue to positively benefit our econ-omy. My bill, H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act, supports the construction of en-ergy infrastructure across our North America borders. Simply put, this bill takes the poli-tics out of energy infrastructure projects. The construction of these bor-der-crossing facilities should be done effectively and efficiently without get-ting caught up in our Nation’s politics. These facilities are used for importing and exporting oil, natural gas, and electricity that enhance the trade of our energy products that benefit our economy. This bipartisan piece of legislation allows a transparent and efficient proc-ess to be followed the same way every time and for every project. Most impor-tantly, it provides regulatory certainty to those charged with carrying out these projects. I want to thank this House for allowing such bills to come forth and the opportunity to allow this bill to be heard. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-man, lest anyone be left with the im-pression that there is a problem with cross-border pipeline approvals, the U.S. Energy Information Administra-tion, from a December 2016 report, says that over the last 5 years, natural gas pipeline capacity between the U.S. and Mexico has grown substantially and is projected to double through 2018. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GON-
ZALEZ ). Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Chair-man, I rise in support of H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infra-structure Act. This bill would enact crucial reforms allowing efficient trade of energy prod-ucts with our North American friends and allies. Unfortunately, the existing process has politicized vital cross-bor-der energy infrastructure. H.R. 2883 offers a narrowly crafted, sensible solution to this problem. The bill will create a process at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, State Department, and the Department of Energy to permit cross-border infra-structure projects. This new procedure will bring regu-latory certainty while ensuring these projects are environmentally sound and within public interest. These projects create jobs in my district in south Texas and across the country. I congratulate and thank Mr. G
REEN  and Mr. M
ULLIN for this important piece of legislation. Energy security, targeted regulatory reforms, and smart infrastructure investments are things we can all support, and we should all support. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this sensible bipartisan legislation. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chairman, as you have heard, two of my colleagues from Texas have just come out, obviously, in support of this bill. There is not a lot that Texas and Oklahoma agree on, es-pecially this time of the year when we enter football season. Other than that, we agree that Oklahoma is better at football than Texas. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MULLIN. I yield to the gen-tleman. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Congress-man MULLIN for partnering together. Like he said, Texas and Oklahoma have a lot of things in common. We both are energy States. But believe me, the Red River does divide us on foot-ball. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chairman, I in-clude in the R
ECORD a letter from the International Union of Operating Engi-neers, a letter from Edison Electric In-stitute, a letter from the IOSA, and a letter from the Plains All American Pipeline all in support of this bill.

EAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : The International Union of Operating Engi-neers (IUOE) supports H.R. 2883, the Cross- Border Energy Infrastructure Act, legisla-tion that provides clear congressional au-thority to the process of evaluating transnational pipeline projects. Further, the IUOE endorses H.R. 2910, a bill Promoting Inter-Agency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act. We respectfully request that you support both of these pieces of legislation when they come to the floor of the House of Representa-tives this week. The International Union of Operating En-gineers represents 400,000 working men and women in the United States and Canada, thousands of whom build and maintain the nation’s energy infrastructure. We are one of four unions that are signatory to the Na-tional Pipeline Agreement. Operating Engi-neers perform millions of hours of work on pipeline projects around the United States every year; millions of additional hours were performed on pipeline work by IUOE mem-bers in Canada. North America’s energy network is inex-tricably linked. Eliminating legal and regu-latory uncertainty regarding the permitting of cross-border energy facilities will promote investment and job creation in North Amer-ica, and that is why the IUOE supports H.R. 2883. Removing these regulatory barriers will ultimately increase the interconnection of the North American energy network and at the same time improve reliability, security, and affordability. Today, the process for permitting this en-ergy infrastructure lives only through Exec-utive Order. North America’s energy future is simply too important to leave to the ambi-guity and imprecision of administrative fiat.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H6013 July 19, 2017 
Granting clear legislative authority and del-egating responsibility to an agency experi-enced with the National Environmental Pol-icy Act and permitting processes, the Fed-eral Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), rather than the Department of State, will in-crease the competency and capacity of the review of cross-border energy projects. It is a clear improvement in the administration of major project permitting. Updating the American domestic permit-ting and regulatory framework for natural- gas pipelines is also essential. Several steps are necessary in this regard, and H.R. 2910 is one of them. Domestic energy production provides good-paying jobs for members of the IUOE and other construction craftworkers and continues to employ thousands of our members. Uncertainty and delay during en-vironmental reviews, however, hinder the growth of jobs related to the nation’s energy infrastructure. Congress should give FERC additional tools to keep federal agencies ac-countable and maximize coordination in the permitting process. H.R. 2910 requires reporting and trans-parency in the review of major projects. These requirements raise the bar for regu-lators and provides the public with a better understanding of the environmental impacts that are receiving particular rigor and exam-ination—or perhaps needlessly delaying the overall project-review timeline. Democrats and Republicans supported similar reporting and transparency in the FAST Act. Enact-ment of H.R. 2910 is a necessary step to help place the booming energy sector on a sound footing for the future. The International Union of Operating En-gineers supports both H.R. 2883 and H.R. 2910 and respectfully requests that you support the legislation this week when it comes be-fore you. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, J

ELOSI : The Edison Electric Institute sup-ports H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act, which is sched-uled for floor action this week. Timely decisions for the siting and permit-ting of energy infrastructure are essential to building the smarter and more resilient in-frastructure that electric companies need to deliver reliable, affordable, safe, and increas-ingly clean energy to Americans. H.R. 2883 would replace the need for a presidential per-mit for transmission lines or pipelines that cross a U.S. border with a certificate of crossing to be approved by the Department of Energy for electric transmission facilities, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-sion for oil or natural gas pipelines. The Na-tional Environmental Policy Act and other federal laws that apply to the project would not be affected. H.R. 2883 would improve the process for de-cisions on cross-border projects while pro-tecting the public’s interest in such projects. We urge the House to pass H.R. 2883. Sincerely, T

EARCHAIRMAN UPTON AND RANKING MEM-
BER RUSH: The In Situ Oil Sands Alliance (IOSA) offers strong support for the Pro-moting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act reintroduced by Congressman Markwayne Mullin (R–OK) and Congressman Gene Green (D–TX) and urges you to back its timely passage. IOSA is an alliance of Cana-dian oil sands developers dedicated to the re-sponsible development of the resource using drilling technologies. We support this legis-lation as it establishes greater predictability in the process of developing additional en-ergy transportation links between our two countries which will serve a critical role in continuing towards North American energy independence and reducing dependence on unstable overseas suppliers. These links will help to ensure that growing Canadian oil sands production remains a secure, afford-able, environmentally responsible and eco-nomically beneficial source of supply for the United States. Historically, Canada and the United States have enjoyed a mutually beneficial energy trade relationship. The Canadian oil sands provide substantial economic benefits to U.S.—for every two oil sands jobs created in Canada, one job is created in the U.S. Nearly 1,600 U.S. companies directly supply the oil sands, representing $1.9 billion in sales in 2014 and 2015. Canada is the United States’ most trusted trading partner, providing 41% of U.S. oil imports in 2016. Canada’s oil sands represent the third larg-est reserves in the world and are well-posi-tioned to provide a secure and affordable supply for American refining and consump-tion for years to come. However, the benefits accruing to the United States from Canadian oil sands development depend on sufficient energy transportation infrastructure capac-ity. The Promoting Cross-Border Energy In-frastructure Act proposes four key mod-ernizations of the cross-border infrastructure regulatory process that can ensure the time-ly development of projects: Introduction of a Definitive Decision Timeline: Introducing timing and develop-ment certainty currently absent from the approval process, the Act requires a decision no later than 120 days after any applicable environmental review is complete. Determination of National Interest: Lead agencies would be able to make national in-terest determination for cross border energy infrastructure projects but the assumption would be that cross border energy projects are in the national interest unless deter-mined otherwise by that lead agency. Agency Decision-Making: By removing the requirement for a Presidential permit, the relevant official or agency would serve as final authority, further streamlining the process while assuring that the lead agency is the Federal agency with relevant subject- matter expertise. The bill would designate FERC as the responsible official for oil and gas pipelines and the Secretary of Energy for electric transmission lines. These agencies already have responsibility for evaluating aspects affecting the national interest with respect to these types of projects. The only change from current practice is to substitute FERC for the Secretary of State as lead with respect to oil pipelines. This change is appro-priate given the level of expertise at FERC for review and approval of liquid pipeline projects, including rate setting and ensuring equal access. Streamlining of the approval process: New certificates of crossings and Presidential permits would not be required for modifica-tions to existing border-crossing projects that are operating or for which approvals have previously been issued. The Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infra-structure Act will serve to enhance the ex-isting mutually beneficial Canada-U.S. en-ergy partnership. Thank you for your consid-eration of and support for the Act. Sincerely, P

EARCONGRESSMAN MULLIN AND CONGRESS -
MAN GREEN : I am writing on behalf of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. in support of your legislation, H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act. This legislation will provide the needed re-form of the existing Presidential Permit process for liquid pipeline projects crossing international borders. As you know, there is no authorizing statute from the Congress laying out the requirements for this pro-gram. There is no guidance in the law on what should be reviewed, and what can be ex-empted because it is too small to make a dif-ference. There are no laws on what criteria to use, what to examine, or a time certain for completing a review. The unfortunate re-sult of the lack of clear guidance is uncer-tainty and delay. In fact, the sum total of State Department rules and procedures for this process is one single page, so almost all applications can be dealt with subjectively, which results in a lack of certainty for our business. Plains All American experienced this un-certainty first hand when we purchased seven pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canadian border. The guidelines used by the State De-partment triggered our need to apply for a new presidential permit in 2012. These pipe-lines already had an ownership ‘‘name change’’ permit application that remained pending from their previous change of owner-ship in 2007. Plains applications for ‘‘name change’’ permits remained pending until 2016. So, for 4 years, the State Department had been considering whether to issue a pres-idential permit for something almost as sim-ple as a name change at the top of the per-mit. There were no operational changes of the pipelines, no change in materials or any physical or environmental impacts. Hopefully, having this process come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regu-latory Commission will provide an objective standard with set timelines that will provide greater certainty. Thank you for your work, Best, H
ARRY N. P EFANIS , President & COO, Plains All American Pipeline. 
Mr. MULLIN. Once again, I under-stand that there is opposition to the bill because of a fear. But the true fear is: Are we willing to hold up the infra-structure needs of this country for po-litical gain? For the years that we had from the previous administration, that is exactly what happened. It was polit-ical.

What we are trying to do when we take it out of the State Department’s hands and put it with FERC is put it with a bipartisan oversight agency that takes an approach to looking at the infrastructure needs that this country has and saying: Is this in the country’s best interest? They have been doing it, and they do it well. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-man, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

EAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the undersigned organizations and our millions of members and supporters across the coun-try, we write today to express our strong op-position to H.R. 2883, the ‘‘Promoting Cross- Border Energy Infrastructure Act.’’ This bill represents a fourth irresponsible attempt to pass the previously titled ‘‘North American Energy Infrastructure Act’’ in as many years. For the reasons below, we are opposed to the passage of this legislation and its at-tempt to ram through permits for new cross- border oil and gas pipelines and electric transmission lines without meaningful envi-ronmental review or public participation. Our reasons for opposing H.R. 2883 are as follows: It is unnecessary and eliminates long-standing procedure. Executive Order 13337 es-tablished a longstanding process that has been used by both Republican and Demo-cratic administrations for decades to ensure that energy transmission projects crossing our international borders from Canada and Mexico are in the national interest. It eliminates critical environmental and economic analysis. H.R. 2883 eliminates the current requirement that proposed oil and natural gas pipelines and electric trans-mission lines that cross the U.S. border with Mexico or Canada obtain a presidential per-mit, after an environmental review and de-termination that the project is in the na-tional interest. It irresponsibly narrows the scope of envi-ronmental review. HR 2883 replaces existing processes with one that limits environ-mental review to a narrow portion of the project, exempts certain types of projects from any permit requirement, and shifts the burden of proof to make it difficult to not approve a project. It undermines the National Environmental Policy Act. The bill effectively exempts cross-border projects from meaningful envi-ronmental review under the National Envi-ronmental Policy Act (NEPA) by dramati-cally narrowing the focus of that review. Under the bill, the permit requirement and NEPA review apply only to the cross-border segment of the project. Trans-boundary pipe-lines and transmission lines are multi-billion dollar infrastructure investments that stretch hundreds of miles, last for decades, and pose environmental risks well beyond their border crossings. However, contrary to NEPA, the bill precludes review of the project’s full impacts, such as oil spills and the consequences for landowners, public safe-ty, drinking water, climate change, and wild-life. It eliminates the need to justify projects as in the national interest. The bill eliminates the requirement that to issue a permit, the federal permitting agency must find the project to be in the national interest. In-stead, the bill requires an agency to approve the project, unless it finds that the narrow segment that crosses the border ‘‘is not in the public interest of the United States.’’ By shifting the burden of proof to require a showing that the project is contrary to the public interest and sharply narrowing the focus of that inquiry, this provision makes it extremely difficult for an agency to ever deny a permit, and it largely eliminates the ability to approve a permit subject to protec-tive conditions. Large, complicated, risky projects like oil and gas pipelines and electric transmission facilities are precisely the types of activities that ought to be well-planned and reviewed before they are built. Failure to do so not only results in threats to public safety, but can also harm our economy and environ-ment. Instead of improving responsible siting, construction, and operation of oil and gas pipelines and electric transmission facilities, this bill goes in the opposite direction by forcing these projects through no matter what the costs may be. For these reasons, we urge you to oppose this bill.

JULY18, 2017. Re Oppose H.R. 2910 and H.R. 2883, Dangerous Handouts to the Oil and Gas Industry. D
EARREPRESENTATIVE : The League of Con-servation Voters (LCV) works to turn envi-ronmental values into national priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National Envi-ronmental Scorecard, which details the vot-ing records of members of Congress on envi-ronmental legislation. The Scorecard is dis-tributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and the media. LCV urges you to vote NO on H.R. 2910, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Re-view of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, and H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy In-frastructure Act. H.R. 2910 sacrifices public input and thor-ough environmental review in favor of giving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) more power to fast-track approval of interstate natural gas pipelines. FERC has no accountability to the public or the envi-ronment, yet this bill would allow it to limit the participation and input of other state and federal agencies with relevant expertise in reviews required under the National Envi-ronmental Policy Act (NEPA). Additionally, H.R. 2910 would allow FERC to establish the scope of the environmental review and condi-tionally approve projects with incomplete environmental impact analysis, which could result in irreversible harm to our environ-ment and public health. Given FERC’s his-tory of rash approval of pipelines, H.R. 2910 is unnecessary, dangerous, and nothing more than a handout to the oil and gas industry at the expense of the health and safety of our communities. H.R. 2883 would greenlight permitting of new, potentially harmful cross-border oil and gas pipelines and electric transmission lines without meaningful and thorough review and oversight. It eliminates many important longstanding procedures, undermining crit-ical environmental and economic review by abolishing the requirement that a project ob-tain a presidential permit and be affirma-tively determined to be in the public inter-est. H.R. 2883 also narrows the scope of envi-ronmental review under NEPA, exempting certain projects altogether and severely lim-iting the review of these massive, expensive, long-lasting infrastructure projects to only the section that crosses the border, ignoring the potential damaging impacts from the project as a whole. By only reviewing a small portion of these projects and essentially erasing the national interest requirement, this bill would make it almost impossible for an agency to ever deny a permit and could result in irreversible damage to our health, public safety, climate, environment, and economy. Again, we urge you to REJECT H.R. 2910 and H.R. 2883, and will consider including votes on these bills in the 2017 Scorecard. Sincerely, GENEKARPINSKI , President.

Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-man, H.R. 2883 eliminates the current requirement that proposed oil and nat-ural gas pipelines and electric trans-mission lines that cross the U.S. border obtain a Presidential permit. That only happens after an environmental review and a determination that the project is in the national interest. I know this might be tempting to some of my col-leagues, but I encourage you to have a closer look at what this bill really does. The bill replaces this process with a new process that limits environmental review to a narrow portion of the project, just the portion that crosses the border. It exempts certain types of projects from any permit requirement and shifts the burden of proof to make it difficult to disapprove a project. The bill also allows a project that is rejected under current law to reapply under the new, weaker process and ex-empts all modifications to existing cross-border projects from any require-ment for Federal review or approval. In essence, it grants a get-out-of-jail- free card, or, actually, I guess it is more akin to whatever you roll, you get to pass go, and you get to collect your $200. That is not okay for some international oil pipelines, natural gas pipelines, and electric transmission lines. These are major infrastructure projects, and we have got to maintain the ability to have a meaningful re-view; otherwise, we are going to suffer significant incidents, accidents, fatali-ties, and more. So let me close my remarks and my portion of the debate here today. I have enjoyed this debate, but I want to high-light again that the Congress is really missing an opportunity to address one of the most significant challenges that we face, and that is the challenge of climate change. What is particularly troubling about this bill, as well, is it keeps the public in the dark. Think about it. If you live near a major international pipeline project, shouldn’t you have the right to participate and understand what such project will allow in your backyard? The bill would allow large and long- lived cross-border energy projects to be approved with no understanding or consideration of their environmental impact or to be exempted from any per-mitting requirement at all. The bill as-sumes that these projects are always in the public interest regardless of the merits. It is an unjustifiable giveaway. It elevates corporate profits over the public interest, and it is wrong. The public, including communities and landowners directly affected by the projects, would have little or no infor-mation and no opportunity to object or request mitigating action except to the extent provided under limited State laws. For all of these reasons, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ). Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong oppo-sition to the bills we are considering today which would short-circuit the approval process of fossil fuel projects at the expense of our environment and private property owners. In my home State of New Hampshire, Granite Staters are all too familiar with the problems of siting natural gas projects and the disruption this can cause for small rural towns. In 2015, energy giant Kinder Morgan proposed a large natural gas pipeline project that would have cut through 17 New Hampshire towns in my district which are home to numerous environ-mentally sensitive areas that would have been negatively impacted by this project. Throughout the review process, I heard from thousands of my constitu-ents whose concerns were not being heard by the Federal Energy Regu-latory Commission. Thanks to the commitment and tire-less efforts of these advocates, Kinder Morgan eventually pulled the plug on the project, but there is so much more that needs to be done to give average citizens a seat at the table during FERC’s review process. The bills we are considering today would do nothing to elevate the con-cerns of impacted communities during the FERC proceedings, and these bills aim to jam through risky pipeline projects while constraining other agen-cies from concluding important envi-ronmental reviews. We all know that FERC acts as a rub-ber stamp for fossil fuel projects, and the bills we are considering today fur-ther narrow the opportunities for pri-vate landowners to push back against projects and try to protect their land from eminent domain. b1600 At a time when pipeline expansion has increased dramatically, we should be working on bipartisan solutions that increase public participation dur-ing FERC proceedings. That is why I have cosponsored legislation to create an Office of Public Participation with-in FERC that would level the playing field for average citizens and give them a seat at the table. H.R. 2910, which we just debated, does nothing to achieve this goal and will only lead to more communities being left in the dark during FERC pro-ceedings. H.R. 2883 would eliminate the need for a Presidential permit for cross-bor-der energy projects and dramatically narrow the environmental review to the narrow portion of the project that crosses the border. These cross-border projects are oftentimes hundreds of miles long. It simply makes no sense to conduct an environmental review on the small portion that crosses the bor-der. That is just common sense. For the good of our environment, for the good of our communities and public lands, I urge my colleagues to oppose these harmful pieces of legislation. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chairman, I actu-ally have a couple of more speakers. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Florida may re-claim her time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I was under the impression the other side had yielded back the balance of her time. The CHAIR. The gentleman is cor-rect, but by unanimous consent, the gentlewoman may reclaim the time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I ask unani-mous consent to allow the minority to reclaim the balance of her time.

Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infra-structure Act, introduced by my friend and Great Plains colleague to the south, M
ARKWAYNE MULLIN . This bill could not come at a better time. As we continue to have discus-sions in this country about both our fu-ture as an energy leader and our trad-ing relationship with Mexico and Can-ada, it is time to review bureaucratic permitting processes that constrain new energy transportation projects. This bill does just that. It improves and streamlines the permitting process for pipelines and energy transmission equipment when they are crossing U.S. international borders. Energy trade within North America is a nearly $150 billion business that provides significant benefits here at home. This bill shows that we can focus on protecting our environment and being an energy leader. It main-tains full environmental reviews and continues compliance with the Na-tional Environmental Policy Act. We saw how broken our current regu-latory structure was when politics and personal interests nearly ended the Keystone XL pipeline without any re-gard to science, facts, or the liveli-hoods of the people who needed those jobs. This legislation will allow Amer-ican entrepreneurs to stop fighting endless red tape and uncertain timelines and get back to doing what we do best: creating jobs, innovating, and making North America a leader in energy production. Voters have told us time and time again to get the bureaucratic morass of Big Government out of the way. They have asked us to promote an all-of-the- above energy strategy that includes oil and gas and to unleash the power of free trade and American innovation. They have asked for good jobs and more energy security. I thank my good friend from Okla-homa for sponsoring this. I ask my col-leagues to support H.R. 2838, the Pro-moting Cross-Border Energy Infra-structure Act. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair-man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. M

CNERNEY. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding. Mr. Chair, I stand up to oppose H.R. 2883. Basically, what this bill does is preapproves border-crossing energy products by making it extremely dif-ficult to put a stop to them on any grounds. As a general matter, specifically for oil pipelines, within the United States, oil pipelines don’t need Federal ap-proval. No Federal reviews or permits on these projects are required. If the pipeline harms endangered species, the ESA will apply. If the construction de-stroys wetlands, a project permit may be needed from the Corps of Engineers. But generally, neither of these require-ments trigger a broader evaluation of the project. Currently, the only reason to prepare an environmental assess-ment or impact for cross-border pipe-lines or transmission lines is because the existing Presidential permit re-quirement triggers NEPA. Under this bill, there would be no projectwide Federal environmental as-sessment for all these projects. State laws don’t substitute for NEPA. Many States don’t have approval authority over pipelines within their States. The CHAIR. The time of the gen-tleman has expired. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. MCNERNEY. Even those States with some instate authority don’t have the resources or expertise to develop the information provided by a Federal environmental impact statement. No State has permitting authority over the portions of a pipeline located in other States. Without NEPA, there would be no broad Federal environ-mental review of cross-border trans-mission lines. Mr. Chair, we need these protections, and I ask my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2883. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
ENE G
REEN ), my good friend. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, there seems to be some confu-sion here that this bill takes away Na-tional Environmental Policy Act en-forcement. That is just not true. In fact, during a committee hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee, we produced a Congressional Research Service report that said that nothing in this bill will take away the responsi-bility for the NEPA process, the Na-tional Environmental Policy Act. To make sure that every inch of those pipelines will be studied for envi-ronmental issues is not our intention. Our intention is just to move product. We will go through all the efforts. Mr. Chair, I include in the R
ECORD a report from the Congressional Re-search Service that we got in com-mittee. 
[From the Congressional Research Service, May 2, 2017] M
EMORANDUM  To: The Honorable Gene Green; Attention: Justin Ackley From: Linda Luther, Analyst in Environ-mental Policy, ext. 7–6852 Subject: Scope of NEPA Review Required for Federal Agency Approvals This memorandum responds to your re-quest asking CRS to clarify the scope of an environmental review prepared by federal agencies under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). More specifically, you asked CRS to identify the scope of environ-mental impacts that a federal agency would be likely to evaluate before making a final decision on a request to approve certain en-ergy infrastructure projects that would cross a United States border, such as the issuance of a ‘‘certificate of crossing’’ that would be required in the Promoting Cross-Border En-ergy Infrastructure Act (discussion draft re-leased April 25, 2017). This memorandum identifies the range of environmental im-pacts that federal agencies currently evalu-ate when demonstrating compliance with NEPA. It also discusses current agency prac-tices, for similar projects, that generally in-volve the evaluation of the environmental impacts of any new facilities constructed in the United States (i.e., impacts that may occur as a result of approving a cross-border energy infrastructure project). Information in this memorandum may be used or may have been used in other CRS products. Before a federal agency can make a final decision on a proposed federal action, NEPA requires that agency to identify the pro-posal’s effects on the ‘‘quality of the human environment.’’ The scope and level of review required under NEPA depends on whether those effects will be ‘‘significant.’’ To make that determination, each agency must iden-tify and evaluate the proposal’s— Direct effects—impacts caused by the project and occurring at the same time and place, including impacts directly associated with the construction and operation of the facilities;. Indirect effects—impacts that are later in time or farther removed in distance, but still reasonably foreseeable; and Cumulative effects—impacts on the envi-ronment that result from the incremental impacts of the action when added to other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable fu-ture actions, regardless of what agency (fed-eral or non-federal) or person undertakes that other action. If an agency is authorized to approve a cross-border facility (e.g., issue a certificate of crossing for certain energy infrastructure projects as in the proposed bill), that agen-cy’s decision must be informed by appro-priate environmental review required under NEPA. As federal agencies currently imple-ment NEPA, the requirement to identify and consider direct, indirect, and cumulative im-pacts has meant that the agency evaluates the effects of siting, building and operating the entire structure in the United States (not just the cross-border segment they are authorized to approve). That is, if a federal agency is authorized to approve a cross-bor-der project, that agency’s existing NEPA practices would likely continue to involve analysis of impacts associated with the ap-proval of the facility that physically crosses the border, as well as any new facilities con-structed in the United States. I hope this information is useful to you. Please feel free to contact me if you have ad-ditional questions. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, the other issue, though, is we are going to do belts and suspenders. That is an old saying I heard. We al-ready had a belt, but now we are going to deal with an amendment from Con-gressman V
EASEY . We will make sure it is belts and suspenders and that the National Environmental Policy Act is applied to these pipelines, because that is not our intent. So we not only have the Congres-sional Research Service saying it is, we are going to put language into this bill, and I understand it will be accepted by our side, to make sure that is there. What we need to do is make sure that our closest neighbors, Canada and Mex-ico—right now, Mexico needs the nat-ural gas that we are producing in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and New Mexico; but 20 years from now, our wells may be dry for natural gas, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H6017 July 19, 2017 
we will need that natural gas that Mex-ico will be producing when they work in northern Mexico. So that is why we need to struc-turalize this, if we are really going to have a North American energy market for electric transmission like they do up in the New England States or elec-tric transmissions even along the bor-der in Texas. I know they do the same thing in southern California. We need to have some certainty with our clos-est neighbors. We have a free trade agreement with these two countries. It is already de-cided it is in our national interest. Why would we set aside energy as something different? That is why this bill is so important. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote for this legislation. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-zona (Mr. G
OSAR ). Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy In-frastructure Act, introduced by my friend and Western Caucus member M
ARKWAYNE MULLIN . H.R. 2883 streamlines the permitting process for pipelines and electricity transmission equipment that crosses the United States’ international bor-ders. Energy trade between the U.S., Mex-ico, and Canada is nearly a $150 billion business that provides significant bene-fits to America. This bill will prevent another Keystone XL-like delay and takes politics out of the decision-making process. Cross-border oil and gas pipelines and cross-border electric transmission fa-cilities should not be held up by gov-ernment bureaucracies. Without this legislation, important projects that provide benefits to our economy will continue to incur unnecessary delays and government red tape. Edison Electric Institute supports H.R. 2883, stating: 
Timely decisions for the sifting and per-mitting of energy infrastructure are essen-tial to building more resilient infrastructure that electric companies need to deliver reli-able, affordable, safe, and increasingly clean energy to Americans. 
The National Taxpayers Union sup-ports the bill, stating: 
This legislation would streamline the ar-chaic cross-border permitting process for en-ergy facilities that stretch across the bor-ders we share with Mexico and Canada. 
The current Presidential permit re-gime is far from clear and can leave projects in regulatory limbo for years to come. Creating a consolidated and standardized approval process would increase the congressional account-ability provided for in Article I, sec-tion 8 of the Constitution. The bill requires a full environ-mental review and complies with NEPA. This legislation makes so much sense that even labor unions support it. Let’s fulfill our constitutional obliga-tions, streamline important energy in-frastructure projects, and advance a true all-of-the-above energy strategy. I thank the gentleman from Okla-homa for sponsoring this much-needed legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this commonsense bill. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chair, I strongly urge the Mem-bers of this body to oppose this mis-guided bill so that the Congress can turn its attention to the most daunting challenge of our time: climate change, our clean energy future, and the clean energy economy and all of the jobs it entails. Mr. Chair, again, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, this bill has absolutely no effect on any environmental law. The bill expressly provides that approval of a project under this act does not affect the application of any other Federal laws that are applicable to the con-struction, operation, or maintenance of a project. The Congressional Research Service has reviewed the legislation and has confirmed that fact. My point is, other than the fact that they just want to oppose this because, maybe, people oppose fossil fuels as a whole, this makes sense. This is a bill that moves forward. As we stated ear-lier, it takes politics out of our permit-ting process. It brings structure and certainty to those that are providing our infrastructure needs. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The CHAIR. All time for general de-bate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5- minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the na-ture of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and Com-merce, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5- minute rule an amendment in the na-ture of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–29. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the na-ture of a substitute is as follows: H.R. 2883 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . ENGEL  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 115–235. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 2, after line 16, insert the following: (i) the Secretary of State with respect to border-crossing facilities consisting of oil pipelines; Page 2, line 17, strike ‘‘(i)’’ and insert ‘‘(ii)’’. Page 2, line 19, strike ‘‘oil or’’. Page 2, line 21, strike ‘‘(ii)’’ and insert ‘‘(iii)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 454, the gentleman from New York (Mr. E
NGEL ) and a Member op-posed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, since 1968, oil pipelines that cross inter-national borders have been reviewed and authorized by the Department of State. That is nearly 50 years. This is common sense. After all, the State De-partment handles diplomacy, the State Department manages treaties related to our international boundaries, and the State Department is responsible for the security of pathways for our pipe-lines. But the bill we are considering today would shift decisionmaking authority for those pipelines from the State De-partment, which is equipped to handle all aspects of this issue, to Federal En-ergy Regulatory Commission, which isn’t equipped. So it just doesn’t make any sense to me, Mr. Chairman. It seems quite arbi-trary and quite foolish and moving in the wrong direction. This is change for change’s sake, and it wouldn’t improve the process. My amendment would prevent this mistake. It would simply ensure that permitting authority for cross-border oil pipelines remains with the Depart-ment of State. That is the permitting authority for cross-border oil pipelines to remain with the Department of State. In each of the past two Congresses, my friends in the majority agreed. They passed substantially similar leg-islation to change the cross-border pipeline permitting process, but they kept the final approval authority where it belongs, with the Department of State. Cross-border oil pipelines are matters of international diplomacy and na-tional security, and oversight should remain with the State Department. The old adage, ‘‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,’’ I don’t know what we are trying to do here. So I urge support for my amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, H.R. 2883 was designated the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the lead agen-cy of the permitting cross-border oil pipelines. FERC is an independent agency made up of a bipartisan commission that reg-ulates interstate transmission of elec-tricity, natural gas, and oil. FERC also reviews proposals to build liquefied natural gas terminals, interstate nat-ural gas pipelines, and cross-border natural gas facilities. FERC has a proven track record of working with a wide array of stake-holders on complex pipeline projects to balance the public interest. It is clear-ly the best suited agency for the job of permitting cross-border oil pipelines. As we learned from the Keystone XL experience during the Obama adminis-tration, the State Department lacks the ability to pull out politics from our Nation’s infrastructure. There is noth-ing in this bill that would prevent the State Department from being con-sulted about an application, but FERC should take the lead on cross-border oil pipelines. H.R. 2883 would provide the permit-ting process with much-needed consist-ency and transparency. The gentle-man’s amendment would double down on the failures of the past and reinject bipartisan politics into the process. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ on this amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. E
NGEL ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the

AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MS . TSONGAS  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 2 printed in part B of House Report 115–235. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 3, after line 14, insert the following: (D) A
DDITIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR OIL AND  
NATURAL GAS PIPELINE FACILITIES .—In the case of a request for a certificate of crossing for a border-crossing facility consisting of an oil or natural gas pipeline facility, the Fed-eral Energy Regulatory Commission may not issue a certificate of crossing under subpara-graph (A) if any part of the oil or natural gas pipeline project is to be located on lands re-quired under Federal, State, or local law to be managed for purposes of natural resource conservation or recreation. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 454, the gentlewoman from Mas-sachusetts (Ms. T
SONGAS ) and a Mem-ber opposed each will control 5 min-utes. The Chair recognizes the gentle-woman from Massachusetts. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment protects a robust public re-view process for any proposed pipeline that seeks to cross protected conserva-tion and recreation lands, this time for pipelines that includes a crossing with Canada or Mexico. The legislation be-fore us today, with its narrowly defined environmental reviews and limited public input, puts treasured public re-sources at risk. My home State of Massachusetts, like many areas around the country, faces real energy challenges. We need careful and strategic long-term plan-ning in order to lower energy prices and increase reliability and resiliency. However, as with H.R. 2910 that we considered earlier this afternoon, H.R. 2883 moves us in the wrong direction. In fact, it doesn’t allow any careful or strategic planning when it comes to fossil fuel pipelines. Cross-border and natural gas pipeline interests should not be permitted to cavalierly tread on public lands, lands expressly set aside by Federal tax-payers, State and local communities for the benefit of conservation and pub-lic recreation. Our Nation has a longstanding his-tory of preserving natural habitats and protecting open spaces for the public benefit, and we have invested signifi-cant public resources toward these goals. These lands and the decisions be-hind them deserve to be honored. The potential negative environ-mental impacts of an oil or natural gas pipeline are too great to risk such treasured investments by Federal tax-payers and State and local commu-nities, and we should not quickly fore-go the essential public review process that has helped ensure these public treasures are available to future gen-erations. Mr. Chairman, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time for closing. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I don’t have any additional speakers. I would just like to say that energy infrastructure is critical to our econ-omy, yet we cannot simply give the fossil fuel industry a carte blanche to build pipelines that adversely impact conservation and recreation lands. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. In the United States today, there is 150 million acres of pro-tected land set aside in the National Wildlife Refuge System for protected designation for America’s fish, wildlife, and plants. Conservation efforts like the Na-tional Wildlife Refuge System build up America’s great conservation legacy that began with Teddy Roosevelt. En-suring that future generations of Americans have access to these great traditions must be our priority as a body going forward. In this 150 million acres of National Wildlife Refuge System land, though, there currently stretches 1,339 miles of pipeline already. Protecting our nat-ural resources and building much-need-ed infrastructure are not mutually ex-clusive goals. These pipelines are already there. They are not destroying the lands or their ecosystem or prohibiting the American people from enjoying access to this public land. Companies must pay the government for use of the land for pipelines. That money, in turn, goes into acquiring more land for conserva-tion efforts and recreational use. The Department of Transportation’s review of safety accidents conducted under President Obama’s administra-tion showed that in addition to pro-viding a substantial cost advantage, pipelines result in fewer spillage inci-dents and personal injuries than either road or rail. As coal-fired power plants continue to shut down, the demand for natural gas, a lower emission alternative, is going to keep going up. Whether the gas is produced in Canada, Alaska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, or the Gulf of Mexico, it will be used all over the country, and we need to ensure that a regulatory framework is in place that allows us to get this supply to where it is needed. The amendment is a backhanded way to prevent any pipelines or electrical transmission infrastructure from being built. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, H.R. 2883 strikes a right balance for wise man-agement of our multiuse public lands and natural resources. The amendment would upset this careful balance. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. WEBER of Texas). The question is on the amend-ment offered by the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. T
SONGAS ). The question was taken; and the Act-ing Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I de-mand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-ceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Massachusetts will be postponed.

ENE GREEN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, again, this is Congressman V
EASEY ’s idea, and I am doing it for him because he couldn’t be here. Our intent when crafting the bill was never to reduce or limit the National Environmental Policy Act applica-bility when considering whether to ap-prove a cross-border project. Before a Federal agency can make a final determination on a proposed Fed-eral action, the National Environ-mental Policy Act requires that the agency identify the proposal’s effects on the quality of human environment and whether these effects will be sig-nificant. To make this determination, Federal agencies identify and evaluate the di-rect and indirect cumulation of effects of the proposal. Direct effects are the impacts caused by the project occur-ring at the same time and place. Indi-rect effects are the impacts that are later in time or further removed but still reasonably foreseeable. And cumu-lative effects are impacts on the envi-ronment that result with incremental

impacts on the action, regardless of what person or agency undertakes that action. The Federal agencies currently im-plement NEPA. The requirement to identify all three of these impacts has required the analysis of impacts to in-clude not just the cross-border section of the project, but any new facility or structure constructed within the United States. Our office had the bill analyzed by the experts at the Congressional Re-search Office, who confirmed that the underlying bill did not in any way limit the scope of future National En-vironmental Policy Act reviews under it. Under our language, they will con-tinue to involve reviews of the entire project, not just that part that crosses the border section. With that said, I have heard concerns from Members who are worried that the bill will limit the NEPA in some way. I am happy to support this bipar-tisan amendment with my colleague, Mr. V
EASEY , which unequivocally states that nothing in this act or the amendments made by this act shall af-fect the scope of any review required to be conducted by the National Environ-mental Policy Act of 1969. I support this good faith amend-ment—and like I said earlier, it is belts and suspenders, but sometimes we need them to pass legislation—and I urge my colleagues to do so as well. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-tion, the gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-port of the gentleman’s amendment, which would clarify the intent of the legislation not to affect the application of any or other Federal laws that are applicable to the construction, oper-ation, or maintenance of the project. Despite the talking points used by some of my friends, nothing in this bill would exempt a project from com-plying with applicable environmental laws or restrict the scope of environ-mental review. The gentleman from Texas’ amend-ment makes this abundantly clear. H.R. 2883 would lead to a more objec-tive and timely decision, create jobs, strengthen our Nation’s energy secu-rity, and support affordable and reli-able energy for all Americans. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Texas (Mr. G
ENEGREEN ). The amendment was agreed to. b1630

b1703 So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. Stated against: Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably detained from the House floor. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 396 (Tsongas Amendment to H.R. 2833). The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. ROD-
NEYDAVIS of Illinois) having assumed the chair, Mr. W
EBER of Texas, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, re-ported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2883) to establish a more uniform, transparent, and modern process to au-thorize the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of inter-national border-crossing facilities for the import and export of oil and nat-ural gas and the transmission of elec-tricity, and, pursuant to House Resolu-tion 454, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is or-dered. Is a separate vote demanded on the amendment to the amendment re-ported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amend-ment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. O’HALLERAN. I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recom-mit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. O’Halleran moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2883 to the Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: Page 3, after line 14, insert the following: (D) A
MERICAN IRON AND STEEL .—As a condi-tion of issuing a certificate of crossing under subparagraph (A), the relevant official or agency shall require that all of the iron and steel products used in the construction, con-nection, operation, and maintenance of the border-crossing facility are produced in the United States, as determined by the relevant official or agency in a manner consistent with United States obligations under inter-national agreements.

to dispense with the reading of the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final pas-sage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, hardworking families across Arizona and across our country are sick and tired of Congress putting partisan politics ahead of creating jobs at home. As I travel across rural Arizona and speak to workers, miners, farmers, and families, I am asked the same ques-tions: ‘‘When is Congress going to get serious about helping rural America? ‘‘When are you guys going to work together and create good-paying jobs? ‘‘When are we going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and roads? ‘‘When are we finally going to get re-liable broadband?’’ In my 7 months in Congress, I have seen firsthand the failure to address these problems in a truly bipartisan manner. American workers are count-ing on all of us, Democrats and Repub-licans, to focus on bringing back jobs to our country. The underlying bill before us does not go far enough to ensure pipelines, which involve major investments and can span hundreds of miles across sen-sitive areas, are made with quality, re-liable, American-made materials. My commonsense amendment simply requires Federal agencies to certify that all of the iron and steel products used in any cross-border pipelines are produced in the United States before they can be approved. Mr. Speaker, foreign steelmakers now supply half the oil and gas drilling and extraction pipes used in the United States, and it is only getting worse. The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates that imports of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry are up 237 percent in the first half of 2017 from a year earlier. Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order instructing the Secretary of Commerce to develop a plan that would require any company building a pipeline within U.S. borders to use American-made materials and equipment. My amendment mirrors the spirit of that executive order by apply-ing the same rules to any proposed cross-border pipelines. Mr. Speaker, we need to rebuild America. We need to rebuild America’s infrastructure. We need to rebuild America’s energy infrastructure, but we need to rebuild America by creating American jobs. Mr. Speaker, I can think of no better message to send during President Trump’s ‘‘Made in America Week’’ than by standing up for American workers and supporting this common-sense amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, this is just a procedural motion to deny the important benefits of this legislation to the American workers, businesses, and our collective energy security. It fits a pattern of delay and obstruction that we simply cannot support. I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion to recommit and vote ‘‘yes’’ on final pas-sage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.

I am going to make everybody happy because I am going to be really quick about this. This MTR is just a rehash of an amendment that the other side of the aisle tried to introduce during the original bill. That amendment was not germane, and the reason it wasn’t ger-mane is because this bill does not af-fect eminent domain in any way what-soever. So the bottom line is, that this is just another procedural motion to deny the important benefits of this legisla-tion to American workers, to American businesses, and to our collective energy security. It fits a pattern of delay and obstruction that we simply cannot sup-port. Mr. Speaker, I urge our Members to oppose this procedural motion, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. 
RECORDED VOTE  
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of passage. This is a 5-minute vote.

COMMEMORATING 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF ERIE CANAL (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 200th anni-versary of the Erie Canal. Construction first began in 1817 in Rome, New York, with the first completed portion con-necting two cities in the 22nd Congres-sional District, Rome and Utica. The Erie Canal was transformative in establishing New York as the Empire State. The canal opened the interior of our Nation, allowing westward expan-sion and the free flow of goods. With a drastic 90 percent reduction in shipping costs, the canal established our region as a hub of economic activity in the early 20th century and made New York the busiest port in the entire Nation. In addition to the vast economic im-pact, the Erie Canal had an important cultural effect. Nearly 80 percent of up-state New York’s population lives within 25 miles of the canal. From Al-bany to Buffalo, today, the Erie Canal is designated as a National Heritage Area, continuing its rich legacy. This Saturday, a first dig celebration in Rome, New York, will recognize this historic and monumental achievement in both New York’s and our Nation’s history. In the words of the famous Erie Canal song: ‘‘You’ll always know your neighbor, and you’ll always know your pal, if you’ve ever navigated on the Erie Canal.’’ f 
b1800 HOMELESSNESS (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, today, homeless advocates from Rhode Island, including from Crossroads Rhode Is-land and from Rhode Island Housing, came to visit my office. Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to express in words how important their work is. These groups take care of the least among us. They provide shelter for the working poor and those affected by the opioid crisis, and they assist those not working because of age, infirmity, or disability. They help keep lives to-gether. They help keep families to-gether. Mr. Speaker, we must continue to provide strong funding for these pro-grams in our appropriations bills. We still have not fully emerged from the financial crisis and people are still try-ing to make ends meet. Foster youth are particularly vulnerable, with as many as 40 percent who age out of the system becoming homeless. Mr. Speaker, social services organi-zations and nonprofits can only do so much on their own. They need support to keep our vulnerable brothers and sisters from falling off a cliff. We can do better and we deserve to support them.

RECOGNIZING THE PADUCAH AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce for their des-ignation as the 2017 Chamber of the Year by the Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives. This national honor was awarded at the ACCE Na-tional Convention in Nashville, Ten-nessee, on July 18. This is the second win for the Padu-cah Area Chamber of Commerce in the last 6 years, and is national recogni-tion of the area’s national business leaders whose community contribu-tions are unparalleled.

As the largest city in the First Dis-trict of Kentucky, the chamber’s ef-forts have benefited not only the Padu-cah area, but positively impact com-munities throughout western Ken-tucky. I would like to thank President San-dra Wilson and Board Chair Tammy Zimmerman, as well as the board of di-rectors, staff, and chamber members for their unwavering dedication to the betterment of local industry. I look forward to many future accomplish-ments for the chamber, and I am proud to represent the thriving business lead-ers of Paducah.

NAFTA AND MADE IN AMERICA WEEK (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise be-cause President Trump has dubbed this week ‘‘Made in America Week.’’ But one can’t pretend one’s way to creating jobs in the United States, even if you are President. A key index that gives you a clue to the truth of job creation in the United States is the trade deficit: How many more products and services are country exports, rather than imports from off-shore sweatshops? Well, for every month of the Trump administration—that is what the red line is—the jobs hole for America is growing deeper. You see here that the May 2017 def-icit on this scorecard confirms the fail-ing Trump trade record, with a $46 bil-lion trade and jobs deficit for May alone—larger than last year, larger than every other month. The President spoke endlessly about trade during the campaign and prom-ised turning NAFTA into a good deal for Americans. Without a doubt, work-ing people of the Midwest put him in the Presidency because he promised to renegotiate NAFTA, that bad deal. Now it is his turn to live up to the bar-gain. There is an old expression, ‘‘Don’t tell me what he says, show me what he does.’’ Well, President Trump could start by onshoring all foreign goods he makes abroad—everything from ties, suits, bracelets, and so forth. I haven’t seen any inclination to date by this President reshoring items so that he creates jobs again in this coun-try. He contributes to a growing trade surplus, not a deficit.

RUMP ’S‘‘MADE IN AMERICA ’’ WEEK: THE P
RESIDENT ’SHYPOCRISY ISO N DISPLAY  (By Adam Gabbatt) The White House celebrates US-manufac-tured products this week, even though Trump’s vodka, menswear and even board games have been made overseas. Donald Trump has declared this week ‘‘Made in America’’ week. According to the White House, it’s an opportunity for the president to showcase ‘‘products that are made in America’’. Unfortunately for Trump, that description would rule out many of the products he and members of his family have made and sold. From Donald J Trump Collection clothing to Trump Vodka to Trump: the Game, the president has a track record of not making things in America. The week was scheduled to kick off at the White House on Monday, with Trump walk-ing around some tables looking at products made in all 50 states. So in honour of the president’s communist-dictator-esque photo opportunity, here’s a look at some not-made- in-America Trump gear. ALCOHOL  Trump Vodka (‘‘The finish is disappoint-ingly harsh’’—InternetWines.com) was an ill- fated attempt by Trump to branch into the spirits world. The vodka (‘‘No discernable flavor’’—Chicagoist) was manufactured in the Netherlands by a company called Wan-ders Distillery and launched in the US in 2006. But the beverage (‘‘My taste buds unfortu-nately associate the flavor with the smell of paint’’—VodkaBuzz) failed to sell. The trade-mark was abandoned in 2008, according to Rolling Stone. By 2011, Trump Vodka was ‘‘out of circulation’’. ‘‘We don’t need Chinese products,’’ Trump told Fox News in 2010. ‘‘The stuff that’s been sent over from China is—it falls apart after a year and a half. It’s crap.’’ It was an odd thing to say for a self-de-scribed master businessman offering to the American public many menswear products— featured in the Donald J Trump Signature Collection—that were made in China. Donald J Trump eyeglasses were made in China. Donald Trump’s ties were made in China. Some of the Donald J Trump suits were made in China. To be fair, Trump is an equal opportunity overseas manufacturer. His dress shirts have been manufactured in Bangladesh, Honduras and Vietnam. And China. It turned out Trump was right about peo-ple not needing Chinese products. In 2015, the Donald I Trump Signature Collection was jettisoned by Macy’s. His famous red hats, meanwhile, actually are made in the US. It’s the unofficial ones that aren’t. 
EDUCATION  Trump University (‘‘A fraud from begin-ning to end’’—New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman) was a US business. But the university, which was not actually an accredited university, encouraged stu-dents to outsource jobs overseas. ‘‘We hear terrible things about outsourcing jobs—how sending work outside of our com-panies is contributing to the demise of American businesses,’’ Trump wrote on the Trump University blog in 2005. ‘‘But in this instance I have to take the unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible thing.’’ In November 2016, Trump settled three fraud lawsuits relating to the university for $25m. 
HOMEWARE  ‘‘Several Trump Home items are listed as made in China or imported from China the Washington Post reported in 2016. According to the Post, foreign-made items in Trump’s furniture collection include mir-rors, ceramic vases, wall decorations, kitch-en items and lighting fixtures. They were all made in China. Some Trump Home picture frames were manufactured in India. Earlier this year, Peter York, who wrote a 2006 book about the homes of autocrats, in-cluding Saddam Hussein and Nicolae Ceaus¸escu, wrote about the similarities be-tween their tastes and Trump’s interior decor preferences. ‘‘The best aesthetic descriptor of Trump’s look, I’d argue, is dictator style,’’ York said. BOARD GAMES  Trump: the Game (‘‘I loathed every miser-able second of it’’—Ars Technica) was launched in 1989, then pushed out again in 2004 after Trump became host of The Appren-tice. The game (‘‘Bizarre’’—Business Insider) was manufactured in the US by Milton Brad-ley Company. But the dice, according to this photo of the Trump: the Game packaging, were made in China. It is difficult to tell if the dice were ‘‘crap’’ and fell apart after a year and a half, because Trump: the Game sold poorly. In 2011, Time magazine listed the game as one of Trump’s top 10 business failures. 
IVANKA TRUMP CLOTHING  It’s not just Donald Trump who has a track record of overseas manufacturing. In Decem-ber, the New York Times, citing two trade databases, reported that ‘‘almost all’’ of Ivanka Trump’s clothing line is made over-seas. In May, New York-based activists were ar-rested in China while investigating the mak-ing of Ivanka Trump shoes. In July, the Washington Post traced Ivanka Trump prod-ucts to Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. More than 20 stores have dropped Ivanka Trump’s products since her father started his run for president. f 
POLL MISREPRESENTS THE ELECTORATE (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll states that only 36 percent of Ameri-cans approve the job President Trump is doing. But the results of this poll are flawed because it did not use a rep-resentative sample of Republican and Democratic participants. This Washington Post-ABC NEWS poll used a population sample that was 35 percent Democratic and only 23 per-cent Republican, underrepresenting Re-publican voters by about 10 percent. As noted by strategist Jim McLaughlin, ‘‘If the poll reflected the actual electorate, Trump would be in mid-40s, which is what his favorability rating was on election day when he won an overwhelming electoral college victory.’’ The same Washington Post pollsters gave Hillary Clinton a four-point ad-vantage over Donald Trump on the eve of the election. They consistently pre-dicted a significant Clinton victory, only to be proved wrong. Their credi-bility is questionable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H6029 July 19, 2017 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize this Friday as the 10th annual National Clinicians HIV/ AIDS Testing and Awareness Day. It is a harsh reality that HIV/AIDS touches every community across the country. Although we made great progress in treating the disease, it is imperative to continue striving for pre-vention, effective treatments, and a cure. This is particularly important in my home State of New Jersey. In 2013 alone, over 2,000 adults and adolescents were diagnosed with HIV, making New Jersey the sixth highest in the country of new diagnoses. In ages 13 to 24, diag-noses have increased from 10 to 18 per-cent, and in the African-American community, rates are above the na-tional average. We must remain vigilant to combat this epidemic that continues to plague communities across our Nation, espe-cially in light of the continued efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and remove insurance protections for mil-lions. We must be vocal against all ef-forts to take away the ability to re-ceive adequate care and do our part to fight HIV/AIDS. Encourage your loved ones to get tested.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S ACHIEVEMENTS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks President Donald Trump’s first 6 months in of-fice, and I appreciate his many suc-cesses for the American people. His leadership for jobs has inspired record highs today for the Dow, S&P 500, and NASDAQ. President Trump has advanced a decisive foreign policy posi-tively addressing the Muslim world, upholding the United States commit-ment to NATO, and working with our allies for peace through strength. Addi-tionally, the President has taken firm action against rogue regimes. In Syria, President Trump was clear that America will not tolerate chem-ical weapons attacks by the Assad re-gime against his citizens. In North Korea, the President has made clear that he will challenge the continued provocation by the communist, totali-tarian regime; and that the U.S. will expose Iran for their ballistic missile testing and human rights abuses. As of June 30, the House has passed 269 bills, the most of the last five ad-ministrations, with 37 laws signed to date, the most of the last five adminis-trations. I look forward to continuing to work with President Donald Trump and Vice President M
IKE PENCE for positive achievements to promote American families. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. RECOGNIZING CAROLYN WHITAKER-TANDY (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, 11 years ago, I set off on a long-shot cam-paign run by a talented and passionate but also overworked and inexperienced staff, many of whom were learning on the job. Yet everything went pretty smoothly—smoothly enough, obvi-ously. A big reason for this was an unpaid volunteer who just seemed to know how to do everything. She would show up with a warm, ever-present smile, eager to tackle the smallest task or take on the most challenging responsi-bility. Whatever was needed, Carolyn Whitaker-Tandy made everything easi-er. When it was time to hire a district director, Carolyn made that decision easy, too. I am fortunate to have had my friend Carolyn running my Louisville office since day one. Though I will miss her leadership, I am proud that she is mov-ing on to new opportunities. I know the people of Louisville are better off be-cause of her service. I saw it firsthand every day for more than a decade. For all she accomplished, her com-mitment, and her continued friendship, I am forever grateful. I expect great things from Carolyn and her amazing family, and I wish them nothing but the best going forward. f 
TURKISH TYRANT NOT WELCOME IN UNITED STATES (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I was joined by some Members of Congress, along with other Americans, in taking a stand for the First Amend-ment right of freedom of expression. We stood across the street from the Turkish Embassy, where, a few weeks ago, Turkish President Erdogan was visiting. But while a peaceful protest was taking place in May, Dictator Erdogan’s security detail crossed the street and assaulted and beat up U.S. citizens protesting the rogue regime. People were injured. The outlaws es-caped arrest and fled to Turkey. No apology was issued by the Turks, but, rather, the government justified the assault on Americans. Erdogan should not be welcome back into the United States until he apologizes. Also, the culprits must face justice in American courts. The First Amendment right of free-dom of expression is the First Amend-ment because it is the most important of all of our rights. No foreign tyrant can assault the First Amendment or assault Americans without con-sequences. This should never occur on our soil. And that is just the way it is. CONGRATULATING THE YOUNG GUNS AT QUAIL CREEK (Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute.) Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late the Young Guns at Quail Creek for winning the 2017 Scholastic Clay Tar-get Program National Championship. Based out of my hometown, Okee-chobee, Florida, the Young Guns have won the SCTP State championship for the past 3 years. The Young Guns had the highest combined team score of all 38 teams competing. Specifically, one partici-pant, Nicholas Blenker, had the high-est overall score in the competition for trap, skeet, and sporting clays. Over the course of the 2-day competition, Nicholas shot 575 out of 600, only miss-ing 25 shots. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the whole team on their success and for making Okeechobee proud. f 
FINI PROGRAM SHOULD BE REAU-THORIZED IN NEXT FARM BILL (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Nutri-tion Subcommittee, I rise today to speak about an important program that gives SNAP participants access to more fruits and vegetables. SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, helps provide low- income families with the resources they need to consume more nutritious food. The Agriculture Act of 2014 cre-ated the Food Insecurity Nutrition In-centive program, or FINI, which pro-vided $100 million to support produce incentive programs around the country for SNAP participants. This means SNAP benefits could be used at farmers’ markets, grocery stores, and other farmer-to-consumer retailers serving rural and urban com-munities. Mr. Speaker, the FINI program is successful in achieving the established goal of encouraging SNAP households to consume fresh, healthy produce. More than 74 percent of shoppers re-ported that they were eating more produce. As the Agriculture Committee works to develop the next farm bill, I know the FINI program should be reauthor-ized. The benefits of this program are twofold: it supports local American farmers and provides more Americans with quality food. That is what I call made in America.

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Middletown Township’s two newest police officers: Officer Kassidy Grove and Officer Ryan Morrison. Officers Grove and Morrison, both 23 years old, were sworn in by the Middle-town Township Board of Supervisors this week. Kassidy Grove is a graduate of Pennsbury High School and attended Lock Haven University where she played rugby. She went on to work at the Lehigh County Sheriff’s Office and for the Yardley Borough Police Depart-ment. Ryan Morrison graduated from Neshaminy High School, after which he enlisted as a military police officer. He recently graduated from the Temple University Police Academy. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Kassidy Grove and Ryan Morrison joining the police department of my hometown, Middletown Township, we recognize the larger commitment of all law en-forcement to step up and serve their communities. Mr. Speaker, I stand in solidarity with my brothers and sisters of the thin blue line, and I urge all Americans to honor their sacrifice. Together, let us recommit ourselves to the daily ideals and laws that Officers Grove and Morrison and so many others are sworn to uphold.

HONORING THE LIFE OF NADADUR VARDHAN  
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my good friend of 30 years, Nadadur Vardhan, a leader in the Indian-American commu-nity, who passed away on July 3 of this year at age 70 in Los Angeles, sur-rounded by his extended family. Nadadur Vardhan was born in India and immigrated to the United States in 1978. Arriving in America with just the clothes on his back, he poured his en-ergy into building a career as an inter-national tax consultant. Over four dec-ades, he grew his Santa Monica-based accounting practice to a thriving firm. Nadadur served as President of the Malibu Hindu Temple, one of the larg-est Hindu temples in the United States, and invited me to speak there and to be there on many occasions. As president of the temple, he was regularly invited to speak to political, cultural, and reli-gious groups across the world. Nadadur also founded the Indo-American Vision Foundation, a pioneering independent think tank that empowered Indian- American political activism. For his work in promoting the Indo- American community, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. A pas-sionate community leader, he person-ally met with many U.S. Presidents, Prime Ministers of India, and other elected officials. Nadadur was respon-sible for organizing several major cul-tural and political events, many of which I was honored to attend, includ-ing the World Hindu Economic Forum, forums with Indian Ambassadors to the United States, and events with a wide range of public figures. Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of my col-leagues join me in honoring his many contributions to our Nation and to ex-tend condolences to his wife, Dr. Indubala Nadadur Vardhan; his daugh-ters, Dr. Malini Nadadur and Anjani Nadadur; his brother, Nadadur Kumar; his sisters, Dr. Pushpa Kasturi and Alamelu Krishnamachary; his extended family; and to all whose lives he touched. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. SHERMAN for his comments. And again, the Progressive Caucus Special- Order hour tonight is on the subject of the police power in America, and its uses, its abuses, what has been taking place in different parts of the country, and we are going to kick off with K
EITH E
LLISON , who has been the chair of the Progressive Caucus. And in addition to being a distinguished member of the Congress from Minnesota, he is the vice chairman of the Democratic Na-tional Committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. E
LLISON ). Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I do ap-preciate the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to talk about a tragic situation involving Justine Damond. Justine Damond was a young woman who saw what she believed to be a sexual as-sault outside of her home. She then made a call to the police and asked them to come to give assistance. Ms. Damond then went outside to try to meet with the police to report what she saw, and for some reason, which no one really knows quite yet, she was shot in the abdomen and died. Ms. Damond, 40 years old, she was due to be married in only a few weeks. She leaves behind a fiance, her fiance’s son, her family, her parents, and here we are again dealing with a tragic situ-ation in which an unarmed civilian has been shot by a member of law enforce-ment. Now, as I speak today, Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear. I know many po-lice officers personally. I know how hard they work. I know the dangers that they incur. I know that they, by and large, join the force because they want to help people, because they are courageous and brave and are willing to put themselves in harm’s way in order to protect other citizens. And I myself, and many people I know, have called on the police to stop crimes from happening, to report them, and we are grateful when they report. But it is also true, Mr. Speaker, that officer-involved shootings happen with tremendous frequency, and it is not even a matter of blaming the officer. We have to ask ourselves what is going on with the system of policing which allows us to return to this tragic sce-nario again and again and again. Justine Damond, again, was report-edly in her pajamas, and she was trying to help another person, yet somehow the officer, who was on the passenger side of the squad car, shot through the door or the window, and that is not clear, and she sustained lethal injuries. One of the most disturbing things about this particular case, Mr. Speak-er, is that the officer’s body cameras were not turned on. The dash cam did not capture the interaction between Justine and the officers, and the body cams were, again, as I mentioned, not on. This is despite the fact that all Minneapolis police officers have worn body cameras since the end of 2016. Why the body cameras were not on, we can only speculate. But I urge, with everything I have, that the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Minneapolis Police De-partment, and everyone and anyone who has jurisdictional authority inves-tigate the reason for these tools to not be in use. Justine is dead. Justine is not com-ing back. And it is true that innocent people get killed by criminals all day, and that is a sad reality of our world. It doesn’t just happen in my city of Minneapolis. It happens all over the country. It happens all over the globe. But I think that citizens expect that members of law enforcement, who are sworn to protect us, would take due care to protect life, not end it, unless there was a legal basis to do so. Now, again, I don’t know what hap-pened here. Nobody really knows what caused the officer to somehow reach over his partner and shoot Ms. Damond in the abdomen and kill her when she is unarmed and wearing pajamas and is the reporter of a crime. The weeks and days ahead will reveal what happened. But I assure you that this will not be the last time that it happens unless, as a society, we begin to ask ourselves why these things are happening. In our community in Minnesota, we are still trying to figure out how to

deal with it, how to cope with the death of Philando Castile. Philando Castile was shot and killed on video-tape, captured on live-stream Facebook. To the credit of John Choi, who was the prosecutor, district attor-ney in Ramsey County, Minnesota, that officer was charged with the criminal offense of manslaughter, and after a jury trial, that officer was ac-quitted. When I looked at the dash cam and saw the officer discharge his firearm into the body of Philando Castile, it was absolutely horrifying, and I couldn’t possibly understand why this happened. I don’t know what the jurors saw, and I am a lawyer myself, and I support the jury system, but I can tell you that Philando Castile, who did have a firearm, said: Officer, I have a firearm; I have a license to carry a fire-arm. And the next thing you know, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, young man dead. Philando Castile was a beloved mem-ber of his community. He was the lunch attendant. He was the lunch manager at Hill Elementary School in St. Paul, and the children needed coun-seling, and the families needed some-body to explain why was Philando Cas-tile shot this way. The children are raised to respect the police, but they knew Philando Castile and they loved him, and they couldn’t reconcile why the police, who they re-spect, would hurt Philando Castile, who they also respected and admired and loved. Jamar Clark, another one from Min-nesota, unarmed, shot, killed, tremen-dous outpouring of community frustra-tion around this, brought an 18-day protest outside of the Fourth Precinct in Minneapolis, and you know, drew the attention of the entire community. And I can assure you that many people, particularly young people, were angry, upset, frustrated, feeling very vulner-able because they just felt that there was no accountability in that their lives just didn’t matter very much in the eyes of the people who were sworn to protect and defend them. We have a community problem, Mr. Speaker. We have to come together and deal with it, and it is simply not enough to say it is all the cops’ fault or it is all the citizens’ fault. This is a so-cial problem that calls for a social so-lution. Part of it will be changes in law. Part of it will be departmental changes. Part of it will be changes in the way we do business. But we have got to have these changes. And if people just say, ‘‘It is not my fault, you know, it was an accident, this person had it com-ing,’’ we will never get to the bottom of these kind of things. Mr. Speaker, in 1967, there were a state of civil disturbances, some people call riots, throughout our urban areas, and the government responded by issuing something called a Kerner Commission Report, K-E-R-N-E-R. And one of the findings of that is that po-lice community relations were incred-ibly bad, that communication was poor, and that the police were essen-tially sent into areas that were eco-nomically and socially isolated and de-prived in order to keep order, and what really should have been happening is that we should have been investing in jobs and opportunity and social inclu-sion, and we just asked the police to sort of just solve this problem without making the investments that our soci-ety should have made. b1830 I am sad to say that we really don’t seem to have advanced very far. The fact is that often civil disturbances, which are often referred to as riots, occur after these tragic shootings. Civil judgments are paid out. Citizens tend to distrust the police and are less willing to call them when they need them. There are tremendous social costs to not addressing these officer-involved shootings involving unarmed civilians, and we have to be there to do some-thing about it. We have seen a number of tragic cir-cumstances all across the country, whether it is Sandra Bland or whether it is Walter Scott in South Carolina, whether it is Eric Garner who died beg-ging for a breath or whether it is all of the victims of Officer Holtzclaw who routinely and systematically sexually abused women in Oklahoma City. The fact is there is great discretionary lati-tude conferred on our law enforcement officers. We need more oversight and account-ability. We need people to be held ac-countable when they break the law, and I mean people who are police and people who are not. We need to say that there is one standard of justice and that everyone has to adhere to it. We know about Michael Brown, 17 years old, shot in 2014, or we could say Tamir Rice. There are so many cases. They just go on and on and on. We are at a point where we have to address this crisis. Now, Ms. Damond is one of more than 500 fatal shootings by police this year alone. I will say it again, Mr. Speaker. Ms. Damond is one of more than 500 people who have been fatally killed by the police this year. Some of them, the officer may have had legal justification, some not; but when you have got 500 people across this country being shot and killed, it is a crisis that we have to do something about. This year, I could simply tell you, Mr. Speaker, that offering prayers sim-ply isn’t going to get it done. We have a systemic problem, and whether we have to talk about addressing body cameras more and insisting upon their use or whether we need implicit bias training for police to raise awareness of unconscious or implicit biases, whether we need to train officers on the deescalation of force and have training in that regard and, yes, pros-ecutions of people who just commit crimes with a uniform on, we have got to take decisive action. We need more diversity in police de-partments, and we need more diversity in jury selection. We need grand jury reform, and we need the Department of Justice to keep account of all the cases that involve officer-involved shootings. One thing we absolutely do not need is for the Attorney General, Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, to abandon con-sent decrees, which have brought some level of understanding and communica-tion between communities and the po-lice departments. We need a partner in the Federal Government, Mr. Speaker. What is at stake is too important. We also need quality schools. We need investment in neighborhoods. We need quality jobs and affordable hous-ing. We need healthcare for all, and we need to have clean air and water for ev-eryone. We need those things as part of the ecosystem that human beings live in. But none of these things are a re-placement for decent, respectful treat-ment people deserve from law enforce-ment. I am not here to give up. I am here to engage police in a dialogue about how we reduce these shootings, how we in-crease the trust, how we make sure that no one feels that they can’t go to the police because the trust has been so severely damaged. I believe we have got to come to-gether as a society and recognize that this problem is serious. It is not get-ting better; in fact, it is getting worse. When you think about cases involv-ing people like Mya Hall, or Alexa Christian, Meagan Hockaday, Sandra Bland, Natasha McKenna, all African- American women killed by or after en-counters with the police, it is not just men; it is women, too. It is not just Af-rican Americans; it is whites, too. Jus-tine Damond was a white female. It is Latinos. It is people of different eco-nomic stations. It is not just one com-munity. If Ms. Damond’s case proves anything, it is that officer-involved shootings of unarmed civilians don’t only occur in certain neighborhoods of certain people. The time is now for us to act. And I do put out a call for police and commu-nities to engage in an intensive discus-sion about how we restore trust, how we increase accountability, and how we really make it true when we write on the side doors of our police vehicles all across this country, ‘‘to protect and serve.’’ Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. E
LLISON very much for those very thoughtful and insightful comments. I want to pick up the discussion about the police power and expand the discussion to include not just power over persons, but power over property in America. Our Constitution’s Framers were deeply informed by the social contract theorists of the 17th and 18th centuries, and those theorists believed that we enter into a social contract out of a state of nature, because we are all

made better off by virtue of being part of a society. So the first incarnation of it came from Thomas Hobbes in his work on the ‘‘Leviathan.’’ Hobbes argued that the state of nature was, in his famous words, ‘‘nasty, brutish, and short,’’ be-cause anybody could kill anybody. And so we enter into society together, and we give our power to the leviathan, the government. Now, the problem with his view, of course, was that the leviathan, the government, had whatever powers it wanted, unlimited, infinite powers. And at that point, as the Framers of our Constitution would see, you have got a real problem, because you might be saved from criminals and bandits and thieves, but now you have got to deal with an all-powerful government and police who can trample your rights just as much as the thieves and the bandits could. So the Hobbesian theory was inadequate. John Locke, in his famous work on the social contract, improved upon the proposition. The state of nature for him was not quite so frightful a place. There were certain virtues to a state of nature, so people were actually giving something up by going into it. So in his view, entering the social contract meant that we would sur-render some of our powers to govern-ment, and certainly our powers to com-mit violence and theft against other people, but in return, we would be guaranteed rights by the government and we would also have rights against the government, and that was the view that deeply informed the U.S. Con-stitution. The whole point of the rule of law is that the people have rights against the government, against those who are just the agents of the sovereign. The sov-ereign is the people. The people are the sleeping sovereign who can come awake in times of constitution-making and also in order to make law. Now, the whole social contract be-comes unraveled Hobbesian style if we are attacked by the police. So my friend, Congressman P
OEfrom Texas, earlier spoke about the horrific spec-tacle of violence waged against U.S. citizens and others in the streets of Washington, D.C., by the thugs of Prime Minister Erdogan from Turkey, who were unleashed on protesters, and we saw, as Congressman P
OEsaid, a scene of really savage violence take place right here in Washington. I am glad that we have a bipartisan consensus that that kind of police at-tack on freedom of expression, freedom of assembly is unacceptable in the United States of America, whether it is on citizens or whether it is on perma-nent residents or whether it is on non-citizens. But there is something else that is going on in the country having to do with the police power. The police power in common law terms, in the American vernacular, is not just the power that police officers have to regulate public safety and public order; the police power also has to do generally with the governmental power to regulate. There are some very troubling things that are taking place in America today. One of them has to do with the eminent domain power. We are seeing rampant abuse of the eminent domain power across the country today, where private developers use their political power and influence in campaign con-tributions in order to get local govern-ments or State governments to con-demn private property of homeowners in order to oust them from their homes in order to build a private project. Now, one of the chief perpetrators of this business model in the United States of America happens to be the President of the United States, Donald Trump, who has bragged about his use of the eminent domain power and has been involved in a lot of litigation re-lating to eminent domain power. I will take you to Atlantic City and introduce you to a woman named Vera Coking, who lived in a three-story house off of the Boardwalk in Atlantic City right next door to the 22-story Trump Plaza that then-businessman Donald Trump had built. Trump had built the hotel; he built the casino; he built a parking garage. But it wasn’t enough for him. He wanted a VIP park-ing garage. He wanted a parking garage for limos and made an offer, which Ms. Coking refused, on her house so he could de-molish her house and build his ex-panded garage. She said: No, thank you. He came back with another offer. She said: No, thank you. It is not a ques-tion of money. My family has lived in this house for generations, and my kids went to school here, and we belong to the church here. It is not for sale. Well, then at that point, President Trump, in order to build his gold-plat-ed parking garage for the limos, went to a government agency that he knew well called the Atlantic City Casino Redevelopment Authority to help him take away Ms. Coking’s property, and they entered into litigation. Fortu-nately, she found pro bono counsel in the Libertarian public interest group, the Institute for Justice, a Libertarian think tank and legal action center, and they were able to stop Donald Trump in court in a case called Atlantic City Community Redevelopment Authority v. Banin. Unfortunately, that took place before the famous Kelo v. New London decision in 2005. Now, there was a very similar sce-nario in Kelo, in a hard-hit working- class town in Connecticut called New London, where the Pfizer Corporation and a local private land redevelopment authority, one of these shadowy, mixed public-private entities, decided that they wanted to displace a whole neigh-borhood in New London so they could destroy the blight, as they called it, and put in their brand-new develop-ment. Ms. Kelo, a very soft-spoken single woman, working-class woman, decided to fight, and she also found the Insti-tute for Justice, and they organized the community to say, no, they were not blight, that they had ties to this community and they were not going to be forced out by these big corporations. They won all the way up to the Su-preme Court, and then a five-Justice majority in the Supreme Court, in the Kelo decision in 2005, determined that it is perfectly constitutional and con-sistent with the Takings Clause in the Fifth Amendment of our Constitution for a public municipal corporation to condemn a person’s private home or a private small business in order to turn it over to another private business if it is consistent with someone’s economic redevelopment plan. And this was a de-cision that President Trump said he ‘‘agrees with 100 percent.’’ Because, remember, that was his business model, that everything is for sale, and if you refuse to sell to Donald Trump and his companies, they are just going to get public authority to come in to get you out of the way so they can condemn your land and take it over. Now, it turns out that in the Kelo de-cision, after the Supreme Court’s erro-neous judgment in it, the land was con-demned, Susette Kelo was forced out of her house, and—guess what—they never even built it. Today it is an urban wilderness taken over by wild cats. b1845 Well, let’s look at another example of abuse of police power in America today. I understand that earlier this morn-ing, the Justice Department announced a new Federal policy to help State and local police officers take cash and property from anybody suspected of a crime even without arresting them, even without charging them with a crime, and even without an arrest war-rant, reversing an Obama administra-tion rule that was put in place because of rampant abuse of people’s rights across the country. This is the United States of America. The police should not be able to stop people on the street, in their cars, or at their homes and say: I think that the money you have doesn’t really belong to you. I think the condo you have doesn’t belong to you. I think the car you have doesn’t belong to you. I think your property looks suspect. We are going to seize it. And then we are going to hold it, and you have the burden of coming to sue us to prove that your property is innocent—without charging them with a crime, without arresting them, or without using a search war-rant. This is what Attorney General Sessions wants to do with the Orwell-ian new order that he handed down today. He wants to get the Federal Government back into the business of working with State and local govern-ments to simply declare people’s prop-erty and their money presumptively guilty. And then they have to go out,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H6033 July 19, 2017 
hire a lawyer, and go to court to prove that their property or money is clean within the eyes of the government. But whatever happened to due proc-ess? Under our Constitution, we are presumed to be innocent of crimes, and our property should be presumed to be innocent of crimes if there is no legal process at all to condemn our property or to cast a shadow of criminal sus-picion over it. If you look at the history of this, At-torney General Holder barred State and local police from using the Federal legal regime to seize cash and other property without criminal charges or without criminal warrants, which is the right way to do it. That is the con-stitutional way to think about it. In a democratic society, the people are presumed to be innocent until they are proven guilty. It is not as if we are walking around with the stigma of being presumed guilty of doing some-thing in the eyes of the State. Since 2008, thousands of police agen-cies have made more than 55,000 sei-zures of cash and property worth $3 bil-lion under a Justice Department civil asset forfeiture program, which al-lowed the police to make seizures and then share the proceeds with Federal agencies. It allowed the Federal agen-cies to cooperate with State and local law enforcement. Then the Department of Justice said they were disengaging from that be-cause there was a series in The Wash-ington Post about all of the extraor-dinary abuses taking place. There was one gentleman, a small business man, a Chinese-American cit-izen of the United States who was trav-eling with a lot of money because he was going to purchase a building for his new Chinese restaurant that he was going to open up, and so he had, I think it was around $25,000 or $30,000 with him. He got stopped by the police and he was exceedingly nervous about the whole thing. They said he was acting nervous and they took his money from him, his life savings that he was hang-ing on to in order to go and purchase a building for a Chinese restaurant. Luckily, he found some lawyers, but it took several years for him to get the money back. He lost the deal. He is in the minority because most people this happens to never go to court to try to get their money back, they are so terrified and demoralized by the experience of having their prop-erty taken by government agents with-out any due process at all. I urge everyone to go and find that Washington Post series on the abuses that led up to the change in policy that was put into place by Attorney General Eric Holder. Now, Attorney General Sessions does a U-turn. The administration, which President Trump started by saying he wanted to give power back to the States and back to the people of the United States, instead says the Federal Government is going to be incentivizing more violation of people’s due process rights by allowing seizure of people’s property and money. It goes back to what Congressman E
LLISON was talking about: What is this going to do for police-civilian rela-tions in the United States, when people are terrified that their property can be taken away by agents of the State without an arrest, without a criminal warrant, or without any charges at all? That is not right in our country. That is not right in a country that does not allow for a taking of private property without a public purpose. It is not right in a country that is based on due process of law, that is based on prob-able cause and search warrants for peo-ple being searched. That is where this administration is taking us with the policy that was an-nounced earlier today. It is going to make our communities only more sus-picious and only more dangerous. We have to step back from this Or-wellian leviathan vision of govern-ment, an all-powerful State that can seize your home or your small business because a big business man like Donald Trump wants your property to build his casino garage for his VIP guests; or because some fancy company decides it wants to redevelop your land; or be-cause the police decide you don’t look the right way and we are just going to take your money out of your pocket, we are going to seize what is in your wallet, we are going to take your car, we are going to take your boat, or we are going to take your condo or apart-ment without any criminal charges at all, and you go and deal with the prob-lem. Mr. Speaker, in the United States of America, we are a land of laws. The great Tom Paine said that, in the mon-archies, the king is law, but in the de-mocracies, the law is king. We have to abide by the rule of law here. And I am not talking about Dem-ocrat, Republican, left, or right. We all have to be constitutional patriots in America, to stand up for our Constitu-tion. I would invite the President of the United States to come join us here to talk about the problem of eminent do-main abuse and to talk about the prob-lem of law enforcement taking people’s property and their money without due process of law, because it is a serious threat to everything that we believe in and why we created our social con-tract. All of us have got to be constitu-tional patriots and stand up for the basic principles of the country. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
f 
AMERICA’S DEBT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentleman from Ari-zona (Mr. S
CHWEIKERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Indiana (Mr. H
OLLINGSWORTH ). COSTLY AND BURDENSOME REGULATIONS  
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arizona for yielding to me. I promise to be brief. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about something that Hoosiers back home are talking to me about every single day, and that is to rise to ex-press my support for those struggling against burdensome and costly regula-tions, those costly regulations that are hurting Hoosier businesses from being able to get their products to market, from ultimately being able to grow their enterprises, and from ultimately being able to hire more Hoosiers. When Democrats passed the Dodd- Frank Act, they promised a success for Main Street. Instead, Dodd-Frank has become a nightmare for businesses on Main Street. Specifically, while I was back home just a few weeks ago, I met with two businesses working hard to do right by their customers and employees but confounded by section 1502 of the Dodd- Frank Act. Section 1502 requires businesses to disclose due diligence on the source and chain of custody of ‘‘conflict min-erals,’’ as well as hire a third party to honor their due diligence and subse-quently submit a report to the SEC on those measures. According to its Democratic authors, this provision would only affect the biggest of compa-nies, but those companies have to bring in all of their suppliers, all of their vendors in order to comply, which af-fects many small businesses across In-diana’s Ninth District. One of those firms is Best Home Fur-nishings in Paoli. They manufacture quality furniture across Indiana, and I was astounded to learn the lengths they must go through in order to com-ply with this regulation. They travel far abroad to verify the wood is con-flict-free. And even after all that time- consuming and very costly travel, they are left wondering, despite all of their best efforts, if they are making any im-pact on those areas that are far from their plants, far from their customers, and far from their employees. Another such example is Key Elec-tronics, a manufacturer that is work-ing on electronics in Indiana to get through opioid withdrawals for many Hoosiers who are afflicted by this scourge on our communities. It is a laudable goal, but they are hamstrung by the thousands and thousands of dol-lars they pay to ensure the customers that they work with ultimately get this third-party audit on them and all of their vendors. This challenging busi-ness with very thin margins is being limited in what they can invest in in-novative, desperately needed therapy for those addicted to opioids. For every dollar and every moment that a businessowner has to spend com-plying with this outrageous and unnec-essary regulation, those are minutes and dollars that are not directed to-wards job creation, not directed to-wards investing in America’s future,

and not directed towards fulfilling their and, ultimately, their employees’ dreams. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to work-ing with my colleagues in this Con-gress to bring an end to the excessive job-killing regulations that stand be-tween Hoosiers and their entrepre-neurial dreams. 
GIVE AMERICANS BACK THEIR HEALTHCARE  
SYSTEM  
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about how regula-tions and restrictions in healthcare space are preventing new innovations from being able to deliver better care to Hoosiers back home. I recently met with a local business just outside of my district, Mainstreet Health Investments, who is working hard to develop new rapid recovery centers that are truly better in match-ing patients’ needs with services pro-vided. For example, when a patient has knee surgery, they only need a hospital for a very limited window during their period of acute care. They need that hospital for such immediate recovery, but, hours after that, they can be transferred to a different recovery cen-ter, one that better matches their needs as a patient, enabling them to re-cover much more quickly and enabling us all to save significant dollars by matching that care with the needs that they have. Frankly, I have been amazed at the quality of these rapid recovery centers, where the patient is truly focused on, in a holistic manner, such that they can develop and have physical therapy right there in that location. It is inno-vations just like these rapid recovery centers that they are building that will help deliver better cures to more Americans. This is how we make a healthcare system that is not only more afford-able, not only more accessible, but also better for patients in the long run. I want it to be just as effective, in addi-tion to affordable and accessible. What stands in the way? What is standing in their way is certainly gov-ernment bureaucracy, a government that is retarding a level of innovation, retarding their ability to grow and build more of these facilities across the country despite the demonstrated need and the demonstrated benefit to those patients. So I wanted to talk about those regu-lations and how they stand in the way of Americans and Hoosiers who are try-ing to get ahead, trying to get their companies get ahead, trying to help their fellow employees get ahead, and, ultimately, that will, together, help America get ahead. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons for taking this time— and it was only about 3 weeks ago we actually took the leadership hour and we did a series of presentations on what was happening in debt and the ex-cessive spending in the Federal Govern-ment, what was driving it and what was happening with mandatory spend-ing. Then the very next morning, CBO issued an update. Have you ever had one of those mo-ments in your life where you just spent almost an hour on the floor walking through the numbers, and you get a document and you start digging into it, and you find out a number of the things you presented just 14 hours ear-lier were wrong? But, sadly, they were wrong in the wrong direction, if there is such a way to phrase it. Think of this: From January’s Con-gressional Budget Office number until June’s number, the U.S. debt deficit this year, the U.S. deficit this year, grew by $134 billion as our projection for the end of the year. So, function-ally, the deficit for 2017, the fiscal year we are in, we will come very close to $700 billion this year. b1900 It is going to be 693 is the projection. And if anyone saw—I think it was yes-terday or the day before—Mick Mulvaney over at OMB, was projecting, from the White House’s calculations, that the deficit this year was going to be about $704 billion. So we put together this slide next to me just to make it clear how much that is, to just sort of understand what is going on and trying to put this in perspective. Okay. So we are going to use the CBO number because, you know, it is the Congressional Budget Office. So $693 billion is going to be borrowed for 2017, the year we are in right now. Well, think about that. That is $1.89 billion every single day. That is $79 million every hour; $1.3 million every minute. And, what, $1,900 every second? And that is what we are borrowing. So if I take up an hour here, you all get to make a decision if my hour here was worth $79 million of borrowing. Why is this sort of devastating in the numbers when you really start to dig into this CBO report? Well, first let me give you one of the things that bothered me the most. This is a big deal when, from January to June, our excessive spending and bor-rowing number actually increases by 25 percent and it got almost zero press. We are living in a society right now where, if there is a shiny object, a tweet, another story, the press, even a lot of the Members of this body, run talk about that. And I will make you the argument that the greatest sys-temic threat to this society are these numbers because the fact we are going to borrow $134 billion more than we were already projecting, it is worse than that. If you were to step back 1 year ago, 1 year ago we thought this year’s def-icit was going to be about $450 billion. I mean, it is still outrageous. In a year’s time that number now is kissing up to $700 billion this year. To understand the scale of that, we are going to actually do some of our slides. And the first one we are going to put up is the slide from 3 weeks ago, and the punch line on it is the numbers are worse than this. I just wasn’t going to use up a whole bunch of ink and print a new one. But this is important to understand. So this is where we think we are going. This is what is in the CBO re-port. But do you see actually the blue areas? That is sort of spending that is on autopilot. When we say autopilot, it is by formula. You reach a certain age, you get certain benefits. You fall below a certain income, you get certain bene-fits. We borrow money, we pay back the interest. You have served honor-ably in the military, you qualify for certain benefits. But this is 2026, so this is function-ally 9 budget years from now. Under-stand where we will be. Social Secu-rity, Medicare, Medicaid, other things that are formula driven, you fall below a certain income, you get interest on the debt. And you start to realize only 22 per-cent of all spending in 9 years will be things that functionally get voted on here. Everything else will be by for-mula. Your government is very quickly becoming a health insurer with an army, an insurance company with an army. What is fascinating is—think about this—this year we are going to kiss up close to $700 billion in borrowing. That is more than all discretionary spending on nonmilitary discretionary spending. So think about that. If you came to me and said, ‘‘David, I want you to only spend exactly what you are taking in right now,’’ you get to help me make a decision. If I am not allowed to touch mandatory spending, the entitlements, do you remove the entire military, or do you remove everything else you think of as government, the Park Serv-ice, the FDA, the FBI? Everything else is government be-cause all of that is living on borrowed money. And somehow we desperately must find a way for the American pub-lic to understand the scale and how quickly these numbers are moving away from us. In 5 years, so those folks who are 60 years old today, they are at the peak of what we call the ‘‘Baby Boom.’’ So in 5 years from now, we actually hit the peak of our brothers and sisters who will receive their retirement benefits, if they take them at 65. And you start to look at the numbers. And we are going to—let’s switch to the next slide. And you will actually start to see that curve steepening. We are going to show a slide in a cou-ple of boards from here that starts to show you at what point we are running these trillion-dollar deficits. The next point I also wanted to make that was here in the CBO report is, when we borrow an additional $134 bil-lion on top of what we already pro-jected—so close to $700 billion this year—that is now part of the rolling debt. That is part of—now we are going to be paying interest on that for gen-erations because our inflection point to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H6035 July 19, 2017 
pay down the debt is moving farther away from us every day because—you saw the previous slide—every day we are borrowing pretty close to $1.9 bil-lion every single day. So why this slide is important is— just understand—in 9 budget years, if you said, ‘‘David, I want you to deal with the debt. I don’t want you to do it today because I don’t want to lose any benefits. I don’t want to talk about the complications of what happens if we had to deal with the reality of trying to make the combination of making the economy grow and having to deal with entitlement reform,’’ but in 9 years, only 11 percent of the budget would be nondefense, non-entitlement. And the amazing thing is, that num-ber will stay almost identical for the next 10 years. So almost all the growth, a trillion-plus dollars of growth in those 9 years is coming al-most solely from Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, interest on the debt, veterans’ benefits, but mostly Medi-care. It is really difficult to talk about, but if you actually look in the CBO numbers, you understand, we have a couple of our key trust funds that start to run out of money within the 10-year window. So let’s actually switch slides and try to—and a couple of these are going to be repetitive for a point, so it starts to become more absorbable of what is actually really going on in these underlying numbers. So we put this one together just to sort of have a sense of what has hap-pened. What happened from when we were estimating in 2016, the Congres-sional Budget Office gave us a number, so this is a year ago. We were building our budgets. We were building our pro-jections. We were building our cost analysis on how much interest financ-ing, these things. This is a year ago. We thought we were going to borrow $544 billion, still an outrageous amount of money. Here we are a year later and we are going to come close to $700 billion. Then in January, from a year ago—so this last January—it moved up to, hey, we are going to borrow $559 billion. Not a lot of movement. And then 6 months later, it blows off the charts. And now all of a sudden, we know from the CBO number, it is $693 billion of borrowing this year. The OMB number, I know the chart over here I think is saying 702. I could swear I saw 704, but let’s just call it $700 billion. This is an intense frustration be-cause, if you actually listen to many of us as we get behind these mikes, we will argue and fight and fuss often on things that, when you actually add them up, are pretty small, sometimes bordering on petty, that don’t really have a multiplier effect into the fu-ture. Yet, how much discussion have you heard behind these microphones in the last 3 weeks, since the CBO report came out, the update came out that, hey, from January to June, somehow the number just grew by 25 percent; we just added another $134 billion of bor-rowing this year? This isn’t way off into the future. It is this year. And guess what. We are going to be financing that for as long as anyone who is probably watching this or listening to this in this room is alive. Can we go to the next slide. We are heading toward a time where the growth of this debt, the growth in man-datory spending is moving to crushing everything else we care about. So if you happen to be someone who is a Member of this body and you care pas-sionately about education, you must understand that the mandatory spend-ing is going to crush it. If you care about the environment and other programs, the finding re-sources to pay for those things is gone. If you care desperately about defense, defense is going to be competing for scarcer and scarcer dollars because those dollars are promised in our man-datory spending, our entitlements. So the only reason I threw this one up was just getting a sense that just the movement from January to June— the chart may not look like a big deal, but we are dealing with hundreds of billions of dollars here. You see that little separation be-tween the red line and the blue line? That separation is 6 months. This isn’t a game. It shouldn’t be partisan. The numbers are the numbers, and Congress cannot continue to exist in a math-free zone. So—and I am sorry. This is actu-ally—I have toned down my charts be-cause I was getting made fun of by making too many of them, and, actu-ally, I was. I think I killed one of the big printers here on Capitol Hill, but that is another discussion. So let’s actually sort of look at this one. This is functionally 2017 to 2027. So the 10-year window, which we use constantly around here. Just under-stand what this constant growth of the debt does in the mix of our priorities that we are able to pay for. Where is the money? Where does it ultimately come from? Where does it go? So if we are here right now, the first bar is spending. The second bar is reve-nues or pay-fors or mechanics. You know, some of it is borrowing, some of it is payroll taxes, and other things. Then the same thing for 2027. So let’s first take a look at where we are at right now, and this is by gross domestic product. So they tell me this is a much more elegant way to sort of understand how much of our society’s economy is going into finance govern-ment—is going into finance govern-ment’s debt. And none of these num-bers have State and local. This is just us at the Federal Government level. So take a look. This year, hey, about 1.4 percent of our GDP, of the economic muscle of our society is going into fi-nancing our excessive spending, our debt. In 10 years, it is 2.9 percent. So it is the entire economy, close to 3 per-cent of it is going to be grabbed just to pay for debt. But when you also start to look at— you see that black portion on the top? In 2017, the excessive spending here, without revenue—so it is borrowing—is 3.6 percent of our entire GDP went to borrowing. In 10 years, it is 5.2, and it keeps growing, and it really starts to take off. Remember we had the comment ‘‘in 5 years, we hit the peak of the Baby Boom moving into retirement.’’ And if you see the curve, it steepens and, over the next couple of decades, it blows off the charts. So you actually start to look at the mix of: What are our resources? What do we have? Well, let’s just go to the 2027. So that is this. So, functionally, 6 percent of our entire economy will be going to So-cial Security; 6.9 percent of our GDP will be going to healthcare programs. Another 2.5 percent of our society’s GDP will be going to other mandatory programs. Only 5.4 will be going to everything we call discretionary, and part of that is also defense. So about half of that will be defense and half of that will be other discretionary programs. b1915 This is where we are moving prioritywise. The growth of these pro-grams consume everything in their path. One of the things we actually talked about 3 weeks ago when we were behind this microphone—look, there are demo-graphic changes, but when I was a kid, $4 were spent for young people for every dollar that was spent for our, what we will call, seniors. Today, that is reversed. Today, we will spend $4 for seniors for every dollar spent for young people, and that curve continues to move away from us. So just under-stand, that is the decision this body, this society, has made as our priorities. Now, why this slide is so incredibly important to understand, if you see the blue there—and, look, I am blessed to be on the Social Security Committee in Ways and Means. We just had the ac-tuary report, and Social Security has problems, but it is not a crisis. It is fix-able. As a matter of fact, any well meaning people, a handful of them could get in a room and in a day fix the unfunded liabilities, which I think is 22, $24 trillion over the 75-year window for Social Security. What should terrify you are the num-bers I am about to point out that are actually within Medicare. Let’s actu-ally just sort of reach over here, and forgive me for leaning over. Let’s say you are 50 years old today. We are going to use 65 as the benchmark for retirement. You are going to be retir-ing in 2030. You see the gray here? Over your career, over your work life, the average person who will be retiring in 2030 will have put in $179,000 into Medi-care.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH6036 July 19, 2017 
But do you see this side? They are going to receive $621,000 in benefits. The person who is 60 years old today, in the average, and these are means, the person who is 60 today, retiring in 5 years, will have paid $179,000 in part of their FICA tax going to Medicare. Over their years of retirement, because of longevity, because of healthcare costs, because of a series of different things, they are going to take out $621,000. Now, I need you to start to multiply those types of differentials where we put in this, we are taking this out, and multiply it times 76 million of our brothers and sisters who we define as baby boomers. Do you see the math problem? This slide isn’t from some conserv-ative group. I believe it is from the Urban Institute. This is just reality. Let’s say you happen to be my most liberal constituent, and you care des-perately about the preservation of these entitlements and of Medicare. You should be the first one lining up with me and others around here from both sides of the aisle saying: We must do two key things. We must adopt poli-cies that maximize economic growth, because whether it be tax reform, whether it be regulatory reform, whether it be immigration reform, all these things, but primarily tax reform, we must do those policies that drive economic growth, because a growing economy solves a lot of problems, but it doesn’t come close to dealing with these types of shortfalls. So the second thing that must be done, and it is going to take fair-mind-ed people on both sides of the aisle, we are going to have to do entitlement re-form. It is just the math. When someone gets behind one of these microphones or is running for of-fice and they say, ‘‘Well, if we just get rid of waste and fraud, or if we just get rid of foreign aid, or if we just get rid of this,’’ I am sorry, they need to go out and invest in a calculator. That is not what the underlying numbers say. And to try to double down on a cou-ple of these points, to understand how fast these numbers are moving away from us, in 2022—it sounds like a long time from now, but, look, we are work-ing on the 2018 budget right now. So, what, four budget years from now? Every year, we are going to be running a $1 trillion deficit, and it grows and grows. That $1 trillion of borrowing in 2022 has to be financed. We are working on this chart. It is a little more complicated, so you are not going to see it for another month or so. As you are borrowing more money and interest rates go up, you do understand it is not just the money we are bor-rowing this year. When we move up the interest rates because we are out there in the markets sucking up the capital, pulling the capital in, when we raise interest rates, there are about $2.5 tril-lion of our $14-plus trillion of publicly held debt that is refinanced every year. So it is not just the interest we pay on new borrowing. Like, right now, almost $1.9 billion had to be borrowed today. It is not just the interest we are going to pay on that, but it is the effect on ev-erything that is refinanced every year, every day, every month, every quarter, because as those interest rates move up, we have to change the financing. Just understand, when you look at this chart just how fast—and this is just the borrowing number—how it ex-plodes away from us. So in 2027, 10 years from now, annual deficit, $1.463 trillion of just borrowing. That is 9 budget years from now. You realize, if you add that up, I be-lieve that is more than all military and all other discretionary spending we are spending today. Please understand how fast these numbers are moving away from us and start demanding that we, as Members of Congress, toughen up and do those things that are really dif-ficult, really hard, and the willingness to tell the truth of what is driving these debts and deficits. My primary reason for putting up this chart is that I am a huge fan that we have to do sort of this holistic ap-proach, that it is now incumbent upon us as policymakers to do everything and do everything at once. You can’t just have us say we need to do healthcare reform because almost no one in the country who is outside that world is paying attention to what it is doing to the debt and deficit, blowing them off the charts. Then we have those of us who are fo-cused right now on doing tax reform. We talk about our book of specialty, and people who care about immigra-tion, care about this, care about that. The reality is we have to do it all. We have to do it all at the same time to maximize economic growth. The GDP indicator today from the Atlanta Fed, we call it GDPNow—it is a wonderful website. It is a great app— I think has us at 2.5 percent GDP. Okay. That is better than we have been. The new CBO baseline built into this next 10-year projection is saying 1.9 percent GDP growth. That is unaccept-able because these numbers continue to remain incredibly ugly if we grow at that speed. But if we were to be at 3, 3.5, the numbers get much easier to deal with. But this chart is really im-portant and a little tough to absorb, but it basically demonstrates, even with additional growth, we are still going to have to do entitlement re-form, and it is going to have to be on a fairly large scale. Growth makes it just a lot easier and makes it so we can do a much longer onramp for our brothers and sisters who are right now planning for retire-ment or other benefit programs that are out there. So in this next slide, I wanted to show it because I wanted to actually use it to talk about—I know right now there is a lot of consternation of what is happening over in the Senate in re-gards to healthcare, and I think con-stantly there is a lot of misinformation about the healthcare bill we did here in the House, what I have read of what has been worked on in the Senate. So let’s first get a couple things very clear. If you hear a commentator, if you are someone behind one of these mics, talk about, ‘‘Well, it is one-sixth of the economy and that is what is in this bill,’’ they didn’t read the bill. The ACA replacement is almost ex-clusively about the small portion of our society that is in the individual market. They don’t get their healthcare from an employer. They don’t get their healthcare from Medi-care. They don’t get their healthcare from the VA. They don’t get their healthcare from Indian Health Service or TRICARE or all these other ways. They are the plumber. They are my wife and I when we were running our own business. In my congressional district, it is only 2 percent of my population. In my State, it is only 4 percent of my popu-lation. That was the population that was having great difficulties if they held a preexisting condition. Well, this society now, we have all come to terms, we are a guaranteed-issue soci-ety. That was in our bill when it passed. But that is still a tiny portion of the society that is in that individual market. In a State like mine, Arizona, you have a single choice, huge price hikes, and none of that was what was promised. When you start to look at the math on the deductibles and then the price, so many of our brothers and sisters out there who should be in that individual market are basically saying: I would rather pay the fine; let them try to catch me. Because we have already talked about them. We did a whole presentation, I think, about 6 weeks ago, 2 months ago, that were in this ratcheting problem. Half of our popu-lation who should be in that individual market, let’s just call them the healthy, 50 percent of that population who only use about 3 percent of the healthcare dollars, they basically said: It is too expensive; I am not buying. But every time someone who is a part of that healthy portion of the curve says ‘‘Yeah, you have mandatory purchase, but I am still not going to buy’’ and doesn’t purchase, you end up in this ratcheting effect. And the ratcheting effect, it gets more expen-sive, so more drop out; gets more ex-pensive, more drop out. And that has been the crisis that is the ACA. Most people know it as ObamaCare, but to be respectful, let’s call it the ACA. It has an actuarial, structural death spiral. So our attempt was: Could you do a series of things that would lower the premiums enough for that 50 per-cent of the population who only uses 3 percent of the healthcare dollars to get them to actually buy? Mandatory. Hasn’t worked. Maybe really well- priced coverage would work, because when they participate, the curve flat-tens out. Because right now, it looks like a hockey stick, and we know there

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H6037 July 19, 2017 
is functionally a tiny percent of our population, I think it is like 5 percent of the population, equals almost 50 per-cent of all the spending. So the reason this chart is up here, we were trying to find an elegant way to try to say those of us who, like my-self, I have fairly severe asthma, but folks with chronic conditions, diabetes, particularly if it is not managed, other things, that is actually 84 percent of all healthcare costs. When we did the risk-sharing amend-ment for the ACA replacement bill, we were trying to fixate on that con-tinuity of care. How do you finance that continuity of care for our brothers and sisters, particularly those who have those chronic conditions, to make sure that is continuity of care between themselves, their doctors, their healthcare institution, the insurer? I thought we did a fairly elegant job of drafting that and then putting real re-sources behind it. But this is important to understand, the outlier of our brothers and sisters out there, those of us who have pre-existing conditions or who have chron-ic conditions, end up being the cost drivers in our healthcare. So our ability to be creative, our ability to say: If you have one of those in your pocket, can this actually be part of your healthcare management? Are we going to accept the reality that someone with a chronic condition should be allowed to pick up their phone and use FaceTime to talk to their doctor? b1930 Should a poor person be allowed to use their phone to consult their doc-tor? Should they be allowed to wear sensors and other things? There are some incredibly creative things rolling onto the market there to help our brothers and sisters with chronic ill-ness. This body needs to be prepared to adopt them, because here is the punch line: whether it had been the ACA, whether it had been a replacement, had almost nothing actually to do with healthcare. It had to do with who pays. This was about the money: who pays, who gets the money. Because remember, it was in 1986—31 years ago—a piece of legislation was passed basically saying you cannot deny someone medical services. You show up to the emergency room, you show up in the hospital, you are get-ting your medical services, and you can actually see this in the data. For the last 30 years, the number of procedures, particularly the stuff it costs, has been laid much the same. So when you have people saying, ‘‘Oh, you are not going to be able to get healthcare,’’ we have been a society for 30-plus years that has sort of a guar-antee of delivery of health services. The great battle is who pays. Do you remember a few years ago when we had the great consternation of dispro share, uncompensated care. I worked on those issues. And now all of these years later, we are basically try-ing to make an argument of who pays, how do we pay, how do we get more healthy—that is 20-, 30-, 40-year-olds who are healthy, how do we get more of them, particularly in the individual markets, to participate? Then the second half is Medicaid. This is a strange city because it is one of those cities, when you actually look at the dollars, even though the dollars are going to continue to grow and grow and grow, so many people define that as a cut. But remember, we were look-ing at the exploding deficit debt num-bers. We have to deal with the reality. We are in real trouble, and we are going to have to step up and start being honest with each other about what is happening in the underlying math here. So I know this is a little diversion from what was in the CBO report, but once again, you saw on the charts that the healthcare and healthcare entitle-ment numbers were substantially driv-ing the deficits. Now you actually sort of see what is in the underlying part of that population. We will go back to the beginning again. Hopefully, I haven’t spoken for a whole hour, for your sake and mine. But one more time: this year, accord-ing to CBO, 3 weeks ago—and you have heard lots of talk about it, right? That was me being sarcastic—$193 billion of borrowing this year. We are going to borrow almost $1.9 billion every day, $79 million every hour. I have been here an hour. Has this been worth $79 mil-lion to you? But think about it—and I know I misspoke earlier, so that is one of the reasons I wanted to put this board up. It is $21,900, $21,900 every second of bor-rowing. I have a 21-month-old. It is the great-est gift the good Lord has ever given my wife and me. I pray for the birth mother every night, saying, ‘‘Thank you.’’ But if you look at the charts, when she hits her peak earning years, her tax rates are going to be double, maybe even more, of what I would pay today. The economic growth is probably crushed by the amount of debt; and a lot of the calculations, if we step out 30 years, the computers can’t even model them anymore. Because, understand, there are some amazing numbers in here that functionally, in 9 budget years, we are at 91 percent debt to GDP on publicly held debt. That is not the money we borrowed from the trust funds. So the question I ask—I love my lit-tle girl. How many of you love your kids? How many of you love your grandkids? How many of you love this country? How many of you want this country to have an amazing future, be-cause it can. This is all fixable. Just every single day we wait, we make it so much more difficult. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. B
UDD). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair rec-ognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G
ARRETT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my colleague, Congress-man S
CHWEIKERT from Arizona. I hadn’t intended to, but I will begin my remarks by addressing his remarks, and I will do something that I rarely do, and that is to quote a French histo-rian, political scientist, and diplomat, Alexis de Tocqueville, who stated: ‘‘The American Republic will endure until the day that Congress discovers that it can bribe the public with the public’s own money.’’ The previous administration was led by an individual who, on the campaign trail, said that $7 trillion in debt was unpatriotic. Now we sit at the preci-pice of $20 trillion after two terms, and I would submit that perhaps that is un-patriotic multiplied by three, or nearly that, and echo the sentiments of Mr. S
CHWEIKERT that it is absolutely, posi-tively unsustainable. Now, there are ways that we could certainly deal with runaway debt. One way would be to completely devalue the currency. If you really want to step away from the hyperbolic barbs that are thrown by my colleagues across the aisle as relate to the motives for the legislation that we carry and find out who would be really harming seniors and children, it would be those who would continue to spend until the only way to cover the tab was to deflate the value of the very moneys set aside to care for those least able to care for themselves. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman S
CHWEIKERT not only for his wise re-marks, but also for reminding me just how much I miss being a member of the statehouse in the Commonwealth of Virginia where there is actual back- and-forth debate on the merits of issues, wherein that small percentage of individuals who choose to inform themselves might shape their opinions based on a discourse rather than people standing at this microphone un-checked. That leads me to my next point, which is also not on the subject that I originally intended to address, and that is the statement of my distin-guished colleague from Maryland, Mr. R
ASKIN , who spoke on this floor about 45 minutes ago on a subject that is im-portant not just to him and not just to me, but to America, and that is on the subject of asset forfeiture. His comments were indicative of the tone that this body has devolved into. One of the many Democrats whom I ad-mire, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whom Vanity Fair described as a fervent Democrat who saw the value in work-ing with Republicans—where is he today?—he once said: You are entitled to your own opinions, but you are not entitled to your own facts. Mr. R
ASKIN said that the Trump ad-ministration was burdening Americans

by virtue of an asset forfeiture policy, and he cited the case of a Chinese res-taurant, an entrepreneur who he said had amassed $25,000 so that he could buy a building. But he was going over the speed limit so he was pulled over by police. So without cause, they took his money, and it took him 7 years, ac-cording to my colleague, to recoup his money and the opportunity was lost, and that is what is wrong with Mr. Trump’s policy. Wow. And he implored listeners to please look up this case, so I did. In fact, there was a man who had saved money to purchase a Chinese res-taurant who was going 10 miles an hour over the speed limit. He was pulled over by law enforcement, and he had not $25,000, but $75,000 forfeited. It took him not 7 years, but 10 months to get it back, and it happened in 2014. I am not terribly sure who was President then, but I don’t think it was Donald Trump. So I will join my colleague in sug-gesting that we need asset forfeiture review and reform in this country. But, please, you are entitled to your own opinions; you are not entitled to your own facts. Now, why am I here tonight? Golly, Ned, why am I here at all? Who are we as a nation? I tell my children, if you want to know what is the right thing to do in life when you are confronted with tough challenges, when you have a di-lemma, ask yourself, ‘‘Who do I want to be?’’ Not ‘‘Who am I?’’ ‘‘Who do I want to be?’’ Because I hope I never reach my aspi-rational goals, but I keep trying as long as I am here. I don’t think if you reach all of your goals for who you want to be that you have aimed high enough. If you ask yourself, ‘‘Who do I want to be when I face that ethical or moral dilemma?’’ you will always then come up with the right answer when you answer what the person you want to be would do. I grew up with a father who actually had a name for the belt that he wore around his waist. It was ‘‘The En-forcer.’’ I had a mother who thought I could do anything I wanted to do and a father who would kick my tail if I didn’t give it my best effort. I spent nearly 10 years as a pros-ecutor, and I can’t tell you how many times I looked down the dais at the criminal defendant and thought, ‘‘I wonder, but there for the grace of God go I’’—but for the fact that I was blessed with amazing parents who en-couraged me and loved me and dis-ciplined me and told me the things I could do, unlike so many in political office today who garner votes and sup-port by telling people what they can’t do, what they need done for them. By gosh, this country was built on a government dependent upon people, not a people dependent upon govern-ment. And that is who we are. Now, who are we going to be? Where are we going? A wiser person than I once said, if you want to know where you are going, you should look where you have been. It is a relatively humbling thing to do representing the Fifth District of Vir-ginia, because the Fifth District of Vir-ginia was first represented in this in-stitution by James Madison. I tell people those are some very small, big shoes to fill—very small, big shoes to fill. James Madison won the congressional seat when he ran in an election against a pillar of American foreign policy named Monroe. They were so collegial during their campaign that they often traveled together. When Madison was elected to Con-gress prior to the 17th Amendment, he went to the Virginia General Assem-bly—the longest serving democrat-ically elected legislative body on the planet Earth—and suggested that James Monroe should be the Senator; and, indeed, he was made the Senator. So we have Madison. We have Monroe. The drafter of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, lived in Virginia’s Fifth District. The power of the Article III branch of govern-ment, the Supreme Court, John Mar-shall retired in Virginia’s Fifth Dis-trict. Patrick Henry retired in Vir-ginia’s Fifth District. Lee and Grant sat at a table at Appomattox Court House and ended the American Civil War in the Fifth District of Virginia, and a young woman named Barbara Johns stood up in the face of possible injury or death to start the Virginia civil rights movement in the Fifth Dis-trict. So it is pretty humbling, but it gives me a good lesson in who we are. So many on my side of the aisle criti-cized President Obama when he said: If you have a business, you didn’t do that. Somebody else did that for you. I will defend him. I will defend him. You did it with blood and sweat and tears and hard work and persistence and the willingness to stand up time and again after failing. You did it, but you did it because you stood on the shoulders of giants who gave you the opportunity to do it, those imperfect people: Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, who gave us near-perfect docu-ments; James Madison, documents that have been revised, oh, I don’t know, 27 times in hundreds of years, that we constantly should strive to be a more perfect Union, that we will never achieve that status of a perfect Union so long as institutions on Earth are governed by mere mortal men, but that we have a duty in this Nation to try to continue to. So that is why I am here. I am not here to perpetuate my own power. I un-derstand that the most indispensable person is the person who recognizes that they are not indispensable. Folks, drive past the graveyard and look at the headstones, because I can promise you, there are piles of folks buried there who thought the world just couldn’t go on without them. And the band played on. The Fifth District of Virginia was here before I got here. It will be here after I leave. I am not here to perpet-uate my own name or my own legacy or any sort of power. I am here to make sure that everything I do is pointed towards giving the posterity that will follow us—to my children, S
CHWEIKERT ’s children, and your chil-dren—every bit as good, if not better, opportunities than those which we had. I believe there are two fundamental entitlements to birth of Americanism. b1945 First, you are entitled to an oppor-tunity. We should always strive to make that opportunity more of an equal opportunity. But in a world where if your last name is Clinton, Trump, Obama, or Bush, you probably have a better chance of getting into Harvard. We are not there yet. But ev-eryone is entitled to an opportunity. Everyone within the Jeffersonian con-struct of liberty that is ‘‘my freedom extends to the point where yours starts so long as you don’t harm another,’’ should be free to make decisions for yourself and has an entitlement to de-fine success for themselves. If you want to be the world’s best beekeeper, go be the world’s best bee-keeper. If you want to be a great stay- at-home dad, by golly, be a great stay- at-home dad. If you would like to work to cure cancer, please do. If you want to be a Member of this body and try to perpetuate opportunity for our pos-terity, please do. If you want to be a Member of this body and try to perpet-uate your own power or your own leg-acy, please don’t. So this brings me to the point where I stand here today. I have been here 6 months—not terribly long. Thank God I have been unable to shake my citizen world view in favor of a legislator world view. So as I walk into this Chamber and as I stand next to these women and men on both sides of the aisle, I am a little humbled. When I walk down the staircase on the edge of the original House Chamber that has been worn through time by the foot-falls of the likes of Kennedy, Madison, Monroe, Eisenhower, and Lincoln, I am humbled. But I would revert back to the words that Alexis de Tocqueville observed over 150 years ago, and that is we will thrive until we begin to attempt to bribe the taxpayers with their own money. At some point things become unsustainable. At some point we need to recognize that we are about freedom of individuals to venture and fail and venture and gain, that we are a nation whose government should depend upon people, not whose people should depend upon government. An hour and a half ago I stood on this very floor, and I dropped at the Clerk’s desk H. Res. 458. H. Res. 458 is a vehicle that would move to discharge past the normal process of procedures. H.R. 1436 is a bill that was voted for by every Re-publican Member of this body in 2015, which would provide for a repeal of the broken promises that are the Afford-able Care Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H6039 July 19, 2017 
Just yesterday, in conference, they showed us polling, and it showed that the American people trust the Repub-licans more on national defense, border security, jobs, and the economy, but we were kind of sketchy on healthcare. I can read a poll, but I came here to do what I think is right. I came here to do what I said I would do. This plan that I think could reason-ably be called the Managed Healthcare Bailout Program or the Health Insur-ance Industry Profit Enhancement Act has failed working Americans, and the paradigm under which we have debated it has failed to be an honest one. So if I am here not to enhance myself or my legacy, if I am here to do what I think is right or what I said I would do when I ran for office, then I need to stand up and do what I said I was going to do when I ran for office, and that was to ensure that the decisions of Americans were left to Americans, that we mini-mize the interference in individuals’ lives by the government, and that we recognize—and I will paraphrase—that Mr. Jefferson was correct when he said that the fruits of the working class are safest when the legislature is not in session. I believe it was Will Rogers who said: They say the only certain things in life are death and taxes, only death doesn’t get worse every time Congress meets. We hear about a CBO score that says X million people will lose coverage. The last time I looked, this thing was called the Affordable Care Act, not the Affordable Coverage Act. Even if it were called the Affordable Coverage Act, it would be a misnomer because it is not affordable. A story published about 3 months ago indicated that two-thirds of Americans couldn’t find $1,000 in case of a finan-cial crisis. But deductibles have gone from $1,000 to 2,000, to 3,000, to 4,000, to $5,000 for the average family of four. I ask you: If your deductible is $5,000 and you can’t find $1,000 in times of cri-sis, do you have healthcare? You have coverage. You have cov-erage, but you don’t have healthcare. You are still indigent, and it is a bro-ken promise. But don’t worry, there were lots more: If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. It turns out that wasn’t true. If you like your doc-tor, you can keep your doctor. It turns out that wasn’t true. We should see an average decrease of about $2,500 a year per policy. It turns out that wasn’t true. Don’t worry, these insurers who sup-ported the plan—remember the insur-ance industry endorsed the Affordable Care Act—they are doing this out of benevolence, folks. I have an article from the New York Post that says there is a cost spiral as-sociated with ObamaCare and with the insurance industry, but the cost spiral is upward. If you had bought $100 worth of UnitedHealthcare the day the ACA passed and sold it, the last time I looked, you would have $580. That is a heck of an investment. The only people making out on this are the big insur-ers. Meanwhile, rank and file Ameri-cans are perpetually lied to by folks who say: Those guys don’t care. Actually, we do. We are just not try-ing to perpetuate our own power by taking from one group and giving to another while bankrupting our Nation and robbing our children blind. So I have only been here for 6 months. I went to some people very early on and I said: How about dis-charging this bill? I am frustrated. They said: Well, it is not time for that. I said: Okay. I want to be a team player. I am frustrated, and we get to this point. The President is frustrated. The Senate is frustrated. I don’t give a hootin’ heck about the President or the Senate or this body. I care about the American people whom I serve. They are frustrated. And nobody on the other side of the aisle will talk about a plan that the namesake of the plan, President Barack Obama, said has seri-ous problems, that Minnesota Demo-cratic Governor Mark Dayton said is bankrupting his State and is unsustainable, and that President Bill Clinton said is the craziest thing. We have zero suggestions for help be-cause, by gosh, we can score political points. Shame on both sides of the aisle if you are doing this to score political points. We ought to be doing this to make sure that the fundamental birthright of Americanism, opportunity, is perpet-uated for perpetuity and that it doesn’t die in the hands of a group of the polit-ical class who say: Well, this will get me points at home. People told me not to do this. It might not help you. Your district is not that safe. I don’t rightly care. I am going to do the right thing. I have never had a job in my life that I wasn’t willing to lose if it meant doing the right thing. So what are the goals of this? This is rather brash. They are hum-ble. I want the leadership of this Cham-ber to understand that the rank and file Members support them, that we got their backs, that we thank them for their best efforts, and we don’t want to quit this fight. We thank you for what you do. Let’s keep going and keep that darn promise. I got a feeling that if you keep your promise, if you are worried about elec-tions, then your reward will come when people realize there is somebody in this town who has some integrity. So I want to support leadership. I want to send a message to the other Chamber that we are willing to act if they are willing to act, and maybe embolden them. I want to let the President know that we haven’t quit on him. But, most importantly, I want to send a message to the American people that some peo-ple in D.C. mean what they say. There have been dozens of votes for repeal by Members who knew that the repeal would never happen because it had to cross the desk of the person for whom the bill was named. It was a the-oretical abstract: Sure, I support it. We are playing with live ammuni-tion, folks. Let’s see who meant what they said. Come to this desk—and if you are watching at home, contact your Member and tell him to come to this desk—and sign onto the discharge petition, H. Res. 458. Or maybe you didn’t mean it or you did. Who knows? But let us know. Shoot straight with folks. Dozens of votes for repeal. Let me be clear about this, too. I am not sitting here trying to pull the rug out from under people. The bill that would be discharged by this resolution would not immediately end ObamaCare. Instead, it would give us a 2-year window. And I will bet you that if we repealed and had a 2-year window to debate a replacement, that we might get some input from people on both sides of the aisle. I know to a meta-physical certainty that no side has the monopoly on good ideas. I would love to have some input. There will cer-tainly be Members who say: I don’t be-lieve the Federal Government should have a large role. There will be other Members who say: We should have sin-gle payer. Right now, we are stuck in a broken system because of political gamesman-ship. It burned me when I was on the outside, and it burns me on the inside. What are the facts? What are the real facts? The average individual premium, ac-cording to eHealth, May 3, 2017, has gone up 39 percent in the last 2 years. The average family plan has gone up 49 percent. That means if you were an in-dividual and your premium was $1,000 a month, it is now $1,330 roughly a month. I am doing math on the fly in my head. If you are a family and you were paying $500 a month, then it is $740-ish a month. That is in 2 years. The average individual plan is up 147 percent from 2008. The average family plan is up 177 percent. Folks, Americans’ income hasn’t in-creased at that rate. The average is up 25 percent in the last year, and that is according to the Department of Health and Human Services’ report of October of 2016. That means if you were paying $2,000 a year ago, you are paying $2,500 now—25 percent in 1 year. Candidly, all the disingenuous argu-ments on the other side about how many will die if we move to a system that allows individuals choices are not only hollow, disingenuous, and beneath the dignity of this body by virtue of their disingenuousness, but they are also false. Folks, for the first time in nearly a generation, the mortality rate rose in 2015. U.S. life expectancy dropped from 2014 to 2015 for the first time since the 1990s. Ironically, it dropped more in States that expanded Medicaid. So I am not only disgusted with and sick of such harsh rhetoric, but I think it has now been proven demonstrably false. We talk about who will be kicked off their plan. According to the CBO, 10

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH6040 July 19, 2017 
million people lost their employer plans. Those are the plans that, if they liked, they could keep. Roughly 15 mil-lion of the people who are now insured are insured by virtue of an individual mandate. That means that we have forcefully compelled American citizens to purchase a good or service at the risk of forfeiture of their money or their freedom. We live in a country where you can choose in many places to buy mari-juana. You can choose to bungee jump. You can choose to skydive. Heck, in some places, you can choose to visit a prostitute. But you can’t choose a healthcare plan that doesn’t carry cov-erage for mental health or for mater-nity. You can’t do that. That is against the law. This is about choice. I served in the United States Army as a fire support officer, and when I left the Army, I made the egregious error of attending law school—just kidding. When I did that, I chose not to have healthcare be-cause as I looked at what I was able to do on the limited amount of money that my family had and did a cost-ben-efit analysis and the fact I was in rel-atively good shape and young, I deter-mined that our family’s best interests were served by not spending that money. It was a crazy, brazen risk that I think paid off, but it certainly should be within the purview of decisions that Americans are allowed to make, and right now it is not. I am frustrated, but I am fighting. A lot of people are frustrated, but they are fighting. I want to see our leader-ship succeed. I want to see this Nation continue to be unequivocally the great-est experiment in freedom that the Earth has ever known. But if we con-tinue to try to parlay largesse in failed programs into political power, we won’t. We won’t. The time to measure things based not on intentions, but results is nigh. In Oregon, they spent hundreds of mil-lions of dollars to create a website for the ObamaCare exchange that failed to enroll a single individual, and nobody was fired and nobody went to prison. I was a prosecutor for a long time, and I will tell you, if you waste or defraud people of 100, 200, $300 million, you usu-ally either lose your job or go to pris-on. But if you are in politics in Oregon, you are rewarded because, by gosh, you had great intentions. Let’s judge these things not by their intentions, but by their outcomes. Let’s not argue about who has cov-erage, but about who has access to af-fordable care. Let’s support revision that drives down premiums and deductibles, and let’s trumpet our vic-tories based on whom we actually help, not whom we intended to help. b2000 I stand united with the bulk of my colleagues. I know there are some who might have said one thing and now do another. This is an avenue by which we might find out who they are. I don’t, for a moment, question the individual motives of Members. I think they have an opportunity to distin-guish themselves by virtue of signing onto this resolution. I ask you again, if you are watching at home, to contact your Member if you agree with what I said and ask them if they will come to this bar when we are in session and sign their name to H. Res. 458 and demonstrate that they are willing to do the exact same thing now, when it counts, that they did dozens and dozens of times under the previous administration when they knew that their actions would be met with a veto pen. I don’t do this to score political points, I don’t do this to make my name bigger, and I don’t do this be-cause it feels good. I do this because we owe it to the giants whose shoulders we stand upon—Patrick Henry; Thomas Jefferson; Martin Luther King, Jr.; Abraham Lincoln; Barbara Johns; John F. Kennedy; and Ronald Reagan—the people who gave us the opportunity to be as successful and great as we are. Don’t piddle it away. Be responsible. Be willing to say no when no is the ap-propriate answer, and do what is right. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers should address their remarks to the Chair and not to a perceived view-ing audience.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER

HEALTHCARE  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, ObamaCare was imposed on our coun-try 7 long years ago. It has been hurt-ing the people we represent ever since. Families were supposed to spend less on healthcare costs. They actually paid more. Families were supposed to have more healthcare choices. They ended up with fewer, sometimes none at all. Worse still, for many years, we had an administration that often waived away the concerns of middle-class fam-ilies who were hurting. Today, we thankfully have an administration that has chosen instead to listen and agrees with us that Americans deserve a lot better. I appreciate the efforts of the admin-istration at every step of the process to move beyond the failures of ObamaCare. The President, the Vice President, Secretary Price, Adminis-trator Verma, so many others—we thank them for all the work they have done so far. We look forward to con-tinuing these collaborative efforts when we travel to the White House later today because we have a very im-portant task before us. As I announced last evening, after consulting with both the White House and our Members, we have decided to hold a vote to open debate on ObamaCare repeal early next week. The ObamaCare repeal legislation will ensure a stable 2-year transition pe-riod, which will allow us to wipe the slate clean and start over with real pa-tient-centered healthcare reform. This is the same legislation that a majority of the Senate voted to send to the President in 2015. Now we thankfully have a President in office who will sign it, so we should send it to him. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to move forward on the nomina-tion of John Bush, of Kentucky, to serve as a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. As I said when I introduced Mr. Bush to the Judiciary Committee, I am pleased to join the bipartisan chorus of voices supporting his nomination. More than 100 lawyers and law professors from around the country have written in support of his nomination. Nearly one-third of those supporters are Democrats. They laud Mr. Bush’s ‘‘ex-cellence, professionalism, and leader-ship in the legal profession.’’ They also note his ‘‘capacity to approach issues with an open mind and to respectfully consider the viewpoints of others.’’ In addition, some of his supporters from across the ideological spectrum and from around the country who have known Mr. Bush for decades have writ-ten separately to underscore their sup-port for his nomination. They are con-fident he understands the role of a judge, which is to fairly consider the arguments of both sides in a case and then to decide that case based on the law and nothing else. Indeed, it is pre-cisely because of his firm belief in the rule of law that they strongly support his nomination, despite the fact that he and they may hold different polit-ical and policy views. As an illustration, I think we can all agree it is not common for current or former leaders of Planned Parenthood

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4062 July 19, 2017 
to praise judicial nominees of Repub-lican Presidents, just as it is not com-mon for me to quote leaders of that or-ganization. More than one has praised the Presi-dent’s nomination of John Bush be-cause of his fairness, thoughtfulness, and respect for the views of others, re-gardless of his personal opinions. For instance, Christie Moore is on the board of directors of Planned Parent-hood of Indiana and Kentucky. She has practiced law with Mr. Bush for nearly two decades. She is ‘‘confident’’ that ‘‘he will follow the rule of law regard-less of his personal or political opin-ions. In my experience, John naturally approaches issues with an open mind and has always been respectful of dif-fering viewpoints. In fact, I am a living example of John’s ability to seek out and respect differing viewpoints and opinions. John and I come from oppo-site ends of the political spectrum—I am a life-long registered Democrat and proudly approach life and politics as a Democrat. Yet John and I have prac-ticed closely together and enjoy a strong and respectful relationship.’’ She concludes: ‘‘I can personally at-test John is a consummate profes-sional, and I believe he will be a tre-mendous asset to the federal court of appeals.’’ Her law firm colleague, Janet Jakubowicz, similarly explains why Mr. Bush will do an outstanding job on the Sixth Circuit. She states that he ‘‘has shown himself to have both the legal ability and temperament to be an outstanding judge.’’ She writes it is precisely because she is a ‘‘long time registered Democrat’’ that she can say ‘‘with extreme con-fidence’’ that John Bush ‘‘approaches issues with an open mind and has al-ways been respectful of differing view-points’’ and that he will make deci-sions on the bench ‘‘in the same man-ner, and follow the rule of law regard-less of his personal or political opin-ions.’’ Sheryl Snyder, also from my home-town, notes that he and Mr. Bush ‘‘come from different political parties and have different perspectives on many political issues.’’ Mr. Snyder says that he is ‘‘a Member of the Amer-ican Civil Liberties Union, and not the Federalist Society.’’ Nevertheless, he has ‘‘every confidence that as a Court of Appeals Judge, John will scru-pulously follow the law and apply precedent.’’ He notes that Mr. Bush is ‘‘well known . . . as an experienced, ca-pable, ethical litigator’’ and that ‘‘his knowledge of the law is unquestioned.’’ Praise for Mr. Bush is not confined to those from the Commonwealth of Ken-tucky, however. Ted Boutrous, Jr. practices law in Los Angeles. Among other matters, Mr. Boutrous rep-resented the plaintiffs in their chal-lenge to California’s Proposition 8. He has known John Bush for a quarter century. He writes that ‘‘while we come from different political parties . . . I am certain John will make an ab-solutely superb Circuit Judge. He is an extraordinary lawyer and an exception-ally fair, decent, and honest person. I have every confidence that as a judge, John will scrupulously follow the law and Constitution and precedent.’’ Mr. Bush has received numerous pro-fessional awards. For instance, the Best Lawyers in America named him the ‘‘Louisville Litigation-Antitrust Lawyer of the Year in 2017,’’ this year. Last year, the same organization rec-ognized him as the ‘‘Louisville Appel-late Practice Lawyer of the Year.’’ He has been included on the Kentucky Super Lawyers list every year for the last decade. Beginning in 2012, the Sixth Circuit appointed him to serve on its advisory committee on rules, in recognition of his in-depth knowledge of the court’s practice and procedure. In sum, as evidenced by the impres-sive testimonials of those who actually know him, John Bush is a man of in-tegrity and considerable ability. He will do an outstanding job on the Sixth Circuit. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in open opposition to the nomination of John Bush, nominated to serve a life-time appointment on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Federal courts of appeal have a significant impact on the lives of many Americans. Because the Supreme Court only reviews a limited number of cases each year, decisions by the circuit courts represent the final word on thousands of legal matters that involve a host of important issues. The Senate has to take very seri-ously its obligation to consider can-didates for these important courts. We have to make sure they have the quali-fications, the temperament, and the judgment to serve for the rest of their lives. Based on Mr. Bush’s record and his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, I believe he falls short of this standard. Over the course of his legal career, Mr. Bush has made dozens of provoca-tive comments, casting serious doubt on his temperament, his judgment, his impartiality, and his ability to serve as a fair and impartial judge. Consider the following things that this nominee has said or done: In 2008, Mr. Bush compared abortion to slavery, writing in an anonymous blog, I might add, that ‘‘the two great-est tragedies in our country—slavery and abortion—relied on similar rea-soning and activist justices at the U.S. Supreme Court, first in the Dred Scott decision and later in Roe.’’ Senator F
EINSTEIN and I decided to ask Mr. Bush to explain this statement at his hearing. He did not disavow the comparison he made in this anonymous blog. Here is what he said instead. He claimed that he had referred to Roe v. Wade as a tragedy ‘‘in the sense that it divided our country.’’ I asked Mr. Bush to explain his logic, asking whether he would characterize Brown v. Board of Education as a case that divided our country. He answered: ‘‘I wasn’t alive at the time of Brown, but I don’t think it did.’’ That is an incredible statement made by a man who seeks to serve on a Fed-eral circuit court for the rest of his life. His logic and his historical anal-ogy have fallen apart. There is no dis-pute that Brown v. Board of Education, which ended up in the official desegre-gation of public schools across Amer-ica, was a landmark Supreme Court de-cision that deemed racial segregation unconstitutional and, as a result, led to controversy and division across the United States. I can’t believe a man from Kentucky, a border State—a neighboring state of my State of Illinois—could not meas-ure the impact of Brown v. Board of Education and whether it divided our country. That, to me, is incredible. The reason, of course, he didn’t is because he didn’t want to concede, quite obvi-ously, that he was just opposed to a woman’s right to choose, and this was a rationalization for this position. There were many other instances in which Mr. Bush expressed provocative and troubling views. He wrote that public financing of election campaigns is ‘‘constitutionally dubious’’ and ‘‘runs afoul of constitutional guaran-tees by forcing taxpayers to subsidize candidates’ political speech and con-travention of those taxpayers’ First Amendment rights.’’ This is a view which is hard to under-stand because it contradicts decades of Supreme Court precedent. Mr. Bush, seeking this opportunity to serve for the rest of his life on a Federal court, has now questioned a Supreme Court precedent which has been on the books for years. He gave a speech where, sadly, he made an anti-gay slur about the town of Louisville, KY. He wrote blog posts supporting the nomination of a voter suppression advocate Hans von Spakovsky to the Federal Election Commission. In response to a written question I sent to him, he refused to disavow President Trump’s claim that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in 2016. He said it was ‘‘the subject of po-litical debate.’’ That assertion by the President has been rejected and dis-credited by every objective person who has been challenged but not by Mr. Bush, who seeks this lifetime appoint-ment to the court. Mr. Bush wrote blog posts that re-peatedly placed the terms global warm-ing and climate change in quotes, in-sinuating they did not exist. He described then-House Speaker P ELOSI as ‘‘Mama Pelosi’’ and wrote that someone should ‘‘gag the House speaker.’’ He posted articles from right wing websites, speculating that former President Barack Obama was born in Kenya. He wrote in a blog post during the 2016 Republican National Convention, ‘‘Time to roll with Trump.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4063 July 19, 2017 
The list of comments goes on and on. On a range of policies and legal issues, Mr. Bush has already made crystal clear where he stands. At his hearing, Mr. Bush asked the Judiciary Committee to trust that he could completely set aside everything I have read into the R
ECORD this morn-ing; that he can walk away from his personal views if he is confirmed to serve on the circuit court. Unfortu-nately, he has given us little reason to trust that assurance. He has no judicial experience demonstrating that he could be impartial. He spent his entire career in private practice. At his hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Bush was asked by Senator T
ILLIS , a Republican Senator: ‘‘Do you think that impartiality is an aspiration or an absolute expectation?’’ Mr. Bush responded: ‘‘It is an aspira-tion. I will do my best to be impar-tial.’’ In other words, Mr. Bush claims that he will try to be impartial but that the Senate shouldn’t expect that he will be completely successful. Here is what Senator T
ILLIS , my Re-publican colleague, then said in reply: ‘‘I actually have a concern with some-one who thinks impartiality is an aspi-ration. I think it is an expectation.’’ I agree with Senator T
ILLIS . I believe Mr. Bush’s failure to com-mit to impartiality disqualifies him from this lifetime position. Mr. Bush’s views are far outside the judicial mainstream. He provided no evidence that he could set aside his views if confirmed. I understand that Mr. Bush does check many of the boxes we have seen for recent nominees from this adminis-tration. Most important and absolutely essential to his nomination is the fact that he is a longtime member of the Federalist Society. The Federalist Society describes itself as ‘‘a group of conservatives and libertarians dedicated to reforming the current legal order.’’ The Federalist Society is funded by big money, right-wing interests like the Koch brothers, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Ed Uihlein Family Foundation. This is the group President Trump personally thanked for selecting his list of Su-preme Court nominee finalists. So far this year, every Trump judicial nomi-nee who has had a hearing before our Senate Judiciary Committee has been a Federalist Society member. Coinci-dence? I don’t think so. I urge my Republican colleagues not to let the Federalist Society serve as the selection committee—the secret handshake—to become a Federal judge for life in the United States of Amer-ica. We want a Federal bench that wel-comes independent and impartial thinkers. Mr. Bush’s Federalist Society membership shouldn’t be his ticket to the Federal bench. In conclusion, this vote, when it comes to his nomination, is really not a close call. It is clear that Mr. Bush has friends in high places, but he has demonstrated a temperament and a judgment which we should not put in a lifetime position on the Federal court of appeals. I urge my colleagues to op-pose his nomination. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mi-nority leader is recognized. 
HEALTHCARE  
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, ac-cording to the majority leader, there will not be a vote on the motion to pro-ceed to the healthcare bill until next week. In the time between now and then, my Republican friends have a choice to make about how they want to move forward on what looks like will be a failed vote. Do they want to take the path of President Trump, who yesterday said that he wanted our healthcare system to fail, or do they want to work with Democrats on legislation to improve the law? It is that simple. We Democrats know the Affordable Care Act isn’t perfect, and we propose specific legislation that could pass right now to stabilize marketplaces and lower premiums for Americans across the country. These proposals are specific, nonideological, and could pass quickly and make life better for mil-lions of Americans. A decent number of Republican Governors and even Sen-ators have said that these are the kinds of proposals we need. Here they are: First, we have proposed a bill by Sen-ator S
HAHEEN that would guarantee the premium reduction payments that in-surers say is the No. 1 thing we could do right now to stabilize the individual marketplace. Second, we have proposed a bill by Senators C
ARPER and K AINE that would create a reinsurance program for the individual health insurance market, again, aimed at stabilizing the market-places. Third, we have proposed a bill by Senator M
CCASKILL that would enable any American living in a bare county— that is, a bare county that lacks health insurers—to purchase the same insur-ance we get here in Congress. All three of these would stabilize the markets and help to prevent premiums from going up further and coverage from decreasing. They address the ac-tual issues in our healthcare system. I have mentioned they are not ideolog-ical and exactly the kind of legislation we could work on together. If our in-tent is to make things better, this is something we can come together on— all three of these proposals. They ad-dress the actual issues that we have and should be something we can do to-gether immediately. The Republican approach—deci-mating Medicaid to give a tax break to the wealthy—doesn’t solve any of the problems Republicans claim to be so worried about: high premiums, high deductibles, bare counties. In fact, by most objective reports, it makes them worse. The CBO said that under each version of the Republican plan, pre-miums would go up on many Ameri-cans, deductibles and copays would go up, there would be even more bare counties than there are today, and tens of millions would lose insurance. Repealing the healthcare law without any replacement is even worse. It would cause our healthcare system to implode, creating chaos. Millions more would lose insurance, and for millions more than that coverage would be di-minished, all of which is even worse than under the Republican bill. I hope my colleagues will join with us in working on these three nonideo-logical, practical problem solvers that will reduce premiums and make healthcare better for many, many Americans. Again, many Republicans have spoken favorably of these ideas, and I hope we will go forward. The worry I have is that our Repub-lican colleagues follow the policies of President Trump. President Trump’s promise to let our healthcare system collapse is just mind-boggling. It is hard to believe he could say something like that. President Trump’s promise to let our healthcare system collapse is so, so wrong on three counts: It is a failure morally, it is a failure politically, and it is a remarkable failure of Presi-dential leadership. First, the President’s position is a moral failure. It is morally wrong to intentionally undermine the healthcare system in this country, using Americans as political pawns in a cynical game. It is morally wrong to play a political game with healthcare in this country. There is no religious teaching or moral precept that could advocate such a cynical ploy. The President didn’t say that he wanted the system to change in a way to make it better. He said: I have lost, and I am going to make things worse for everyone to show you that I should have won. As I said, that is a moral failure that none of our religious lead-ers of any of the great religions would ever, ever accept, nor will the Amer-ican people. Second, saying ‘‘I am not going to own it’’ will not work politically. The President is the President. He is in charge. Americans look to him for leadership. They know that Repub-licans control both branches of Con-gress and the White House. They know they are in charge. Earlier this year, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that two-thirds of Americans would blame President Trump and congressional Republicans for the future problems in our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4064 July 19, 2017 
healthcare system. Just as they blamed President Obama when he was in charge, they are going to blame President Trump while he is in charge. He is tweeting away that someone else is to blame when he is in charge, which will not work politically, particularly when it comes to something as near and dear to Americans as healthcare— God’s great gift to us, life itself. It just will not work to say that Democrats are to blame. Believe me, we are not going to stand idly by and shrug our shoulders when American people are suffering because the Presi-dent is sabotaging our healthcare sys-tem for political purposes. We are going to point it out, and the spotlight will be on those whom the American people in November put in charge. Elections do have consequences, and one of the consequences, Mr. President, one of the consequences, Mr. Trump, is that you are in charge. You have to make things better, not simply point fingers and tweet. Finally, the President’s position is an astonishing failure of Presidential leadership. His own party has failed to pass a bill—his own party, which con-trols both Houses of Congress, his own party, which has used special rules de-signed to exclude Democrats from the beginning. President Trump blames Democrats and threatens to hold our Nation’s healthcare system hostage out of pique—out of pique. The President was being petty; the President was being small; the Presi-dent was not Presidential at all. The President would rather throw up his hands than roll up his sleeves and get to work. He would rather cast blame and point fingers than even try to work with Democrats to make the healthcare system better. That is not what Presidents do. It shows a tremen-dous lack of leadership. The American people want their President to lead. The American people, when there is a problem, want the President to fix it. The American people know that, when facing a defeatist President, you don’t just sit in the corner and pout and get angry. You go on from there and try to make things better, as I hope my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle will do. Some of them have indicated they will. Let’s recall another President— President Truman. President Truman famously said: ‘‘The buck stops here.’’ He was admired for it. This President’s words, shirking responsibility and cast-ing blame, were exactly the opposite of President Truman’s. ‘‘The buck stops here’’ made President Truman look tall. President Trump’s blame game makes him look small and diminished, and people will begin to totally realize his lack of leadership, and respect for him and the office will diminish. The President should rise to the in-credible responsibility of the office, not quit and take the ball home every time the game isn’t going the way he likes. The President of the United States, for better or for worse, is responsible for the healthcare of the country, for the healthcare of Americans who voted for him and for Americans who voted against him. He took an oath to faith-fully execute the laws of this country, not just the ones he likes. There is no ducking responsibility as President. The buck stops with you, President Trump. So if the procedural votes fail next week, I sincerely hope that my Repub-lican friends here in Congress reject the premise of the President to let our healthcare system collapse and hurt millions. Instead, I hope they work with us in the areas I mentioned and many others to do what is right for the American people. Mr. President, a brief word on the circuit court nominee on whom we will be voting for cloture soon. The nomi-nee, Judge Bush, in my view, is not fit for the austere office of circuit court judge. He has made some extremely troubling comments about the rights of women and the rights of the LGBTQ community. He has employed anti-gay slurs in his speeches and writings. He has disparaged a woman’s right to choose, drawing an offensive and false moral equivalency between choice and slavery. How can my Republican friends vote to elevate to the Sixth Cir-cuit a man who has said things like this? He clearly lacks the temperament re-quired of a circuit court judge, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote no on cloture and no on the nomination. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

ORDER OF PROCEDURE  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-ate recess from 1:45 p.m. until 4 p.m.; further, that all time during morning business, recess, adjournment, and leader remarks count postcloture on the nomination. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today’s vote to move forward the President’s nominee to join the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals is a new low. It is a new low that sets a dangerous standard for judges who have power to make critical decisions that impact the ev-eryday lives of the people we serve. John Bush has a clear record—think about it. He is going to be a judge if this place moves forward tomorrow. John Bush has a clear record of pro-moting bigotry and discrimination that have no place in our courts. We can’t let this nomination slide through this body. Mr. Bush advocated to the U.S. Su-preme Court that women should be barred from attending our military in-stitutions—in this case, Virginia Mili-tary Institute. Think about that. There are people in this body who just voted on the motion to proceed—a very small majority that passed this—they are

He went so far as to call the legal standard allowing women to attend ‘‘destructive.’’ And we are going to put him on the court? That wasn’t 1950. That wasn’t 1960. That wasn’t in the 1970s. That wasn’t even in the 1980s. It was in the 1990s when he said that. Luckily, our Nation’s Su-preme Court disagreed with Bush’s ret-rograde and sexist opinion by a vote of 7 to 1. But, alas, Bush wasn’t deterred. To this day, he is still a member of an or-ganization that doesn’t allow women to join. He has been a member of groups that have a history of barring Jews and African Americans. Maybe we see some signs of that at the White House, but we shouldn’t be affirming that on the Senate floor. One of these groups actu-ally changed its street address after the city of Louisville renamed the street where the front entrance sits for the boxing legend Muhammad Ali. Think about that. Senator M
CCONNELL himself resigned from that same organization because, according to the Lexington Herald- Leader, the majority leader said he ‘‘thought it was no longer appropriate to belong to a club that discriminated, and my impression was that the club did.’’ But we are bringing to the floor a vote for a judge who still belongs. Leader M
CCONNELL went on to ref-erence a commonly accepted Senate standard that Federal judges should not belong to discriminatory organiza-tions, saying: ‘‘I thought if it was inap-propriate for a federal judge to belong to an all-white club, it certainly was something a United States Senator shouldn’t do.’’ So I guess the logic here is that Sen-ators shouldn’t belong to a Whites-only club, but Senators should vote for Fed-eral judges who can belong to a Whites- only club. I agree with Senator M
CCONNELL that a Senator shouldn’t belong, but no Fed-eral judge should belong to a group with a history of discrimination, espe-cially a recent history of discrimina-tion. Bush regularly contributed to a con-servative blog using a fake name. There he advocated extreme political views on issues, including healthcare, campaign finance, LGBT rights, cli-mate change—all critical issues that come before this court, the Sixth Cir-cuit serving Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. He even cited White su-premacist sources. We are going to vote for this man? He even cited White supremacist sources that pushed the conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the United States. I know the President of the United States—the man who sits in the White House—also subscribed to those birther theories, and only late in his campaign did he say: Well, I do, in fact, believe that the President was born in the United States. He, at least—the Presi-dent of the United States, the sitting President, then-Candidate Trump—at least finally retracted that. Mr. Bush seems to continue to say that Presi-dent Obama wasn’t born in the United States and cited those White suprem-acy theorists who pushed that con-spiracy theory. He has expressed hostility toward women’s rights to make their own per-sonal, private healthcare decisions. In a 2005 public speech—again, not in 1965 or 1975 or 1985, but in a 2005 public speech, he cavalierly repeated a hateful homophobic slur. I would repeat it, but I don’t think it is proper to use that language on the floor of the Senate. I also don’t think it is proper to vote for a nominee to be a judge who feels cava-lierly that he can use that term. He said Speaker of the House NANCY  P
ELOSI should be gagged. He has at-tacked Senator T
EDCRUZ, our col-league in this body. Everyone is entitled to free speech, obviously, even if they choose to do it under a fake name. And Mr. Bush is en-titled to his political opinions, no mat-ter how offensive. I, of course, defend his right to say whatever he wants. I think others do too. But those opinions have no place in a Federal court whose job it is to interpret the law fairly and impartially. Can Mr. Bush be trusted to put aside his personal views when considering the law? Even according to his own words, he can’t. At Mr. Bush’s hearing, my friend from North Carolina, Sen-ator T
ILLIS , asked Mr. Bush if judicial impartiality is ‘‘an aspiration or an ab-solute expectation.’’ Bush responded that impartiality is an aspiration—so, in other words, not an expectation. He doesn’t think he needs to be an impar-tial judge; he just needs to be able to say that he tried. To administer the law fairly and im-partially is the No. 1 job of a judge. The ability to do so is the most basic qualification for the job. Judicial im-partiality is a principle of democracy and the backbone of our government. It is the reason African Americans and women can vote, that segregation is part of the past, and that marriage in-equality is part of the past. I saw dozens of Democrats and Re-publicans last night at the Library of Congress listen to the words of Taylor Branch, perhaps the most noted histo-rian of the civil rights movement, in an interview speaking to us about Dr. King having one foot in the Scriptures and one foot in the Constitution as he advanced and advocated for civil rights. We know what that means for our country. Last night, I saw Repub-licans and Democrats coming together and celebrating that. Then today on the Senate floor, we are voting for somebody like Mr. Bush, who eschews all of those values we hold dear as a country. The courts are the reason that women can now attend the Virginia Military Institute. It is the difference between upholding and oppressing the rights of the people we serve. Think about this: The Obergefell de-cision—Obergefell v. Hodges in Ohio— was the decision that guaranteed the right to marriage equality. It came out of the Southern District of Ohio and was initially appealed to the Sixth Cir-cuit in Cincinnati. Imagine if a man who boldly repeated homophobic slurs had heard the Obergefell appeal. Think about that. He thinks it is very accept-able in public to make speeches and use homophobic slurs, and he is now sitting on the court bench making decisions about this. Imagine if today an LGBT Ohioan or a Michigander or someone from Sen-ator MCCONNELL ’s home State or Sen-ator A
LEXANDER ’s home State of Ten-nessee—if they faced this man, could they be confident that their case would be decided fairly and impartially and that justice would be served? Could we be confident that it would when we have a man who will stand up at an event in a big city, the largest city in Kentucky, and engage in homophobic slurs? I have heard from both African Americans and Jewish Americans who are absolutely outraged at this nomi-nation, partly because he is unfit to serve and partly because now, as Sen-ator W
HITEHOUSE , my friend from Rhode Island, who has one of the best judicial minds in this body, has said, if we confirm Bush, it is going to lower the bar in the future to where it is OK to engage in racist talk or homophobic or misogynist talk; it is OK because Judge Bush did, and he is sitting on the Sixth Circuit, so why not bring some more forward? Is that the standard, that your votes today—the 51 Members of this body who voted for cloture—is that the standard you want to set for the future? Organizations with a history of fight-ing for justice and equality have writ-ten to me opposing this nomination, including the Human Rights Campaign, the NAACP Legal Defense and Edu-cational Fund, the National Council of Jewish Women, the Leadership Con-ference, and on and on and on. We have a responsibility to hold judges to the highest standard. The job demands it. The people we serve—the people whose lives can be forever changed by the decisions these judges make—deserve it. We cannot allow the bar to be lowered for what is consid-ered acceptable behavior by members of the Federal bench because as this bar is lowered, the faith of citizens in the courts and in this body falls along with it. That is the tone we are setting. That is the precedent we are setting. I am not a lawyer. A lot of my col-leagues who voted for John Bush to be confirmed are lawyers. They under-stand what precedent means. They un-derstand what political precedent means in this body. I don’t think they want that bar lowered because they know that if we do, as I said, the faith of citizens in the courts and in this body falls along with it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4066 July 19, 2017 
I hope my colleagues join me in op-posing Mr. Bush and show the Amer-ican people that the Senate still has high expectations and that we still stand for decency and impartiality in our Federal judiciary. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
UL-
LIVAN ). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are grinding the wheels here in Wash-ington, DC, in the Senate very slowly, too slowly, when it comes to con-firming the President’s nominees, first to the Cabinet and now to the sub-Cab-inet positions. When the American people elected President Trump on November 8, they knew they were electing not just one person but also his full executive branch team, most certainly when it comes to filling vital national security positions like those in the Department of Defense. But because of unprece-dented delay and obstruction from our Democratic colleagues, at the current pace, it would take more than 11 years to fully staff the executive branch—and to what end? Do our Democratic col-leagues object to the qualifications of these nominees? Well, the answer is, by and large, no. Most of these nominees have sailed through the relevant com-mittees, and some were even nomi-nated by President Obama, but that doesn’t do anything to expedite the confirmation process. So I can only be left to conclude that our Democratic friends are just trying to make it more difficult for President Trump to do his job and, in the process, make it harder for us in the Senate to do ours. On Monday, we voted to end the fili-buster of Patrick Shanahan, the nomi-nee for Deputy Defense Secretary at the Department of Defense. Thank-fully, we voted to confirm him, but he was confirmed by a vote of 92 to 7, so there wasn’t any good-faith disagree-ment about his qualifications. There wasn’t any real doubt about whether he would be confirmed, but our friends across the aisle insisted on burning as much time as possible, using every pro-cedural objection they could in order to delay it. This is the same person who passed out of the Armed Services Committee by unanimous voice vote, essentially by unanimous consent. Well, if there is one thing that is in-dispensable in the Federal Govern-ment, it is our national security. The Department of Defense has been facing a critical shortfall in leadership, which is dangerous to the Nation, especially while we are engaged in such a vast array of conflicts around the world. We have seen only 6 of President Trump’s 22 nominations confirmed, and by dras-tically delaying this process, our Democratic colleagues are promoting not only the waste of taxpayer dollars, but they are putting lives at risk. I re-cently talked to the commander of a cyber unit who said that it took months for recently appropriated money to make its way out to his unit. In the meantime, he had to make per-sonnel cuts and forgo investing in re-sources that would strengthen our cyber defenses, all because we couldn’t get administrative positions filled at the Pentagon. The type of drastic ac-tion this particular commander was forced to take is not unique. It is rep-rehensible that anyone would play poli-tics and delay for delay’s sake, espe-cially when considering the nomina-tion of a person who directly impacts the training and readiness of our troops. Of the 197 nominations to agencies made by the President so far, the Sen-ate has confirmed only 48. Addition-ally, the Senate has confirmed only 2 of the 22 judicial nominations. This is one reason the majority leader said that we are going to spend a couple more weeks during the August recess to be here, working to get our work done. I have already heard from some of our Democratic colleagues saying: Why would the majority leader make that decision? I said: All you need to do is look in the mirror and ask that ques-tion of the Democratic leader, who is leading this unprecedented effort in ob-structing and slow-walking these nomi-nations. I suspect that they are going to come forward and say: Well, let’s play nice now. Let’s make a deal. The Department of Justice, for exam-ple, has only 3 out of 19 nominations confirmed. This is the Department of Justice. The Department of Health and Human Services—by the way, we have been talking a lot about healthcare. Wouldn’t you think we need a full com-plement of nominees confirmed there? But only 3 out of 11 have been con-firmed there. In November, when the people elected President Trump, they wanted him, certainly by implication, to appoint a Cabinet of qualified individuals to help guide our country and carry out the tasks and policies of the administra-tion. I am left with the unfortunate conclusion that, really, what this is de-signed to do is to not accept the ver-dict of the voters on November 8 but to continue to obstruct this President and the executive branch by any means available in order to try to make his job harder. The problem with that is it hurts the American people. It wastes taxpayer money. It makes our country and the world more dangerous, espe-cially when his national security nomi-nees are not considered and not con-firmed. So it really does represent, to my experience, an unprecedented un-willingness to accept the outcome of the election, and it shows contempt, I believe, for the will of the American people when it came to the election on November 8. It is easy to call this what it really is. It is an unwillingness to accept the outcome of the election, further poi-soning the already toxic atmosphere here in Washington, DC, and it doesn’t need to be that way. In my experience, even after tough elections, people on both sides of the aisle would generally accept the outcome. I don’t know what the alternative might be but to accept the outcome and then try to work to-gether in the best interest of the Amer-ican people, try to find those areas where we do agree—we don’t agree on everything, but there are areas where we do agree—and to move forward and make progress. That doesn’t seem to be happening today, and it is too bad. It is unfortunate. To put this in perspective, there were only eight cloture votes of President Obama’s nominees by his first August recess in 2008. For everybody’s concern, the term ‘‘cloture votes’’ basically means invoking all of the procedures to delay things and make it harder to confirm nominees. Only eight times was that used when President Obama was President. By the time we reach the August recess this year, we will have had over three times as many clo-ture votes; that is, unnecessary obsta-cles placed in the way of timely con-firmation of President Trump’s nomi-nees, making us jump through more hoops. It is delay for delay’s sake. I be-lieve this strategy—and it is a strat-egy—is simply unconscionable and that the time-consuming parliamentary procedures and slow-walking and need-less gridlock advance no interest of the American people. I can only hope people will change in the way they approach this. Maybe if they hear from their constituents, maybe if the stories are written about it or people hear about it on the news, they will call their elected representa-tives and say: The election is over. Ac-cept the outcome and try to work to-gether in the best interest of the Amer-ican people. I think that is what our constituents expect of us. So this week we will press forward with two important nominations, John Bush to be U.S. circuit judge for the Sixth Circuit and David Bernhardt to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior. These are two additional, highly quali-fied individuals who are seriously need-ed in their respective roles, but it shouldn’t take a whole week to confirm three nominees. That is what it takes now, given the obstruction and foot- dragging on the other side. I would urge our colleagues to end their political gamesmanship for the benefit of our country and for the American people so we can move for-ward doing the people’s business. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B
URR). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4067 July 19, 2017 
HEALTHCARE  
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the most important three words in our Constitution are the first three—‘‘We the People’’—the mission statement for our Nation, laid out in supersized font so that no one would forget what this document, our Constitution, is all about. Our Founders did not start out by writing ‘‘We the privileged.’’ They did not call for a document or a form of government for ‘‘We the powerful.’’ In-deed, they wanted to make clear that the structure of the government they were founding would be very different from those in Europe that functioned for the privileged and the powerful. As President Lincoln summarized, we are a Nation of the people, by the peo-ple, and for the people. That is the vi-sion. That is the vision that I have been coming to the floor and talking about for the last year and a half— about the importance of a government that responds to the issues that affect the citizens across this country, that listens to the people of this Nation. It was President Jefferson who said that the mother principle of the United States is that we have a government within which each citizen has an equal voice. Admittedly, we had some deep flaws that had to be corrected in order to reach that objective, but that vision of each citizen’s having an equal voice was the only way that the government would reflect the will of the people and make decisions that would reflect the will of the people. Of course, it is hard to hold onto that vision because the powerful and the privileged do not like that vision. They want a government that is of, by, and for the powerful and the privileged, not of, by, and for the people. The history of the United States is one battle after another of decisions that make a foundation for families to thrive in the United States of America and decisions that raid the National Treasury for the benefit of the rich. We see that battle time and time and time again, and we have seen it very re-cently in this battle over healthcare. Today, I come to the floor to say that the people of the United States have had an incredible victory—a resound-ing victory—over those who were championing government by and for the privileged and the powerful. It is really all about this bill, this TrumpCare bill, which originated in the House of Representatives. It pro-ceeded to throw millions off of insur-ance—more than 20 million people off of insurance—in order to give tax breaks to the richest Americans. What did the House’s bill do? The House’s bill said that we will give to the 400 richest Americans $33 billion—not $33,000, not $33 million—and rip healthcare away from millions of Americans in order to pay for those kinds of tax breaks for the richest. In fact, just those tax breaks for the rich-est 400 Americans would have paid for 700,000 Americans to have had Med-icaid, which is basic healthcare insur-ance. That would have been enough to have covered the States of Arkansas, West Virginia, Nevada, and Alaska all put together. Then we saw the House’s bill come over here to the Senate, and the Senate set up a group of the secret 13. Is there anything more opposite of ‘‘we the peo-ple’’ than the secret 13 Senators meet-ing in the halls of this building and particularly choosing a room that the press would not be allowed into? They did not want to be seen entering the room or leaving the room. That is how secretive it was. That is how embar-rassed they were about the possibility of having the American people see what they were crafting. Then they came forward with the Senate’s version of the bill. Now, of the House’s version, the President of the United States of America called it mean, and he called it heartless, but the Senate’s version did not end up being much different than the House’s version—the Senate’s version that would proceed to throw more than 20 million people off of healthcare, as well, the Senate’s version that, through, maybe, the Con-gressional Budget Office’s analysis, would throw off 1 million fewer over 10 years—22 million instead of 23 mil-lion—but 1 million more over the first year, that being 13 million rather than 12 million. It proceeded to constrain basic Medicare—Medicare as it existed before ObamaCare—in such a fashion that, over time, it would put a stran-glehold onto Medicaid. Therefore, it was even meaner, if you will. It was even more heartless than the Senate’s bill. Then the secret 13 and its leadership said: We do not want to have the Amer-ican people see this, so we are not going to give the time in order to have committee hearings on it. We are going to keep it out of the healthcare com-mittee. We are going to keep it out of the Finance Committee because the ex-perts will come, and the American peo-ple will see just how terrible, how mean, how heartless this bill is. We had a zero, zero, zero process— zero days of committee examination, compared to 8 years earlier with the longest committee hearing and markup that lasted 5 weeks in the Health, Edu-cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-mittee. We had the second longest committee hearing and markup in Fi-nance 8 years earlier, which was the second longest in history. Again, the Senate’s leadership recently said: No exposure in the Finance Committee— zero days in the Finance Committee— zero days in the HELP Committee, and zero months for the Senators to go back and talk to their citizens and talk to their healthcare stakeholders about what this bill would mean. You know that something is wrong when you have a process that has di-verged so dramatically from ‘‘we the people.’’ Instead, we had the secret 13 and the zero days of committee exam-ination and the zero days in the Fi-nance Committee and the zero months to be able to consult with healthcare experts and stakeholders and, most im-portantly, zero months to be able to hold a dialogue with the citizens back home. Yet we did hear from the citizens back home. As great as the effort was to hold them at bay—to give them the stiff arm and prevent them from weigh-ing in—they weighed in nonetheless. My office received well over 8,000 phone calls. Of those, they ran 84 to 1, saying stop this diabolical TrumpCare bill. I also received a whole lot of constituent mail, with more than 25,000 people weighing in from Oregon, back home. It ran 36 to 1. With 84 to 1 and 36 to 1, when do you see such opposition? Maybe we saw such opposition be-cause the people of the United States wanted to weigh in, knowing that only the powerful special interests were meeting with the secret 13 to design this diabolical bill to rip healthcare from millions of Americans. Maybe that is why so many American citizens weighed in. Thank goodness they did weigh in. They filled our email boxes, and they overflowed our phone sys-tems. They filled the streets often and went to our home States’ offices to say that this matters, and it certainly did matter. Has there ever been a bill in the his-tory of the United States that did more damage to more people than the TrumpCare bill that was proposed here in the U.S. Senate? One of the things that the citizens of the United States did was to weigh in with their stories with all of us—with all 100 Members of this Chamber. They wanted to let us know how unexpect-edly they had been affected by their having a child who had a sudden and dramatic illness or a car accident that had occurred or, suddenly, a family member who had been afflicted with cancer or emphysema or leukemia or multiple sclerosis. The list went on and on and on—real people, real lives, real challenges, real ‘‘we the people’’ input. I heard from Caroline in Portland, the mother of two young children who wrote to me, sharing her story of rais-ing a child with special needs and the help that the Oregon Health Plan had been to her family—the Oregon Health Plan, Oregon’s version of Medicaid— and how terrified she was about not being able to afford healthcare for her child under TrumpCare. I heard from Leslie, who contacted me about his 3
1⁄2-year-old daughter Glo-ria, who suffers from a rare genetic condition that has led her to live with near constant seizures and cystic fibro-sis. She needs intensive, around-the- clock care, and she is able to get that care because of a special Medicaid waiver that helps her parents afford it. With TrumpCare, she would have lost that waiver. I heard from Jay in Eugene, who reached out to share his story about his battle with leukemia and stage IV

colon cancer. He was told he could only expect to live another 3 months, unless he received treatment. That was 2 years ago, and he is alive because he was able to access treatment. He has been able to fight the battle with can-cer and fight the battle with leukemia, and he was able to do so because of the insurance he had through ObamaCare— through the Affordable Care Act. Kerry from Corvallis wrote to me, terrified about all of the members of her family who would be uninsurable if they passed TrumpCare: her husband, because he had a blood clotting disease; her son, who suffers from epilepsy; and her 78-year-old mother, who has Alz-heimer’s. That fear of being unable to access healthcare because of a preexisting condition ran through story after story after story, but that is the system we had in the United States of America before we had the Affordable Care Act. Then, there was a woman from Ash-land who asked me not to share her name but wanted her story shared. I will call her Katie. Katie is a single mother who is currently battling can-cer—invasive breast cancer and malig-nant melanoma. This is what she wrote to me: 
In simple terms, I will die without treat-ment and the ongoing care that I have re-ceived so far through Oregon Health Plan. As a single parent, I could work 24/7 until my last breath and still my income would not af-ford me basic healthcare if it were not for the Affordable Care Act. 
Katie continued: 
With a pre-existing condition I would not be insurable, left to suffer and even to suc-cumb from my illness. Once, this was only a nightmare, but now it is a horrifying reality, too surreal to comprehend. I cannot explain the deep heartache and frustration of the thought of orphaning my son, all due to dying from an illness that could have been treated if I had been insured. 
Stories like Katie’s and Caroline’s and Gloria’s keep coming in, day after day, email after email, phone call after phone call—indeed, from individuals at my townhalls. The weekend before last, I held a lot of townhalls and a couple of special healthcare forums and a bunch of Main Street walks in Oregon. Five of those townhalls were in counties that are very red, very Republican, and I lost those counties in my reelection by rates of probably 20 to 40 to 50 percent. But at those townhalls, people came out and said: Please stop TrumpCare. One out of three individuals in rural Oregon, in Republican Oregon, are on the Oregon Health Plan. They remem-ber that, not so long ago, all they had for a healthcare plan was to say a pray-er each night and hope they didn’t get sick the next day. They would say a prayer each night and hope they would not be in an accident the next day. That is all the healthcare they had. Now they are able to get preventive care—preventive care for free. Now they are able to take their children in and get them inoculated. Now they know that, if a loved one in their fam-ily becomes ill or injured, that loved one will get the care they need, and they won’t go bankrupt in the process. That is peace of mind. Isn’t that the kind of foundation we want, to enable every family to thrive in America? Shouldn’t we consider healthcare to be a basic right, a basic service, that is provided with a healthcare system in a ‘‘we the people’’ nation, not a ‘‘we the privileged’’ nation, where healthcare is only available to those who are rich enough to buy it? That is wealth care. That is not healthcare. It is a healthcare system for ‘‘we the power-ful’’ or for the powerful who write the laws that benefit themselves but leave everyone else out in the cold. No, a ‘‘we the people’’ nation has a healthcare system suited to we the people, where we provide streets and we provide pub-lic transportation and highways as part of the common infrastructure, where we provide free public schools so that every child has a chance to thrive, and where we provide public healthcare so that every citizen can have the peace of mind that, if their loved one gets sick, they will get the care they need. But we saw the opposite this year. We saw the House bill that would have thrown 12 million people off of healthcare within a year and 23 million within 10 years. As for the President, weeks after he celebrated with his champagne glasses and his leaders from the House and weeks after he cele-brated passage, someone told him what was in the bill, and the President said: Wow, that bill is mean and heartless. Then we came to the Senate, and the secret 13 met, and what did they craft? A bill that was even meaner and more heartless. Instead of throwing 12 mil-lion people off of healthcare in a single year, it threw 13 million people off in a single year, and over 10 years, essen-tially the same number as the House. It wrote a Medicaid provision that over every subsequent year would have made Medicaid less and less accessible to people who need it. Well, that ran into a dead end. So the Senate said: Let’s recraft something that is better. And what did they do? They threw in the Cruz amendment. What did the Cruz amendment do? It is fake insurance. It is a fake insurance amendment. Do you remember those days when you would get advertisements for healthcare that said: Pay us $25 a month, pay us $50 a month, and we will give you a healthcare policy. Millions of Americans bought those policies, and they thought they had something valuable, until they became sick and went to the doctor. Then they were told: This doesn’t cover your doctor’s visit, and it doesn’t cover your x-ray. It doesn’t cover your MRI—that is for sure. It doesn’t cover the drugs you need to treat this illness. It doesn’t cover a specialist. It doesn’t cover hos-pital care. Oh, and you are pregnant? How wonderful that you are going to have a child, but your healthcare pol-icy—that fake insurance policy that you bought—doesn’t cover maternity care. Fake insurance for the people of the United States of America is the Cruz amendment that was added as a so- called improvement to the mean and meaner bill already crafted by the se-cret 13—fake insurance. To make it worse, the fake insurance system means that the healthcare policies that cover essential benefits enter into a death spiral. They become so expensive that people can’t afford them. So they don’t buy them. As a result, only those who are already ill buy the policies, and that makes the policies even more expensive, and so even fewer buy them. There it is—the Cruz amendment— fake insurance for the young and healthy, and the destruction of insur-ance with essential benefits for every-one else, pricing it out of reach. In other words, it is like a bomb going off in the healthcare system to destroy healthcare both for the young and healthy and for the older and the sick and those with preexisting conditions. So some experts weighed in on this and said how terrible that idea is. This is how destructive this is to the healthcare of Americans. Suddenly, there weren’t the votes for the Cruz fake insurance amendment, either. So now what do we have before us? We have the repeal-and-run plan com-ing to the floor of the Senate, repealing the exchanges; that is, the healthcare marketplace, where people can use sub-sidies to be able to buy insurance, ena-bling individuals who are struggling and working families—working fami-lies assembling a number of part-time jobs, often minimum-wage jobs with no benefits—to buy insurance on this mar-ketplace. By the way, this was the Republican plan for healthcare: Let’s bring to-gether a marketplace where people can compare policies and can get subsidies to be able to afford those policies. This was the Republican plan. It came from a far-right Republican think tank. It was championed by a Republican Gov-ernor. It was test-run at a State level by a Republican nominee who became the nominee of the Republican Party for President of the United States of America. Call it RomneyCare. Call it the exchange. It was the Republican plan. But my colleagues now say they don’t like their own plan, and they don’t like the expansion of Medicaid. They don’t like the free preventive conditions. They want to get rid of the possibility of your children staying on your policy until age 26. They want to get rid of the healthcare bill of rights that says that gender is no longer a preexisting condition and you can’t discriminate against women because they happen to be women. They want to get rid of the protection you have against policies that have an annual cap, which means, if you get seriously hurt or seriously ill, you don’t get cov-ered. They want to get rid of the pro-tection you have that says there can’t

be lifetime caps that destroy healthcare, so that if you are seriously sick, then, you not only hit your an-nual limit, but you hit your lifetime limit and no more care for you. Now you have a preexisting condition, and you can’t get a policy anywhere else. As for that whole set of consumer protections—the healthcare bill of rights—my Republican colleagues want to bring this bill to the floor to destroy that entire set of rights. Then, they say: After we have destroyed all of this—destroyed the expansion of Med-icaid, destroyed the funding for our healthcare clinics—somewhere down the road we might figure out a new way to provide healthcare—even though they have had year after year after year after year after year after year after year. Let’s count them all up, from the years when we crafted the ACA—with an incredible amount of Re-publican input, by the way. There were more than 100 Republican amendments that were adopted. All of those years later, and now what we have is the ma-jority party’s Republican plan to sim-ply repeal all of these pieces that have given a healthcare bill of rights to Americans, that have given struggling Americans access to healthcare, and saying: We are just going to wipe it all away and have people return to where we were before, where the only healthcare insurance they had was to say a prayer each night. That is not acceptable in a ‘‘we the people’’ republic. I know that as citi-zens across the country weigh in, they are going to say, as they again fill our inboxes and ring up our phones and visit our offices, that this is not ac-ceptable. It is not acceptable to make it impossible for an entrepreneur to leave a big company and found their company because they now have access to healthcare. That is a beautiful thing. We have launched small busi-nesses by the thousands and thousands and thousands because people were able to get healthcare without being at a large company—small businesses that used to have to just struggle to get any sort of coverage. There have been a lot of battles be-tween we the people and we the power-ful over the history of the United States of America—this 241-year his-tory. We have had those who wanted to suppress the ability of workers to orga-nize and ask for a fair share of the wealth they were creating. They want-ed to bust the union, but the union worked not only to have better benefits for the workers at the mine or at the mill but to have better work cir-cumstances for all Americans—to have a 5-day workweek, to have an 8-hour workday, to have overtime paid at time and a half, to have safer working conditions, to end the exploitation of children in child labor sweatshops, and to have employer-based health cov-erage. Again and again, workers orga-nizing in the workplace have fought not only for benefits in that workplace but for benefits for all working Ameri-cans. That is a ‘‘we the people’’ battle against the powerful and privileged who want to squeeze the working peo-ple until they have nothing—nothing left. We have had other ‘‘we the people’’ versus the powerful battles. We had one back in the 1920s, where the powerful said: Let’s deregulate everything about the banking system. Let’s turn it into a wild casino, and everybody will make a lot of money. There was massive speculation. The stock market ran up like this, and then it crashed. When it crashed, it de-stroyed the finances of millions of American working families. It left mil-lions of regular families homeless and destitute. My grandmother lived in a boxcar because of this reckless pursuit of more wealth and deregulation by the powerful and the privileged. Thousands of banks across the country closed. More than 1 million families lost their farms in the first 4 years as loans were called in. More than half of all Ameri-cans were impoverished. Ninety per-cent of children in mining commu-nities were malnourished. All because ‘‘we the privileged and powerful’’ want to crush ‘‘we the people.’’ But ‘‘we the people’’ surged back. They elected a government that estab-lished protection for depositors of ac-counts in our banks, protection through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. They elected a govern-ment that said: Let’s regulate and cre-ate honesty and integrity in the stock market—the Securities and Exchange Commission—so it is a safe place to in-vest. We can invest with confidence. They created the Tennessee Valley Au-thority to provide electricity and mod-ernize the impoverished Tennessee Val-ley region. They forged Social Security so that for the first time Americans could count on having some income when they retire. We had another ‘‘we the people’’ versus ‘‘we the powerful’’ battle: the civil rights movement. There were those who wanted to suppress oppor-tunity on the basis of race and on the basis of ethnicity. But ‘‘we the people’’ came together and said: Here in Amer-ica, it is going to be a land of oppor-tunity for every single individual. No matter your race, no matter your eth-nicity, you get a chance to thrive here in the United States of America. The doors cannot be slammed in your face. That incredible 1964 Civil Rights Act, forged right here in this Chamber where I am speaking at this very mo-ment, was an incredible ‘‘we the peo-ple’’ moment. But it is not a battle we have com-pletely won because still even today in many States across our country doors are legally being slammed in the face of our LGBTQ community. So shouldn’t we come back together, pass the Equality Act, and give every single American full opportunity in our coun-try? Right now, as we come to the conclu-sion of the healthcare battle between the privileged and the powerful and the people, we have a chance to step out of the extraordinarily partisan role that the majority in this Chamber has played, treasuring power over healthcare in order to—well, in order to what? What purpose? To what pur-pose? What mission is being fulfilled? Yes, more desks are on that side of the aisle than this side of the aisle, but shouldn’t we be here to solve problems? Shouldn’t we work together to make our healthcare system better? Buried deep within that mean and meaner bill are a couple provisions that would make our healthcare sys-tem better. There is reinsurance, which enables a company to go into a new healthcare marketplace and be insured against having a disproportionate share of sick people. That makes a marketplace function. Remember, this was the Republican marketplace plan, and they have a provision deep in their bill that would make that marketplace work better. The marketplace requires healthcare companies to know how much they are going to get paid. Right now, that is in limbo because President Trump has held up the cost-sharing payments and won’t commit to them, so nobody knows how to price their policies. He is driving healthcare companies out of one county after another after another. They are saying: We don’t know how to price our policies because we aren’t told how much we will be compensated. Well, there is a provision deep within that Republican bill that says: We are going to nail down the cost sharing. There is another provision in that bill that says we should spend more to take on the opioid epidemic. Let’s pull that out. Let’s work together. Let’s take the cost-sharing block down and the rein-surance proposal and the funding to take on opiates and other drug addic-tion across the country, combine them, and we will have something we can do to make our current healthcare system better—and make it better as we work en route to having a healthcare system where simply by virtue of being born an American, you have basic, afford-able, quality healthcare. We are a ways from that, from a Medicare for all or a Medicaid for all, but shouldn’t we as-pire to have that kind of peace of mind rather than the complexity of the sys-tem we have now? At this moment, we have the oppor-tunity to set aside our partisanship and make healthcare work better for our ‘‘we the people’’ Nation, and we should seize that moment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the nomina-tion of John K. Bush to the Sixth Cir-cuit—someone who should have no place on the Federal bench.

activist and donor in Kentucky, Mr. Bush is also a political blogger whose incendiary comments are beneath the dignity of the office he aspires to hold. On this blog, Mr. Bush hid behind a se-cret online identity to denigrate people with crude language and to question the very foundation of our country’s legal system. Mr. Bush has been a champion of the racist birther con-spiracy about President Obama. When asked about these posts during his hearing, Mr. Bush appeared to re-gret that his posts presented problems during his confirmation process and did not demonstrate any remorse for the views he expressed in his blog. In another post, Mr. Bush equated abortion and slavery, calling them ‘‘two of the greatest tragedies in Amer-ican history.’’ In Dred Scott, which is widely con-sidered to be the worst decision in Su-preme Court history, the Court held that African Americans were property, not people, and that they were not en-titled to citizenship under our Con-stitution. The American people re-jected this holding in the Civil War and in the constitutional amendments passed in its aftermath. In contrast, the core holding of Roe, as reaffirmed in Casey, is the law of the land and based on the Constitution’s protections for individuals to make in-timate and personal decisions. Comparing a constitutionally pro-tected right to slavery—a crime against humanity and one of the deep-est stains on the moral conscience of this country—is unconscionable. I question how a judge holding this kind of view would rule on any number of cases coming before him that force him to confront his strongly held ideolog-ical beliefs. Mr. Bush made repeated attempts to downplay these outrageous statements and tried to convince us that he would simply follow precedent. Saying ‘‘I will follow precedent’’ should not shield this extreme nominee from legitimate scrutiny of his ideology. Should he be confirmed, Mr. Bush will likely be presented with cases that provide opportunities to push the precedent envelope. This is particu-larly evident when examining Mr. Bush’s own writings. For example, in a 2008 blog post, he supported statements made by the majority leader, whose campaigns he supported, that judicial appointments could preserve ‘‘the anti- abortion agenda.’’ If confirmed, we have every reason to believe that Mr. Bush will take every opportunity to pursue a radical, anti-woman, anti- choice agenda. Statements like these raise serious questions about whether litigants ap-pearing before potential circuit court judge Bush could trust in the fairness that is the hallmark of our judicial system. Mr. Bush’s inability to understand why his past writings are such a big problem only deepens my concern about his nomination. As a private cit-izen, Mr. Bush has every right to ex-press his opinions in any way and on any platform he chooses. But he does not have the right to be confirmed to the Federal bench, and he doesn’t have the right to demand that we set aside the clear pattern of extremism evident in his writings when considering his lifetime appointment. There is no question that elections have consequences for who is appointed to be judges and Justices. That is part of our system. With a Republican President and a Republican majority in the Senate, many deeply conservative nominees will be confirmed to the judi-ciary. But the Senate cannot and must not become a rubberstamp for nomi-nees who do not demonstrate the abil-ity to be fair and impartial in the cases that come before them. We are reminded every day why fair and impartial judges are so important for our country and for our democracy. Just last week, Judge Derrick Watson from Hawaii tossed out the narrow lim-its the Trump administration placed on who counts as close family when en-forcing the President’s discriminatory Muslim ban. Judge Watson’s decision shows the importance of ensuring we have Federal judges who understand the rule of law and also have an appre-ciation for the impact of the court’s de-cisions on ordinary Americans. Nothing I have heard or read provides any reassurance that the American people can trust that Mr. Bush will put his views aside to render fair and im-partial decisions. I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at a time when millions of people nation-wide are speaking out and making ab-solutely clear ‘‘no to more attacks on women’s health and women’s rights and no to the kind of hate and division President Trump sowed on the cam-paign trail,’’ it is unconscionable that my Republican colleagues are moving now to confirm a circuit court nominee who is so clearly anti-women, anti- choice, and so clearly unqualified and unfit to serve on the bench. Our Republican colleagues may think that no one is paying close attention to this nomination, that perhaps they will just slip this one through. They are wrong. Today I am here, along with many of my colleagues, to take a stand, to make sure that families know just who President Trump is trying to fill our Nation’s court system with and call on Republicans to reject this nom-ination of John Bush to the Sixth Cir-cuit Court of Appeals. I consider my decisions about wheth-er to support judicial nominees to be among the most important and con-sequential choices I make as a Senator. Like Supreme Court Justices, circuit court judges have lifetime appoint-ments. They set legal precedent. They decide on the majority of Federal cases. They can change and shape the lives of generations to come. So it is a responsibility I do not take lightly. There are so many troubling aspects of this nominee’s record—previous statements, writings, legal views—they should alarm every American, from his views on LGBTQ rights, race, and cam-paign finance reform, to his vision of the environment and election laws. I would like to start with one aspect of his record that is especially impor-tant to me as a woman, a mother, a grandmother, and a U.S. Senator, and that is what this nomination would mean for women. For nearly a decade, Bush has made countless inflam-matory, offensive, and troubling com-ments on a number of issues important to women. It is not possible to go through them all, and, frankly, most should not be repeated on the Senate floor, but I do want to make clear what kind of nominee this is. Bush has likened a woman’s constitu-tionally protected right to choose to that of slavery, calling it one of the greatest tragedies in the history of our country. This harmful view is a pattern with Bush. In fact, he consistently uses anti-choice rhetoric, whether he is writing about the right to privacy or other case law. On top of that, Bush has attacked es-sential health programs for women and children. For example, he has called the Maternal, Infant, and Early Child-hood Home Visiting Program—which helps provide at-risk pregnant women the resources they need to raise healthy children—wasteful. He has authored an amicus brief ad-vocating for the Virginia Military In-stitute to continue excluding women from admission, where he stated that there are ‘‘different developmental needs of women and men.’’ Most recently, on his Judiciary Com-mittee questionnaire, he failed to dis-close memberships with various organi-zations that do not admit women, as well as people of color. I could go on and on, and any of these alone would be enough for me to oppose this nomination. There are a lot more. Along with his views about women, we have learned of a disturbing pattern of hostility toward the LGBTQ commu-nity. In several articles, Bush has praised court decisions that attack LGBTQ rights. He has used anti-LGBTQ slurs in his personal speeches. He has pub-licly applauded statements made by candidates for office and government officials that oppose marriage equality. When given an opportunity to ex-plain any of these comments or pre-vious writings during his committee testimony, he was evasive and dodged questions, and he certainly did not apologize or clarify any of those com-ments. I don’t think I need to go any fur-ther, but I hope it is becoming increas-ingly clear that this is not a normal nominee. This is someone who lacks the qualifications and character and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4071 July 19, 2017 
temperament to be appointed to a life-time position on the Federal bench. It is time for President Trump to stop trying to divide our country and use Federal court nominations to push his extreme agenda and undo progress for women and the LGBTQ community. I will remind my Republican col-leagues, we have joined together this year to reject extreme nominees like this before—Andrew Puzder and Mark Green. Those, by the way, were tem-porary Cabinet positions. This is a life-time appointment. I hope we do the right thing and reject this nomination. Before I conclude, it is my under-standing that Senate Republicans may attempt to misrepresent Bush’s harm-ful record on women. In case there is any confusion, I would like to read a statement from Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky on the Bush nomination: 
Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Ken-tucky calls on Sen. Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul to reject the nomination of John Bush to the Sixth Circuit Court of Ap-peals. Bush has demonstrated that he is unquali-fied for this federal court in upholding funda-mental constitutional rights in his writings comparing abortion and slavery, while ap-plauding statements that demonstrate a record of hostility to women and LGBTQ in-dividuals. Sen. McConnell’s statements citing PPINK board members support on the Bush nomina-tion do not reflect the organizational posi-tion of the Planned Parenthood affiliate in Kentucky and Indiana and we urge the Sen-ate to reject a nominee that lacks the inde-pendence and temperament necessary for a federal judgeship. 
Mr. President, I urge our Republican colleagues to make the right choice: to reject this nominee and put in place a person in a court position that is a life-time appointment, one who all Ameri-cans feel will represent them on the bench. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am here to oppose the nomination of John Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. I have been a member of the Judici-ary Committee since I was sworn in as a U.S. Senator 6 years ago. I have par-ticipated in dozens of confirmation hearings. Over time, I have become ac-customed to hearing nominees attempt to dodge our questions. I have rarely come across a nominee who was as re-luctant to respond to my questions as John Bush, and I have rarely felt so un-sure and concerned about how a nomi-nee would assume the responsibility of a Federal judgeship if confirmed. I should emphasize to my colleagues, as well as to the people of Connecticut, there is no nomination I take more se-riously than a Federal judgeship, hav-ing been before numerous Federal judges, district court judges, courts of appeals judges, and the U.S. Supreme Court on four cases. Having seen as a law clerk, as well as a practicing law-yer, the enormous impact and profound importance of this position, I take no job more seriously and regard no more steadfastly any responsibility that we have. Mr. Bush has previously stated that originalism was the ‘‘only principled way’’ to interpret the Constitution. When our ranking member, Senator FEINSTEIN of California, then, very rea-sonably, asked Mr. Bush if judges should always use originalism to inter-pret the Constitution, his response was this: ‘‘My personal views on constitu-tional interpretation will be irrelevant if I am fortunate enough to be con-firmed to the 6th circuit.’’ With all due respect to Mr. Bush, I could not disagree more strongly. Ask-ing judicial nominees about how they would approach the task of inter-preting the law is extraordinarily rel-evant to this job. First, judges are not robots. They have views regarding how to interpret statutes and the Constitu-tion. Applying those views is not in-consistent with judicial impartiality, but, especially for a judge on the U.S. court of appeals, those views matter greatly. The American people have a right to know what those views are for an appellate judge, who often cannot simply follow the letter or the exact words of the Constitution or the Su-preme Court’s interpretation of it. There are all kinds of gaps that may be left and questions that may be unan-swered. Circuit court judges are rou-tinely asked to address constitutional questions that the Supreme Court has never addressed or has answered in-completely, and, sometimes, yes, incor-rectly. It changes its constitutional view because of a circuit court judge who has the temerity to say that the Supreme Court either hasn’t spoken to the issue or, perhaps, has spoken dec-ades ago, at a time when that interpre-tation of the constitutional law had relevance and correctness, but not now. To do our job reviewing judicial nominees of the President, we need to know how Mr. Bush plans to do his job. His refusal to answer causes me ex-traordinary concern, particularly be-cause, in light of his previous com-ments, I have a pretty good idea how he intends to continue to apply what he believes to be the original philos-ophy. It is one thing to say forth-rightly and honestly: ‘‘That’s my phi-losophy originally.’’ It is another to completely dodge the question. I am pleased to be on the floor today with one of my really great colleagues, Senator F
RANKEN , who will speak after me, and to have followed two other ex-traordinarily distinguished Members of this body, Senators M
URRAY and H
IRONO , to focus on these concerns re-garding Mr. Bush’s approach to the question of women’s healthcare and constitutionally guaranteed reproduc-tive rights under the Fourth Amend-ment. Let me note at the outset that our Republican colleagues have referred to a letter of support for Mr. Bush from someone who is on the board of the Kentucky Planned Parenthood affil-iate. That letter in no way represents the position of the organization as a whole. In fact, the president of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky has stated that Mr. Bush ‘‘lacks the independence and temperament nec-essary for a Federal judgeship.’’ That’s the position of the President of Planned Parenthood for Indiana and Kentucky: He ‘‘lacks the independence and temperament necessary for a fed-eral judgeship.’’ The issue of a woman’s right to make decisions about when she becomes pregnant and whether she has an abortion is a constitutionally guar-anteed, protected right of every woman, regardless of where she lives and what her background is and any other circumstances. She has that right. I need to know that any person I vote to confirm to the Federal bench will approach cases involving reproduc-tive rights with the utmost care and respect for decades of hard-won prece-dent. In coming years, judges will have to determine what constitutes an undue burden—and that is a term of law, ‘‘undue burden’’—as States continue to pass new laws that try to restrict wom-en’s reproductive rights. They will have to probe the boundaries of the Court’s Hobby Lobby decision on how religious and reproductive freedoms might conflict. These issues are far from easy, and the Supreme Court has spoken to them in many respects in-completely or unclearly. So when a nominee will not tell me how he plans to approach constitu-tional interpretation—even though his record strongly reflects a hostility to reproductive rights—how can I evalu-ate? How am I to do my job when I don’t know how he is going to do his job? How am I supposed to take seri-ously his pledge to faithfully apply Roe v. Wade and related precedent? All I have left in evaluating the Bush nomination is what he said outside the confirmation process before he was nominated for this position. As many of us know, Mr. Bush was a blogger, au-thoring hundreds of posts over several years under a pseudonym. I have read his blog. In the words of one of my col-leagues, I am not impressed. He once wrote: The two greatest tragedies in our coun-try—slavery and abortion—relied on similar reasoning and activist justices at the U.S. Supreme Court, first in the Dred Scott deci-sion, and later in Roe. 
Never mind that this statement is absurd on its face. Never mind that the NAACP called it ‘‘offensive and dis-honest.’’ What concerns me at this mo-ment is how this is the best statement of his views on the constitutionality of

women’s reproductive rights that we have heard. In light of that statement, how can we expect anything else from this nominee other than the narrowing of reproductive rights? Then along with the question of how John Bush might act as a judge comes the question of how the public per-ceives him. When you search the inter-net for information about his nomina-tion, here is what you find on his blog: a post suggesting that someone ‘‘gag the House Speaker,’’ referring to former House Speaker N
ANCY PELOSI , not current House Speaker R
YAN; two posts suggesting that a reader of the blog from Kenya must somehow be con-nected to President Obama; a post ap-plauding former Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee’s statements that he believes ‘‘life begins at conception’’ and ‘‘strongly disagrees’’ with ‘‘the idea of same-sex marriage’’; and a whole collection, a menage of partisan and inflammatory language—to use some euphemism for what can be found here. Reporters who covered this nomina-tion have used words like ‘‘provoca-tive,’’ ‘‘controversial,’’ and ‘‘not nor-mal.’’ This nomination is, indeed, not normal. It is different and profound, not in a good way. The Courier-Jour-nal, Bush’s hometown newspaper, chose this headline for their coverage: ‘‘Trump’s judicial nominee from Louis-ville ducks questions about his con-troversial blog posts.’’ The article went on to quote lawyers describing his an-swers to Judiciary Committee mem-bers as ‘‘laughable,’’ ‘‘absurd,’’ and ‘‘dishonest’’—all quotes. The Judiciary Committee heard from 27 LGBT advocacy organizations and 14 reproductive rights groups, and they told us, in no uncertain terms, ‘‘no’’ to this nominee. I agree with them. Finally, Mr. Bush wants us to believe that his political views can be sepa-rated from his law practice or his pro-spective service on the court. When asked why he cited unreliable news sources like World Net Daily in his writings, he repeatedly shrugged off the question and declined answering, saying political analysis is different from legal analysis. There is truth to that point. Prior political activity is no disqualification, in and of itself, for serving as a judge, but the importance of public confidence in the judiciary is profound. The confidence of people in the fairness and impartiality of our judges is profoundly important and necessary. The courts have no army. They have no police force of their own. Their rulings are credible and enforce-able because of confidence in the fair-ness and objectivity of our judges. Someone who is so clearly unquali-fied, by virtue of his record, I cannot support. I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting against Mr. Bush’s nomination. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise also in opposition to the nomination of John Kenneth Bush. Mr. Bush, who has been nominated to serve as a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, has the dubious distinction of having anon-ymously written scores of blog posts that aren’t just offensive—which, be-lieve me, they are—but that call into question the nominee’s ability to be a fair and impartial arbiter of the law, which is the job of a judge, especially a circuit court judge. In my view, the nominee’s lengthy record of inflam-matory and intemperate writings stands as evidence that Mr. Bush falls far short of the high standards that the Senate should demand of nominees to the Federal bench. Over the course of nearly 10 years, Mr. Bush wrote under the pseudonym ‘‘G. Morris.’’ He wrote under a pseu-donym on a political blog operated by his wife, where he published hundreds of incendiary posts. Let me be absolutely clear. Being po-litically active or expressing political opinions is not a disqualifying char-acteristic in a judicial nominee—at least, not in my view. But as I said dur-ing Mr. Bush’s hearing, it is important for the Senate, in attempting to deter-mine whether a nominee is qualified to serve as a Federal judge, to assess that nominee’s judgment as a judge—to as-sess his or her judgement—and that is what I would like the President and all our Members to consider. In the hundreds upon hundreds of posts that Mr. Bush anonymously pub-lished on his wife’s blog, Mr. Bush did not demonstrate what any Member of this body would characterize as good judgment. It was far from it. During his hearing, I questioned the nominee about a series of posts in which he seemed to fixate on President Obama’s Kenyan heritage. In one post, Mr. Bush discussed an article that suggested a reporter was detained by the Kenyan Government because he was inves-tigating ‘‘Barack Obama’s connections in the country’’ and that authorities had locked up the reporter in order to prevent him from publishing what he discovered. The article Mr. Bush quoted from and linked to was pub-lished on World Net Daily, a website known for peddling conspiracy theo-ries, bogus claims, and White nation-alism. In fact, World Net Daily is wide-ly known for trafficking in birtherism—the widely debunked and racist belief that President Obama was not born in this country. Nonetheless, Mr. Bush presented the World Net Daily article as fact. This is a guy who has been nominated to be a circuit court judge calling a World Net Daily article fact. So during his confirmation hearing, I asked Mr. Bush—and I asked him over and over again—how he decided which sources to rely upon in his writings and how he determined a particular source was credible. In my view, whether a nominee is capable of discerning real news from fake news or blogs that traf-fic in conspiracy theories from legiti-mate journalism directly speaks to the nominee’s judgment. Again, the job is judge. Really now, World Net Daily? Whether and how a nominee evalu-ates the credibility of a claim or a source of information provides a win-dow into how he might approach the factual record in a case, for example. That is what judges do. But Mr. Bush couldn’t answer my question. Instead, he said: ‘‘As a blogger, I was finding things that were in the news that were of note, I thought.’’ In response to a written question I posed, Mr. Bush said that rather than perform original re-search to support his claims, he instead ‘‘relied upon readily available sources on the internet.’’ That would be the prestigious internet. Really? Really? From a nominee for the circuit court? This begs the question: How did Mr. Bush find these articles? Does the nominee consume a steady diet of disinformation and conspiracy theo-ries? I asked him that question in writ-ing. Mr. Bush responded that he did not remember how he came upon those sources and that, in fact, aside from the articles he quoted, he did not recall reading any articles from those sources, despite the fact that he linked to and quoted liberally from con-spiracy-minded websites many, many times in his writings. Despite Mr. Bush’s claims that he can’t remember how it was that World Net Daily found its way onto his com-puter screen and despite his claim that he can’t recall how he discovered and then later cited the writings of a birther conspiracy theorist, I suspect that in Mr. Bush’s case, the simplest explanation is probably the right one. I suspect the reason Mr. Bush quoted from sources like World Net Daily so frequently is that Mr. Bush frequented those sources, that he frequently read the material they published, and I sus-pect he enjoyed it. That is just a sus-picion based on my judgment. The fact that a man who anony-mously wrote inflammatory and offen-sive blog posts and who consumed in-formation from sources that routinely publish lies and racially insensitive material could be confirmed to a life-time appointment on one of the U.S. courts of appeals should shock the con-science of each and every Member of the Senate, no matter what your poli-tics are. I have served on the Judiciary Com-mittee for 8 years, and during that time I have had the opportunity to evaluate countless judicial nominees. I understand that each Senator has his or her own way of determining whether a nominee should be confirmed. Some Senators prefer nominees who embrace a judicial philosophy of originalism or strict constructionism, others reject that view. For some Senators, a nomi-nee’s view of the Second Amendment or Roe v. Wade serves as a litmus test. Setting aside the usual yardsticks by which we measure judicial nominees, Mr. Bush should strike each and every

Member of this body as manifestly un-qualified, by any measure. Through his writings alone—and I urge all of my colleagues simply to look at his writings on his blog or on his wife’s blog that he wrote with a pseudonym. They are awful. They are disgraceful. Please, I beg my colleagues, read these and say to yourself: Are these writings the writings of a man—no matter what his leanings are in terms of how constitutional law should be de-cided, what his philosophy is, whether conservative, progressive, or liberal— how we can confirm someone to the circuit court, to a Federal judgeship for life, who writes anonymously these awful, incendiary things, relying on sources that are known for spreading hatred and linking to them. I don’t think we have been here before. I don’t think we have been here before. I would beg my colleagues, before you cast this vote—I believe you could not justify to your constituents, that you could not justify to your family— please read these blog posts by this nominee and check your conscience— not at the door, check it. This is one of those incredibly unusual circumstances where somebody comes before us who, I believe, is uniquely unqualified for the job. Thank you.

SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP  
PROMOTION ENHANCEMENT ACT  
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, each Michigander I talk to has their own unique hopes and dreams, but some as-pects of the American dream are truly universal—financial security, the op-portunity for your children to grow and prosper, and a dignified retirement. We know there are almost limitless paths to achieve these shared goals. For my parents’ generation, this often meant a fair day’s pay for a day of hard work, a good wage that grew steadily over time, and perhaps a pension that could support a comfortable retirement, and even the money to help for college tui-tion for your children. For small busi-ness owners, the path could mean bootstrapping a business from scratch, scraping by at first, building a business that made a good product, and doing the right thing by your employees and growing into a profitable business. But in today’s economy, for so many people, the connection between today’s hard work and tomorrow’s economic security isn’t always so clear. New en-trants to our workforce are increas-ingly unlikely to have a pension they can rely on for retirement. We are also seeing an entire generation of business owners rapidly approaching retirement after spending a lifetime building their businesses. We have a younger genera-tion of employees who are increasingly disconnected from their employers and an older generation of entrepreneurs who are trying to figure out how to re-tire without disrupting their successful businesses. Actually, I see this as a unique op-portunity to solve two problems at once. The employee ownership model, including employee stock ownership plans—better known as ESOPs—allows employees of a company to become partial owners. ESOP plans, which often are created as heads of family- run small businesses look to retire, create employee-owners who have a real stake in the company to which they have dedicated their careers. For both management and employees, ESOPs mean that their goals are aligned—a growing, sustainable com-pany that gives a shot at prosperity for everyone, from the highest ranking employee, to midlevel managers, to the front office staff. For both business owners and em-ployees, the proven benefits of the ESOP model are clear: Employee-own-ers have higher wages, more job sta-bility, higher net worth, and larger re-tirement accounts than non-employee owners in similar companies. For en-trepreneurs who want to see the com-pany they built continue to thrive after they are gone, research has shown that businesses see their sales grow faster in the years following their con-version to employee ownership. The data is clear on what employee ownership means for a company’s bot-tom line and for workers’ performance, but when I have the chance to visit em-ployee-owned businesses, the benefits are as clear as day. Last summer, on the first day of my motorcycle tour across Michigan, I vis-ited Sport Truck USA, an aftermarket suspension and offroad distributor in Coldwater that makes world-class parts. Sport Truck USA wasn’t just proud of their offered products, they were also proud of their achievement as an employee-owned business. I met a longtime front office employee who had a retirement account worth up-wards of $1 million. I met a warehouse worker who does as well. And they were both very happy to show up for work every day. When Sport Truck was sold in 2014, the ESOP model ensured that their employee-owners had a say in whether to approve the sale and fully compensated them when it went through. Sport Truck USA is a great success story, but for many businesses, the idea of an employee-owned transition is simply not on their radar. Despite having been enshrined in the law by Congress in 1974, for many business owners and employees, the ESOP model is not well known or understood. Before an ESOP transition can take place, there can be months or some-times even years of preparation and planning that have to take place. But it is clear—the more people who are aware of their options for employee ownership, the more businesses that will decide this is the path they want to take. There is now bipartisan agreement that Congress can take steps to help businesses find the awareness and sup-port they need to make this a reality. That is why I recently introduced bi-partisan legislation with the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Sen-ator RISCH. Our Small Business Em-ployee Ownership Promotion Enhance-ment Act will increase awareness and provide technical assistance for the creation of ESOPs and other employee- ownership models. We do this by em-powering the business experts at SCORE—the nonprofit small business counseling organization—to provide in-formation about employee ownership. Many of these counselors themselves participated in ESOPs and can speak to their benefits and what it takes to transition to this structure. As a partner of the Small Business Administration, SCORE and their vol-unteers are on the ground in commu-nities across the country, and I believe they will help create the next genera-tion of employee-owners. Increasing awareness of ESOPs is a vital first step, and I am committed to finding new ways to provide resources to busi-nesses and employees as they transi-tion to employee ownership. But, for Michiganders who are looking to se-cure their futures, building awareness of the ESOP model can help make this critical transition. The Small Business Employee Owner-ship Promotion Enhancement Act will help successful small business owners retire with the peace of mind that their legacies will be carried on by the em-ployees they will have hired, mentored, and developed over the years. It will help businesses invest in their employ-ees and employees invest in their busi-nesses. When too many Americans feel as though they are being left behind, em-ployee ownership lifts up employees and gives them a real stake in their companies and the opportunity to pros-per and achieve their versions of the American dream. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4074 July 19, 2017 
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my colleagues in op-posing the nomination of John Bush to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of Ap-peals. Mr. Bush’s record leaves me deeply concerned that he has not dem-onstrated the civility, the tempera-ment, and the judgment that are the most basic requirements to be a judge on a U.S. Federal circuit court. I also have some concerns with Mr. Bush’s legal philosophy. At Mr. Bush’s confirmation hearing, I asked ques-tions about his interpretation of due process and the right to privacy. These constitutional rights protect the free-doms that are the linchpin of our mod-ern, diverse, and inclusive society. They impact real people. My concerns about Mr. Bush extend far beyond disagreements about legal philosophy. I worry more deeply about his judgment and temperament. He has published statements that demonstrate not just a lack of judg-ment and temperament but also a fun-damental lack of civility and decency. There are many examples which I could read, but let me cite just a few. He referred to the first female Speaker of the House as ‘‘Mama Pelosi’’ and said she should be gagged. He depicted a threat that Obama supporters steal-ing a campaign sign would ‘‘find out what the Second Amendment is all about.’’ He chose to repeat the use of a well-known, anti-gay slur in a speech he gave. All of this was not while he was in middle school or high school but after he had been practicing law more than 15 years. There is much more I could cite— some of it more offensive and more de-rogatory—but I frankly think they don’t expand upon my core argument. These are not the statements of someone fit to serve on a Federal cir-cuit court bench. Don’t get me wrong. Mr. Bush has every right to put these views out into the world. Even now, over in the Sen-ate office buildings, there are folks ex-ercising their First Amendment rights, protesting and, in some cases, being ar-rested today, expressing strongly their feelings. I am sure some of them are saying things that are forceful, vig-orous, even perhaps personally offen-sive to Members of the Senate as they are protesting. The vote this body will take on the nomination of Mr. Bush isn’t about his First Amendment rights, it is about whether he is capable of conducting himself in a civil way such that he can give fair treatment to all litigants who come before his court. Our vote isn’t about Mr. Bush’s own constitutional rights of free expression; it is about upholding all Americans’ constitutional rights to fair treatment before the courts and what sort of ex-pectations litigants will have when they stand before him. Mr. Bush’s judgment and his repeated choice to utilize not just negative, not just provocative but inflammatory and derogatory language when expressing himself do not suggest to me that he is capable of the fairness, the civility, and the impartiality we expect. Mr. Bush owns the reputation he has built for himself in many speeches, op- eds, blogs, and newsletters. I heard very little in the way of disavowing these prior statements at his confirma-tion hearing, suggesting that he either stands by them, doesn’t see what is wrong with them, or simply doesn’t care. I am not sure which is worse, but, to me, each of these is disqualifying. If my Republican colleagues have reservations about this nominee put-ting on the robe, sitting on a circuit court bench, and interpreting the law for years to come, I hope you will de-liver that message with your vote on the floor. I haven’t shied away from supporting President Trump’s nominees when I be-lieve they are fully qualified for the job—even when their politics have sharply diverged from my own, but this case isn’t about partisan politics. The Senate should not be a rubberstamp for nominees of any President of any polit-ical party. We must guard the balance of power and the integrity of the Fed-eral judiciary as an unbiased and fair-minded institution. President Trump has more than 100 judicial vacancies to fill. If we don’t demand any other standard of the White House than this, this problem will extend beyond the nomination of Mr. Bush to this circuit court seat, and the precious and vital reputation of our Federal judiciary will be damaged as a result. I pray we do not reach that outcome. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
FOSSIL FUELS  
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, some really big things are happening right now that are happening under the radar; people are not aware of them. One of them is the fact that the Obama war on fossil fuels is officially over now and good things are happening. This coincides with a time when we have a shale revolution. We have a sit-uation where we are actually reviving an industry that had been pushed for the last 8 years. Oil and gas accounts for over 5 percent of the jobs in the en-tire country and accounts for over $1 trillion in economic impact in the U.S. gross domestic product. In my State of Oklahoma, the indus-try directly employs nearly 150,000 peo-ple, and each of those jobs support more than two additional jobs in the State. Thanks to the election of Presi-dent Trump, help has arrived. There are some very vocal sectors in America that want to put the fossil fuel industry out of business. We know that. They are out there. They are alive and well, and the attacks will keep coming. While most inroads were made toward that goal during the Obama administration, the environ-mental extremists will continue to use our court system and the media to en-sure that the war on fossil fuels con-tinues, putting American jobs and the economy at risk. Back in Oklahoma—it is kind of funny—I have an established policy for the last 20 years that every year, at the end of every week, I will either—if I don’t have to be in Afghanistan or someplace else—I am always back in the State, never here. I have been in aviation for many years so I get one of my airplanes and travel around the State and talk to people—real people. People don’t un-derstand this because you don’t get logical questions asked or responded to here in Washington. They will say, for example—and this happened early in the Obama administration. They would come up to me and say: Explain this to me, Senator INHOFE . We have a Presi-dent who has a war on fossil fuels, try-ing to do away with fossil fuels. He doesn’t like nuclear either. Yet nuclear and fossil fuels, which is oil and gas, account for 89 percent of the energy it takes to run this machine called America. So if he is successful, how do you run the machine called America? The answer is that you can’t. With the election of a Republican-led Congress and a Republican in the White House, we should be working to-gether to address the concerns of the industries that provide cheap, reliable fuel for American energy. Unfortu-nately, as what always seems to be the case when we are in power, Republicans can’t seem to get together and work toward a common goal, dividing them-selves over some of the issues. Healthcare is no better example. But the threat against the industry and fossil fuels should be a priority of all Republicans and Democrats, wheth-er or not they come from a State de-pendent on these resources for jobs, be-cause cheaper and more reliable energy is an issue that affects all Americans, helping them to get to work, to heat their homes, and to cook their meals. Yet we already have examples of Re-publicans not working together to de-feat threats to our energy sector. We only had one CRA vote fail, and that was the one on the BLM venting and flaring rule. It was held up by some of the Republicans who want to expand a mandate they already have, and that is the renewable fuels standard. It was ultimately defeated by another Repub-lican. Now, the oil and gas industry considered this to be one of the real key regulations that was imposed by

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4075 July 19, 2017 
President Obama and that needed to be released. If anyone is interested, in my office we have accumulated all 47 of the regu-lations this administration either is in the process of doing away with or has already done away with, and these are the things putting people out of busi-ness. So some good things are happening right now. We know that programs were created at the time in our history when we were dependent on foreign oil or when our energy production at home was receding, and that all has changed. Some might not be old enough to re-member. I am. Back in the early 1970s, OPEC in the Middle East retaliated against us for helping Israel against Egypt and Syria in the Yom Kippur invasion by impos-ing an oil embargo. This resulted in long lines of cars at the pumps and in rationing. It was pretty traumatic. In the late 1970s, unrest in the Middle East again disrupted the oil market, once again causing shortages and prices to skyrocket. There is the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards program, as we call them. The CAFE standards program was created during this time of uncertainty in the oil and gas mar-ket, when we were dependent on oil from the Middle East. But the bleak fu-ture we were facing at that time didn’t happen. It wasn’t the end of the world as they said it was going to be. In fact, just the opposite happened. The United States is no longer dependent on for-eign sources for oil and gas and is in the position to export our resources and provide for better security for us here. I was very proud of the President the other day when he was in Poland and he made a speech with Putin right there. He talked about the fact that we are going to start exporting our oil and gas—and we are already doing it now— to some of these former satellite coun-tries of the Soviet Union and other countries where they want to import from us but Iran and Russia have had a lock on the exports and so they were forced to be dependent on them. That is not the case anymore. I would say, parenthetically, to any-body who believes this President was trying to cater to Putin at any time, that he stood up and said: We are going to be the ones exporting, instead of Russia, when their economy is depend-ent upon their exports. That is actu-ally happening right now. The cost of cars went up, even though that didn’t work. The CAFE standards were by government officials who thought they could force the public into smaller cars, more mileage, and all that, but that is not the way the American people responded. The cost of cars did go up $3,800 per vehicle from their standards put together for 2016. This was significant when it happened, but it didn’t change the behavior of the American people. So any small benefit of new standards estimated at 0.007 de-grees by 2100 is outweighed by the fact that consumers are doing something different than the government pre-dicted—I am happy about that—which always seems to be the case when the government starts messing with indus-try. None of this touches the effect the California waiver has on the fuel econ-omy debate and the consumer market. If California and the States that have followed had their way, liquid fuels would be phased out altogether and consumer demand and prices wouldn’t really matter. Another way Congress has tried to manipulate the fuel market when the energy future was uncertain is through the renewable fuels standards. This is not a partisan issue because it is really more of a geographical issue. People up in the core area are very strongly sup-portive of the renewable fuels stand-ards. Some other people are not. So it is not a partisan thing, as most of the things we talk about on the floor of the Senate are. In 2005—and then expanded in 2007, despite my best efforts—the RFS was created to address decreased energy production at home and to decrease carbon dioxide emissions. However, with the shale revolution, our depend-ency on foreign energy stopped. The more we learn about corn ethanol, the more we know RFS has not been the environmental solution as sold to us. In case we forgot—it has been a while ago—Al Gore was the guy who invented ethanol. This was supposed to solve all the problems out there, until Al Gore realized that the environmental com-munity, which motivated him to get involved with this issue, said: No, that is the worst thing in the world for the environment. So he had to back down. Land is increasingly set aside for the production of corn to feed the mandate, and the more corn that is diverted to ethanol production, the less there is for our food consumption and for ranchers who need corn to feed their livestock, making the cost of our food rise. That is another major issue nobody talks about anymore. Fuels with corn ethanol are less effi-cient than gasoline diesel by 27 per-cent. So while consumers may pay less at the pump than conventional fuel, they are coming back to the pump more often, and the math works so that it costs them more. This also translates into more green-house gases being released into the at-mosphere to make up for the efficiency lost in using corn ethanol. Oklahomans know this and demand for clear gas re-mains high. This is very common in Oklahoma. I actually took this picture myself. Peo-ple know, No. 1, that it is bad for the environment; No. 2, it is not good for mileage; and, No. 3, it destroys small engines. So in Oklahoma, this is what you see in almost every community. They know the demand for clear gas— gas which doesn’t have any additives— remains high in my State. Retailers in Oklahoma continue to advertise it. They also don’t like corn ethanol be-cause they understand it is not good for their engines. We heard testimony from people in the small-engine busi-ness, such as outboard motors and those things, talking about how they are quite often sued and then have to defend the thing because the damage was actually caused by the ethanol as opposed to the manufacturer. Ethanol supporters claim the warn-ing labels on the pump are sufficient to alert customers, but studies show con-sumers make fueling choices by price, and they have ruined boats and small engines, causing manufacturers and re-tailers to invest in a nationwide cam-paign to prevent misfueling. Furthermore, the mandate is not liv-ing up to its promises of advancing biofuels. In fact, over the last 5 years, the EPA has had to lower the total re-newable volume requirements to amounts below statutory requirements because advanced biofuels have not been developed in the capacity drafters of the RFS had hoped, even with a mandate. To comply with the RFS, we have become reliant on foreign imports of soybeans and ethanol from South America to count toward the RFS—the exact opposite of what the mandate was supposed to prevent in the first place. Meanwhile, supporters of the RFS want more. They want a waiver for even higher ethanol levels in gas. Cur-rently, gas with 15 percent ethanol or higher can’t be sold during the hot summer months because of its negative effect on ambient air quality. Ethanol supporters want a waiver now so that E15 and higher can be sold year round. Right now, it can’t be sold during the hot summer months, for obvious rea-sons. With all the problems with RFS, we should not give them this waiver without addressing the larger issues with the program. Between CAFE and RFS, the fuel industry has had its hands full. But the war is being waged on all fronts, and I will continue to work to make sure that doesn’t hap-pen. There are no guarantees that the next administration after President Trump will not return to the ‘‘regulate to death’’ plans of the Obama adminis-tration. I am not talking about the war on fossil fuels. We need to work to-gether to address the regulations that we were not able to address with the CRA process. By the way, the CRA process, the Congressional Review Act process, is one of the two ways that you can minimize or eliminate onerous regulations. It has been very effective. The mandate was the only one that has not been successful. All the rest of the CRAs have been successful. We went 20 years, using it effectively once in 20 years, and we have used it 47 times now. So times have changed. We are going to work with our col-leagues to get as much as we can on any legislation that looks like it might be moving both in my committee of ju-risdiction and on the Senate floor. Any

regulation that is a threat to the en-ergy sector should be addressed so we don’t find ourselves in the situation of hoping for favorable court rulings again, which is what we relied on be-fore. There are many regulations that threaten the availability of cheaper en-ergy, and I will be pursuing any means available to address them. As for the waters of the United States rule, when we talk to the farmers and the ranch-ers around the country and ask what the major problems are, they say: It is nothing found in the farm bill; it is the overregulation by the EPA. Which one regulation do they single out as being the most serious one? It is the waters of the United States. In my State of Oklahoma, the Pan-handle is a very arid area. If we change the jurisdiction from the States to the Federal Government, I am sure it will become some type of a serious problem with all of the water that is not out there. We have the waters of the United States, the Clean Power Plan, the EPA, and the BLM methane rules, and fixing compliance issues with the most recent NAAQ standards. I will also be pursuing ways to amend the RFS and CAFE programs—from re-scinding the California waiver that drives CAFE issues and harmonizing the EPA and DOT rulemaking to re-forms of the RFS program, including requiring that any E15 or higher blend be tied to the commercial availability of cellulosic ethanol, or requiring that certain criteria be reached before an E15 waiver is triggered. There are many ways in which I will be looking to address the issues I have outlined here today, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to en-sure that not only is the environment protected but that the entire fuel in-dustry is, as well, and that we have the available fuel. The latest battle on fossil fuels was won with the election of President Trump, but the war is still being waged. I will continue to defend that industry and any industry that em-ploys that number of people and pro-vides cheap energy for Americans. Again, the question that I got back in Oklahoma—where the real people are, I might add—if the Obama admin-istration had been successful—and we are dependent upon the very thing he was trying to do away with for 89 per-cent of the industry—how do we run the machine called America? The an-swer is, we can’t. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L
EE). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, our Nation’s courts are supposed to be bas-tions of justice. They are intended to be run by men and women of sober con-templation and scholarly reflection, with the temperament to put aside their own personal feelings and biases and consider the facts of the case be-fore them in order to make the best judgments possible; men and women committed to a full and fair judiciary— a judiciary that respects our constitu-tional rights. I am sorry to say that the nominee for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals does not meet those standards. This man is unfit to serve on the bench. As revealed by his own words in a series of blog posts written under a pseudonym, John Bush does not have the tempera-ment or the impartiality to sit on a court where jurists such as William Howard Taft and many eminent others have sat. Mr. Bush himself acknowledged dur-ing his confirmation hearing that ‘‘many of the blog posts used flippant or intemperate language’’—something I believe is unbecoming of an individual nominated to sit on the Federal bench. But it wasn’t just flippant language. It wasn’t just intemperate language. He wrote in an extreme rightwing, par-tisan fashion. His confirmation would threaten women’s rights and the rights of LGBTQ Americans. It would threat-en Americans’ voting rights. It would threaten issue after issue, topic after topic, of the rights embedded in our Constitution. Let’s take a few moments to look at his words and his record. Let’s look first at women’s rights and the ex-treme views he has held on this issue. In 1993, he filed an amicus brief in a Supreme Court appeal defending the Virginia Military Institute’s policy of not admitting women, stating that the military-style atmosphere of the insti-tute ‘‘does not appear to be compatible with the somewhat different develop-mental needs of most young women.’’ He was basically indicating that young women cannot handle the same rigors as men or serve in the same capacities as men—certainly a myth that has been shattered time and time again. He is locked into an 1800s view of the world. I know that my daughter, I know that her friends, I know that my colleagues who serve in the Chamber certainly don’t believe that a woman is incapable of serving in the same roles in which a man can serve. There was a 2008 blog post Mr. Bush wrote conflating a woman’s legal, con-stitutional right to choose with slav-ery. He wrote: Slavery and abortion rely on similar rea-soning and activist justices at the U.S. Su-preme Court ....  first in the Dred Scott de-cision, and later in Roe. 
It is hard to imagine how an indi-vidual takes the extraordinary human condition of slavery and the lack of freedom involved in that and compares it to a woman making decisions, with the advice of her own doctor, about her own body. One is slavery, and one is freedom—clearly not the same thing. How could any woman walking into his courtroom believe she would get a fair hearing with his extreme anti-women views? For that matter, Mr. Bush’s words and actions call into question whether he would abide by and uphold prece-dent that is far more recent; that is, the rights of the LGBTQ community in America. The Supreme Court declared in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex couples enjoy the fundamental right to marry, just like any other couple. Yet Mr. Bush has repeatedly demonstrated insensitivity and contempt for the rights of the LGBTQ community. In 2005, he gave a speech to a private club in Louisville. He apparently want-ed to bond with his audience by saying something about the town of Louis-ville—something he found positive. So he chose to use a quote related to Hun-ter Thompson, who described Louis-ville in a quote that uses a derogatory term for gay men. In the piece, Thomp-son recites the words of a man named Jimbo, who said to him over a glass of double Old Fitz: ‘‘I come here every year, and let me tell you one thing I’ve learned—this is no town to give people the impression you are some kind of. . . .’’ Fill in the derogatory word—the pejorative for gay men. Of all the pos-sible quotes this individual could choose to create a bond between him-self and his audience in Louisville, he chooses to attack the LGBTQ commu-nity. Now, he could have chosen any of a number of quotes. A member of my team did a very quick look. In mo-ments, they found a quote from the great frontiersman Daniel Boone, say-ing: ‘‘Soon after, I returned home to my family, with the determination to bring them as soon as possible to live in Kentucky, which I esteemed a sec-ond paradise.’’ That would be a nice thing to describe about Kentucky— about connecting to your audience in Louisville rather than describing the characteristics of hatred and discrimi-nation. That is where this nominee comes from—full of his vile opinions about women and about a great spectrum of people in our Nation. So much for op-portunity for all in the United States of America. The following year, he coauthored a paper criticizing the Kentucky Su-preme Court decision regarding the right to privacy, specifically focusing on LGBTQ communities. Then, a couple of years later, with the State Department updating the passport applications, he ridiculed the effort to accommodate LGBTQ in one of his posts. At a time when we should be continuing to push our country for-ward toward ensuring that the commu-nity enjoys the full measure of equal-ity they are entitled to in our Con-stitution and under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, confirming John Bush to be a Federal judge would certainly walk back many of the gains so many have made.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4077 July 19, 2017 
Then there is his opinion of money in politics. Our Constitution starts with those beautiful three words, ‘‘We the People,’’ not ‘‘We the powerful who can spend billions of dollars in third-party campaigns to have a megaphone the size of a stadium sound system.’’ No. Jefferson said, for us to really secure the will of the people, the individuals have to have essentially an equal voice. This individual who is before us today doesn’t like that whole concept of equal voice. He doesn’t like the mis-sion statement of the Constitution of the United States of America. He wants government by and for the pow-erful and the privileged and nothing less. Therefore, he should go and serve in some foreign country that doesn’t have a vision of government of, by, and for the people. He certainly doesn’t be-long in our court system in the United States of America. There is so much more that people have described, including his writing in support of the ‘‘lock her up’’ chants at last summer’s Republican convention, his trafficking in birtherism, and more and more. I will be vehemently opposing this confirmation. I urge my colleagues to do the same. Let’s fight for the vision. Let’s fight for the ‘‘We the People’’ mission on which our Constitution was founded and that we have the responsi-bility to uphold. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Massachusetts. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, so far this year President Trump and Senate Republicans have selected a long list of Wall Street insiders, corporate CEOs, lobbyists, and radical rightwing ideologues to run the Federal Govern-ment, but the Republicans haven’t stopped there. They are also working to fill vacancies on the courts with the same kind of people—nominees who re-flect pro-corporate, radically conserv-ative views that will threaten the prin-ciple of equal justice under law. That is not coincidence. Powerful rightwing groups have had their sights set on the courts for decades, and over the past 8 years they have launched a relentless campaign to capture our courts. During the Obama administra-tion, a key part of their strategy was stopping fair, mainstream nominees with diverse, professional backgrounds from becoming judges. Our Federal courts suffered the consequences. Va-cancies sat open for months. They sat open for years, and cases piled up on the desks of overworked judges. Now, with President Trump in the White House and Senate Republicans are in control of the Senate, those pow-erful interests see an unprecedented opportunity to reshape our courts in ways that will benefit billionaires and giant corporations for decades to come. Now they see their chance to stack the courts with radical, rightwing, pro-Big Business conservatives. John Bush, President Trump’s nomi-nee to sit on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, is one of those radical, right-wing, pro-business conservatives. Mr. Bush is not just a member of the ultra-conservative Federalist Society. He is the cofounder and 20-year president of the Louisville chapter. During his ca-reer, he has earned a reputation for fighting for the big guys. For example, Mr. Bush supports weakening our cam-paign finance laws so giant corpora-tions and wealthy individuals can flood our elections with unlimited contribu-tions and buy the officials they want. I believe Mr. Bush’s pro-corporate views call his qualifications to the Federal bench into question. I do not under-stand how he can be fair and impartial when his billionaire buddies show up in court. My concern about Mr. Bush runs much deeper. He has demonstrated a level of disrespect for other people that flatly disqualifies him for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. Here is just a glimpse of what the man nominated to be a Federal judge has written and said in public: In a blog post, he called for then- House Speaker N
ANCY PELOSI to be gagged. In another blog post, Mr. Bush mocked policies that recognize same- sex parents saying that ‘‘[i]t’s just like the government to decide it needs to decide something like which parent is number one and which parent is num-ber two.’’ In a speech in Louisville, he repeated a quote from a late journalist saying: ‘‘I come here every year, let me tell you one thing I’ve learned—this is no town to be giving people the impres-sion you’re some kind of. . . .’’ He fin-ished the quote with an anti-gay slur that begins with an ‘‘f.’’ There it is: dismissive, demeaning, and downright ugly. If that word makes you furious, or if you believe that term is hurtful, then think about what it means that this is the man President Trump has put forward to be a Federal judge to sit in judgment on others. Whatever his other qualifica-tions, Mr. Bush has aggressively and conclusively disqualified himself to be a judge. I think Mr. Bush knows that. In his hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Bush was not keen to defend what he said. When asked about those hateful statements, he ducked and dodged like a prize fighter. He played that old game we have seen be-fore—the ‘‘I promise to be a fair and impartial judge if I am confirmed’’ game. He is selling, and I am not buy-ing. Mr. Bush should be embarrassed to defend those statements. They are shameful. Senator M
CCONNELL might defend this man, calling those statements, as he did, ‘‘personal views about politics,’’ but I call them hateful views that dis-qualify him for a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge. Yes, decent, reason-able people can disagree on policy, and decent, reasonable people can disagree on legal interpretation, but decent, reasonable people should not disagree on basic norms that all judges in our Federal court should abide by. Anyone who thinks it is OK to use anti-gay slurs and to tell anti-LGBTQ jokes is disqualified to be a Federal judge, pe-riod. No Senator—Republican or Demo-cratic—should be willing to confirm such a man. Our courts have one duty: to dispense equal justice under the law. No one can have confidence that Mr. Bush could fulfill such a task, and no Senator should be willing to give Mr. Bush a seat on the court of appeals of the United States of America. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

REMOVAL OF NOMINATION OBJECTION Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on June 20, 2017, I notified the majority leader of my intent to object to any unanimous consent request relating to the nomination of Steven A. Engel, of the District of Columbia, to be the As-sistant Attorney General for the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, until he adequately responded to my questions regarding his views on the OLC’s May 1, 2017, opinion, ‘‘Au-thority of Individual Members of Con-gress to Conduct Oversight of the Exec-utive Branch.’’ As I have previously noted, the opin-ion erroneously states that individual Members of Congress are not constitu-tionally authorized to conduct over-sight. It creates a false distinction be-tween oversight and what it calls non-oversight requests. It relegates re-quests from individual Members for in-formation from the executive branch to Freedom of Information Act requests. I have written a letter to the President requesting that the OLC opinion be re-scinded. The executive branch should properly recognize that individual Members of Congress have a constitu-tional role in seeking information from the executive branch and should work to voluntarily accommodate those re-quests. My June 12, 2017, letter to Mr. Engel asked him several questions about the opinion, including whether the opinion

met the OLC’s own internal standards requiring impartial analysis, whether individual Members of Congress are ‘‘authorized’’ to seek information from the executive branch, and what level of deference the executive branch should provide to individual Member requests. Mr. Engel promptly responded to my letter on June 23, 2017, and to a second June 27, 2017, followup letter on July 12, 2017. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Engel’s responses be placed in the R
ECORD following my remarks. I also met with Mr. Engel in my of-fice on July 19, 2017, to further discuss and clarify his views on the authority of individual Members to request infor-mation from the executive branch. Mr. Engel’s responses, both in writing and in person, indicate that he agrees each Member, whether or not a chairman of a committee, is a constitutional officer entitled to the respect and best efforts of the executive branch to respond to his or her requests for information to the extent permitted by law. He also agreed: No. 1, that the May 1, 2017, OLC opinion on this topic failed to consider adverse legal authority, specifically Murphy v. Dep’t of the Army, 613 F.2d 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1979); and No. 2, that, if confirmed, he would review the opin-ion; and No. 3, consider whether a more complete analysis of the issue is nec-essary. I am satisfied that Mr. Engel under-stands the obligation of all Members of Congress to seek executive branch in-formation to carry out their constitu-tional responsibilities and the obliga-tion of the executive branch to respect that function and seek comity between the branches. Therefore, I agree a vote should be scheduled on his nomination, and I wish him the very best in his new role. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
Washington, DC, June 23, 2017. Hon. C
HARLES E. G RASSLEY , Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. D
EAR CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY : I write in re-sponse to your June 12, 2017 letter con-cerning the May 1, 2017 letter opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel (‘‘OLC’’). I appreciate your interest in ensuring that Members of Congress are able to obtain the information necessary to fulfill their constitutional re-sponsibilities, as well as your attention to ensuring that OLC opinions provide candid, independent, and principled legal advice. If I am confirmed as Assistant Attorney Gen-eral, I will be committed to ensuring that OLC complies with these principles. I provide here my responses to the seven questions in your June 12 Letter. 1. Are you familiar with the May 1, 2017 OLC opinion? Response: I am not currently at the De-partment of Justice, but I read the May 1, 2017 opinion shortly after it was published. 2. In your view, does this opinion meet the standards described in OLC guidance that re-quire impartial analysis of competing au-thorities or authorities that may challenge an opinion’s conclusions? If so, can you please point to the portion of the opinion which you believe fully discusses contrary authority or arguments for non-Chairmen’s need for information from the Executive Branch to carry out their constitutional function? Response: Because I am not currently at the Department of Justice, I have not had occasion to review all of the underlying precedents that may bear upon the May 1, 2017 letter opinion. I agree that an OLC opin-ion should candidly and fairly address all rel-evant legal sources, and there are judgment calls that must be made in determining what should be included, particularly with respect to letter opinions (which tend to be shorter and less formal). With respect to the May 1, 2017 opinion, I do agree that Murphy v. Dep’t of the Army, 613 F.2d 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1979), which was cited in your June 7, 2017 letter to the President, may bear upon the issues ad-dressed in the May 1, 2017 opinion. I under-stand that in 1980, and again in 1984, the De-partment of Justice advised that, with re-spect to FOIA practices, the Murphy decision did not eliminate the legal distinction be-tween requests made by Committee Chair-men and those made by individual Members of Congress. In my opinion, it would have been useful for OLC’s letter opinion to ad-dress the Department’s current under-standing of the Murphy decision in the con-text of congressional oversight. 3. Do you believe that individual Members of Congress, who are not Chairmen of com-mittees, are ‘‘authorized’’ to seek informa-tion from the Executive Branch to inform their participation in the legislative powers of Congress? Do you believe they are author-ized by the Constitution? Why or why not? Do you believe that they are authorized by Congress? Why or why not? Response: The D.C. Circuit has recognized that each member of Congress has a ‘‘con-stitutionally recognized status’’ that in-cludes a legitimate need ‘‘to request such in-formation from the executive agencies as will enable him to carry out the responsibil-ities of a legislator.’’ Murphy, 613 F.2d at 1157. I believe that individual Members are ‘‘authorized’’ to seek such information in their roles as constitutional officers. The question whether Congress has separately authorized such requests would turn upon the rules of each House of Congress. In my view, the Executive Branch should seek to satisfy the legislative interests reflected in the information requests of individual Mem-bers, to the extent practicable and con-sistent with the confidentiality obligations of the Executive Branch, 4. In your experience, what percentage of congressional requests for information are answered by the Executive Branch on a vol-untary basis? Response: In my experience at the Depart-ment of Justice, the Executive Branch seeks to answer the majority of congressional re-quests for information on a voluntary basis. Congress rarely seeks the compulsory disclo-sure of information from a Department or agency. 5. In your view, what is an appropriate rea-son for withholding information requested by an individual Member of Congress? Response: Traditionally, the Executive Branch has sought to provide Members of Congress with requested information except where there is a need to protect important confidentiality interests, such as those in-volving national security information; mate-rials that are protected by law (such as grand jury information, taxpayer informa-tion, or materials restricted from disclosure by the Privacy Act); information the disclo-sure of which might compromise open law enforcement or civil enforcement investiga-tions; presidential communications; or infor-mation involving agencies’ predecisional de-liberative communications. 6. In your view, does the Executive Branch have any Constitutional responsibility to re-spond to requests for information from indi-vidual Members of Congress as part of a process of accommodation in order to pro-mote comity between the branches? If not, why not? Response: The Department of Justice has recognized that the accommodation process ‘‘is an obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge and if pos-sible to meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch.’’ Opinion of the Attorney Gen-eral for the President, Assertion of Execu-tive Privilege in Response to a Congressional Subpoena, 5 Op. O.L.C. 27, 31 (1981). At the same time, the courts and others have dis-tinguished between official requests from Committees and those from individual Mem-bers. See, e.g., Exxon v. FTC, 589 F.2d 582, 592–93 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (recognizing that the ‘‘principle is important that disclosure of in-formation can only be compelled by author-ity of Congress, its committees or sub-committees, not solely by individual mem-bers . . .’’); Alissa M. Dolan et al., Cong. Re-search Serv., RL 30240, Congressional Over-sight Manual 65 (Dec. 19, 2014) (‘‘[N]o judicial precedent has directly recognized an indi-vidual Member’s right, other than a com-mittee chair, to exercise the committee’s oversight authority without the permission of a majority of the committee or its chair.’’). In my view, the Executive Branch should seek to satisfy the legislative needs of Members to the extent practicable and con-sistent with the confidentiality obligations of the Executive Branch. 7. Is a request from an individual, elected Member of Congress entitled to any greater weight than a FOIA request, given the Mem-ber’s broad Constitutionally mandated legis-lative responsibilities? Why or why not? Response: In view of the constitutional re-sponsibilities of individual Members of Con-gress, the Executive Branch may well pro-vide information to Members that goes be-yond the requirements of the FOIA statute, and the Executive Branch has the discretion to provide information or documents even if it would be exempt from mandatory public disclosure under FOIA. I understand that the Executive Branch does not treat individual Member requests as requests under FOIA, and thus, the Executive Branch may provide more information about Executive Branch programs than it provides to FOIA reques-tors, who are entitled to receive only docu-ments. I appreciate your attention to these impor-tant questions. Please let me know if I may be of any more assistance on these issues, or on any other matters in the future. Sincerely, S

EAR CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY : I write in re-sponse to your June 27, 2017 letter, which continues our correspondence concerning the May 1, 2017 letter opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel (‘‘OLC’’). I understand your concerns with the legal opinion, as well as with recent reports concerning Executive Branch policies governing congressional oversight. Because I am currently in private practice, I had no role in drafting the May 1 opinion, and I likewise have no familiarity with the Administration’s internal policies concerning congressional oversight requests. If I am confirmed as Assistant Attorney Gen-eral for the Office of Legal Counsel, I will re-view the May 1 opinion and ensure that OLC’s legal advice reflects my best judgment of the law and established practice in this area. I provide here my responses to the six addi-tional questions raised in your letter.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4079 July 19, 2017 
1. You acknowledged that the OLC opinion did not examine key additional authorities which recognize the constitutional role of in-dividual Members to seek information from the Executive Branch. If confirmed, will you commit to a more careful study of this issue and other questions I have raised? Response: Yes. 2. Will you commit to modifying this OLC opinion to be consistent with your own rec-ognition that individual Members ‘‘are ‘au-thorized’ to seek . . . information [from the Executive Branch] in their roles as constitu-tional officers?’’ If not, why not? Response: If I am confirmed, I will review the May 1 opinion and come to my best judg-ment of the law and established practice in this area, including with respect to any fur-ther guidance or clarifications to the May 1 opinion that may be appropriate. 3. You note in your response to Question 3 that ‘‘the Executive Branch should seek to satisfy the legislative interests reflected in the information requests of individual Mem-bers.’’ As I wrote in my June 7, 2017, letter to the President, the May 1 OLC opinion draws a distinction between ‘‘oversight’’ and ‘‘non- oversight’’ requests. I have never sent or seen a letter requesting information for ‘‘non-oversight’’ purposes, and I still do not understand what it means. As you know, courts have recognized that ‘‘oversight’’ is inherent in the legislative power and just as broad. As the Court recognized in McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135 (1927): A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legisla-tion is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not possess the requisite information—which not infre-quently is true—recourse must be had to oth-ers who do possess it. Id. at 175. This power of inquiry ‘‘encom-passes inquiries concerning the administra-tion of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes.’’ Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187 (1957). Congressional oversight encompasses a myriad of legisla-tive tools, processes, and purposes, and is not simply limited to investigations of waste, fraud, and abuse conducted by a Committee Chairman. How exactly can a congressional inquiry be distinguished on the basis of whether it is an ‘‘oversight’’ or a ‘‘non-oversight’’ inquiry, to borrow the language from the May 1 opinion? More importantly, by what authority can the Executive Branch purport to make such a determination absent explicit direction from the Legislative Branch? Response: If confirmed, I will review the distinction between ‘‘oversight’’ and ‘‘non- oversight’’ inquiries, as those terms are used in the May 1 opinion. The May 1 opinion ap-pears to draw a procedural distinction be-tween information requests made by ‘‘a com-mittee, subcommittee, or chairman exer-cising delegated oversight authority’’ and those made by individual Members who are not acting pursuant to explicit authorization of the Standing Rules of the Senate or the Rules of the House of Representatives. See Office of Legal Counsel, Letter Opinion for the Counsel to the President, Authority of Individual Members of Congress to Conduct Oversight of the Executive Branch at 3 (May 1, 2017). In support, the May 1 opinion quotes the Congressional Research Service’s Con-gressional Oversight Manual, which advises that when individual Members request agen-cy records ‘‘they are not acting pursuant to Congress’s constitutional authority to con-duct oversight and investigations.’’ Alissa M. Dolan et al., Cong. Research Serv., RL30240, Congressional Oversight Manual 56 (Dec. 19, 2014)). As we have previously discussed, the D.C. Circuit has recognized that individual Mem-bers have a ‘‘constitutionally recognized sta-tus’’ that includes a legitimate need ‘‘to re-quest such information from the executive agencies as will enable him to carry out the responsibilities of a legislator.’’ Murphy v. Dep’t of the Army, 613 F.2d 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1979). This would be true, no matter whether those requests are called ‘‘oversight’’ inquir-ies or something else. If confirmed, I will consider these issues in connection with my review of the May 1 opinion. 4. The Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2016 explicitly authorizes any member of Congress upon request to obtain informa-tion related to Inspector General reports that is not otherwise prohibited from public disclosure. Do you agree that such requests from individual Members are ‘‘oversight’’ re-quests? Why or why not? Response: I have not previously studied the referenced provision of the Inspector General Empowerment Act. As a general matter, if a statute calls for the Executive Branch to provide information in response to a request from a Member of Congress, then the Execu-tive Branch should respond—no matter whether the Member’s request would be characterized as ‘‘oversight’’ or something else—in a manner consistent with the De-partment’s other statutory and constitu-tional obligations, including its law enforce-ment, litigation, and national security re-sponsibilities. 5. I asked in my June 12, 2017, letter wheth-er the Executive Branch has any Constitu-tional responsibility to respond to individual Members of Congress. You noted, as the OLC opinion notes, that requests from individual Members cannot be compelled. But I did not ask whether individual Members have the power to compel responses. They clearly do not. As you noted in your response to ques-tion 4, ‘‘Congress rarely seeks the compul-sory disclosure of information from a De-partment or agency.’’ Your experience matches my own. As I noted in my June 7, 2017 letter to the President, most responses to requests for information—from Chairmen or not—are received voluntarily. I also be-lieve it is important to remember that many of the relevant case precedents examining questions related to congressional oversight arise in a compulsory context. By virtue of the fact that most responses are voluntary, a court has never had occasion to consider them. What I want to understand is not whether the Executive Branch will pay a legal pen-alty for refusing to answer individual Mem-ber requests, but whether such requests, made as part of their wide-ranging Constitu-tional responsibilities, are due the best ef-forts of the Executive Branch given the na-ture of those responsibilities and the need and desire for comity between the branches. Do you agree? Is this what you mean by your response: ‘‘In my view the Executive Branch should seek to satisfy the legislative needs of Members to the extent practicable’’? Response: I agree that in the interest of comity, the Executive Branch should give due weight and sympathetic consideration to requests from individual Members of Con-gress, even where the executive official is not faced with a legal penalty for refusing to answer, and that is what I meant in my prior response. 6. I asked you whether an individual Mem-ber request was entitled to any greater weight than a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. You responded that ‘‘the Ex-ecutive Branch may well provide informa-tion to Members that goes beyond the re-quirements of the FOIA’’ and that you be-lieve ‘‘the Executive Branch does not treat individual member requests as requests under FOIA, and thus, the Executive Branch may provide more information about Execu-tive Branch programs than it provides to FOIA requestors, who are entitled to receive only documents.’’ However, in my experi-ence, FOIA requestors with ready access to judicial review and experienced FOIA litiga-tors often get more information even than Congressional Committees, let alone indi-vidual Members. Unlike FOIA litigants, a Member must first convince an entire House of Congress to hold an executive branch offi-cial in contempt before obtaining judicial re-view of an information request. Should the Executive Branch strive to meet a higher standard for voluntary cooperation with Congress, given its constitutional duties, than merely disclosure of that which could be judicially mandated? If so, what would you do to ensure that Executive Branch offi-cials understand the Constitutional basis for the importance of voluntary cooperation with Congressional information requests? Response: Yes, I agree that the measure of the Executive Branch’s cooperation should not be simply what could be judicially man-dated. I believe that, in the interest and spir-it of comity, the Executive Branch should seek to satisfy the legislative needs of Mem-bers, as indicated by my prior response. That may well include providing additional infor-mation about Executive Branch programs beyond what would be available to FOIA re-questors. If confirmed, I will ensure that the Office of Legal Counsel’s legal advice in this area would be consistent with such prin-ciples. I appreciate your interest in these impor-tant questions. Please let me know if I may be of any more assistance on these issues or on any other matters in the future. Sincerely, S

HONORING CAPTAIN ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ HOLTON Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Air Force Capt. Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Holton, a lifelong resident of Butte, MT, and an intrepid Vietnam veteran. To Bob’s family, on behalf of myself, my fellow Montanans, and my fellow Americans, I would like extend our deepest gratitude for Bob’s service to this Nation. Bob was born on April 8, 1941, in Butte, MT. He graduated from Butte High School in 1959, a talented musi-cian who excelled at the saxophone, clarinet, and piano. Bob continued his education at the University of Montana, where he earned his pilot’s license and served as an outstanding military cadet with the ROTC. Bob went on to marry his high school classmate, Diane Eck, in 1962, and graduated with a business degree in 1965. Bob proudly served his country dur-ing the Vietnam War, flying an F4 Phantom as an interceptor alongside his comrade Maj. William Campbell, a fighter-bomber. Their deployment took them near the border of Laos and Viet-nam, where their plane was downed in enemy fire on January 29, 1969. This disaster sparked a tragic mys-tery for the Holton family, who have been unable to find the site of the crash, nor fully confirm its outcome. The circumstances gave them no clo-sure and left Bob’s family in pain.

Bob’s memory has been tirelessly honored, with folks across the U.S. wearing MIA bracelets in recognition of his unfinished story. The National League of Families and the Air Force have continually supported the Holton family’s search for Bill, for which they are endlessly grateful. Now, 48 years after the crash, Butte’s only Vietnam war Missing in Action has been found. Bob’s remains have been recovered and will finally be re-turned to his home State. His life and light will be honored Saturday, July 22, in a ceremonial burial at the Sunset Memorial Park. For Bob’s family, the actions by so many have helped provide closure. On behalf of a grateful Nation, I want to thank them for their hope and contin-ued support for Bob and all of our vet-erans who are missing in action. Let us now take a moment to recog-nize the life of Capt. Robert Holton and the legacy he left behind. We deeply appreciate his service to the American people.

He is a member of his school’s Junior Lego League and is involved with the For Inspiration and Recogni-tion of Science and Technology— FIRST—Lego League, as well as ka-rate. Shane has, with tremendous strength of spirit, shouldered the responsibility of fighting non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and every day exhibits remarkable bravery and courage. Shane is an ac-tive participant in the Greater Nahua Relay for Life. For his 10th birthday, in lieu of gifts, Shane asked that dona-tions be made instead to his Relay for Life team ‘‘Spuddie’s Against Cancer.’’ He raised $150 towards cancer research and achieved his personal best by walk-ing 10 miles. Shane’s civic mindedness extends to all aspects of life. He is nicknamed. ‘‘The Mayor’’ due to his gregariousness and passion for helping others. A keen political observer and participant, Shane spoke to many Presidential can-didates during New Hampshire’s most recent primary season and has ex-pressed interest in 1 day running for that office himself. He is also a student of the American Civil War, and re-cently visited Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania and will be touring the U.S. Capitol today. Shane’s commitment to his commu-nity and his love of our country and its history gives me great hope for our fu-ture. I join Shane’s parents, Laurie- Ann Gilbert and Christine Delande, in celebrating Shane on the occasion of his 10th birthday.∑ f 
REMEMBERING MAYNARD F. HAGEMEYER ∑Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to remember Maynard F. Hagemeyer, a WWII veteran and Ohio business and civic leader. Mr. Hagemeyer passed away on July 16, at the age of 98, at his home on Wil-mington Road in Clarksville; he died in the same room he was born in on No-vember 22, 1918. Maynard Hagemeyer attended Spring Hill elementary school in a one-room schoolhouse and graduated from Massie Township High School in Harveysburg, OH in 1936. He attended the University of Cincinnati, studying business admin-istration. He loved horses and, in his youth, showed Percheron and Belgian horses throughout the U.S., and in 1940, he traveled through the Panama Canal, transporting draft horses to Chile. Drafted into the U.S. Army in 1941, Maynard served almost 5 years during WWII, half in deployment overseas. He attained the rank of captain and com-manded a company in the 23rd replace-ment battalion in North Africa, serving under General George Patton. He also served under General Mark Clark in Italy. Maynard took over the family farm in 1948 and operated various business ventures over the years. These included an excavation business, a feed mill, an anhydrous ammonia and fertilizer busi-ness, an egg business, and a Standardbred racing and breeding busi-ness he started in 1957 that still con-tinues today. Active in the community, Maynard was a member of the Clarksville Ma-sonic Lodge since 1940, the Scottish Rite and Shrine since 1946, and he joined the Eastern Star in 1947 and served as ‘‘Worthy Patron’’ in 1952 and in 1962. Maynard was on the Warren County Fair Board for 42 years and the Warren County Veterans Commission for 20 years. He also served as a director of the Ohio Harness Horsemen’s Associa-tion and was the first president of the Harness Horse Youth Foundation. He stepped into public service after the death of his father in 1948, com-pleting the balance of his father’s term as Warren County commissioner. He was also a member of the Warren Coun-ty School Board for 10 years and served as a Washington township trustee for 32 years. Maynard has been recognized many times over the years, including the Pacer Grass Roots award in 1989, named a ‘‘Kentucky Colonel’’ at the age of 91, Masonic Lodge 75-year award in 2016, and the Harveysburg alumni 80- year award in 2016. Maynard and his beloved wife, Stella, were married for 71 years and had 4 children, 8 grandchildren, and 10 great- grandchildren. I would like to honor Maynard Hagemeyer for his contributions to his community, his country, and his fam-ily.∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT ZACHARY HODGES ∑Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I would like to highlight the outstanding ac-complishments of Lt. Zachary Hodges of Gainesville, FL. Four years ago, I nominated this impressive young man to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy. I recently received a letter from Zachary letting me know that he has graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy—a major milestone that his family and friends should be very proud of. Zachary also said he plans to attend medical school at the University of Florida and looks forward to serving our Nation as an Air Force physician. I am very proud to have nominated Zachary, who has already accomplished so much at the age of 22. His enduring commitment to his studies and his country is a testament to his will to succeed and serve. I have no doubt he will inspire others around him to do the same. I wish Zachary the best of luck and look forward to hearing of his contin-ued success; I am sure he has a very bright future ahead. May God bless him and all of the men and women who serve our Nation in the Armed Forces. ∑

TRIBUTE TO MACI BURKE ∑Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of my Com-merce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Maci Burke. Maci hails from Chamberlain, SD, and is a rising sophomore at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. While interning on the Commerce Committee, Maci assisted the Surface Transportation Subcommittee. She is a dedicated worker who was committed to getting the most out of her intern-ship. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Maci for all of the fine work she did for the committee and wish her continued success in the years to come.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CON-TINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN EXECU-TIVE ORDER 13581 ON JULY 24, 2011—PM 13 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-fore the Senate the following message from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying report; which was referred to the Com-mittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs: To the Congress of the United States: Section 202(d) of the National Emer-gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a na-tional emergency unless, within 90 days of the anniversary date of its dec-laration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect be-yond the anniversary date. In accord-ance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the na-tional emergency with respect to sig-nificant transnational criminal organi-zations declared in Executive Order 13581 of July 24, 2011, is to continue in effect beyond July 24, 2017. Significant transnational criminal organizations continue to threaten the safety of the United States and its citi-zens through the scope and gravity of their actions. Such organizations de-rive revenue through widespread illegal conduct and overwhelmingly dem-onstrate a blatant disregard for human life through acts of violence and abuse. These organizations often facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activi-ties of other dangerous persons. As the sophistication of these organizations increases, they pose an increasing threat to the United States. The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and ex-traordinary threat to the national se-curity, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, I have de-termined that it is necessary to con-tinue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 with respect to transnational criminal organiza-tions. D

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. VAN HOLLEN (for him-self and Mr. C
ARDIN ): S. 1582. A bill to establish the Fred-erick Douglass Bicentennial Commis-sion; to the Committee on the Judici-ary. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague and friend, Congresswoman E
LEANOR HOLMES NOR-
TON, in introducing legislation that would establish a Bicentennial Com-mission to honor Frederick Douglass in 2018. Douglass was an extraordinary in-dividual who was enslaved at birth in Talbot County, Maryland. At a young age, Douglass learned to read and write. In 1838 he escaped from Maryland and moved to New York. Then, in 1845, he published his first autobiography called ‘‘The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass: an American Slave’’. He later escaped to Great Britain to avoid being tracked down and returned to slavery in Maryland. Ultimately, British Quakers paid for his freedom, which enabled him to return to United States, settling in Baltimore, Mary-land in 1847. Frederick Douglass con-tinued to be a strong Abolitionist who campaigned against slavery and in favor of the right to vote throughout the East and Mid-West. In 1850 he oversaw the Underground-Railroad in Rochester, New York. As a Freeman he was able to hold sig-nificant positions within the Govern-ment. He served as an Advisor to Presi-dent Lincoln. He was appointed to serve as the District of Columbia Leg-islative Council, the United States Marshall and the Recorder of Deeds. He subsequently became the Ambassador to Haiti from 1889 to 1891. Despite his extensive travel, Doug-lass made four trips back to Talbot County, Maryland. He reconciled with Captain Thomas Auld who had enslaved him in the past. He made a pilgrimage to Tappers Corner in search of his grandmother’s cabin and his birthplace. As an entrepreneur, he in-vested in several enterprises, especially those that would benefit the African- American community. These included low-income housing developments in his old neighborhood in Fells Point (named Douglass Place) and at High-land Beach, a summer resort commu-nity outside of Annapolis popular with African Americans outside of Annap-olis. Two hundred years after Douglass’ birth is a fitting time to reflect upon his work and achievements and pay tribute to a man who fought for his freedom and justice for all. He stated: ‘‘We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and the future.’’ In that spirit, it will be important to honor this man and explore how his legacy can help guide the future of our Country. As Douglass stated, ‘‘The life of the Nation is secure only while the Nation is honest, truthful and vir-tuous’’. f

VISIT TO HINDU HERITAGE DAY IN ELK GROVE VILLAGE, ILLINOIS ON JULY 23RD 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today I honor the work and community en-gagement of the organizers of and participants in Hindu Heritage Day on Sunday, July 23 in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. Hinduism is one of the world’s oldest living religions, and the faith is richly diverse with traditions stretching back thousands of years. Hinduism is a religion that prides itself on plu-rality, inclusion, tolerance, non-violence, and the embrace of diversity. These same values line up with our shared American values, and it is without question that in these times, we must defend these values. When people try to divide Americans or separate us, we need to remember that all of us belong together and that diversity and inclusion make us stronger as a country. Every time I visit with members of the Hindu community, I am inspired by their devotion and their commitment to making our commu-nities stronger all over the nation. Mr. Speak-er, as a Hindu-American, I am also proud to support my many friends and family who cele-brate their religion and culture throughout the country. I honor Hindu Heritage Day on July 23, 2017 in the metropolitan Chicago area.

IN HONOR OF PAUL W. SANBORN 
HON. FRANCIS ROONEY 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a true pioneer and icon for the City of Cape Coral. Paul Warren Sanborn was a man of commitment; to his wife of 70 years, Mildred, to his daughters, Carol, Donna, and Mary, to his friends, and to the community he loved, and that loved him back. There are far too many accomplishments in a life well lived to fit into this writing, but to put it simply, Paul was Mr. Cape Coral. Paul Sanborn served his country as a B–24 gunner and radio operator with the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. Upon moving to Cape Coral in 1962, Paul immediately turned his service towards the small commu-nity of 1,100 people; as a charter member of the Rotary Club of Cape Coral and American Legion Post 90, Chamber of Commerce Presi-dent, Cape Coral Hospital Board member, Lee County Mosquito Control official, Cape Coral High School task force member, and official city historian. During his 55 years in Cape Coral, countless other charitable, business and civic organizations benefited from his gen-erosity. Paul was named citizen of the year in both 1968 and 1992. By the time that Paul Sanborn Park was dedicated in 2008, the city had grown to a population of over 160,000. Mr. Speaker, there is no greater example of service over self than Paul Sanborn. His wit, wisdom, generosity and friendship will be missed by all. f 
CONGRATULATING CATHY GERALI 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Cathy Gerali, the District Man-ager of the Metro Wastewater Reclamation District (Metro District) in Colorado, on her election as the President of the National Asso-ciation of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA). The Metro District was formed in 1961 and provides wholesale wastewater transmission and treatment services to 59 local govern-ments and approximately 1.7 million people across the Denver metro area. Cathy started her successful career at Metro District 35 years ago as an account clerk. Through her strong work ethic and dedication, she moved up the ranks to serve as the stra-tegic planning and internal control officer and Deputy Manager before being selected as Dis-trict Manager in 2008. Cathy is known as a dynamic leader who believes in recognizing her staff for their im-portant work protecting the environment, pro-tecting public health and allowing the region to thrive. Each year for Earth Day, Cathy hosts a special breakfast to celebrate employees. She is known for always being on the front lines, being accessible to employees, and checking on facility operations. She has also played key leadership roles nationally with a number of water organizations helping ad-vance both research and advocacy for munic-ipal clean water utilities. Cathy understands when we invest in our public water infrastructure we are investing in the health of our environment, our commu-nities, and our economy. Cathy’s fundamental understanding of the importance of advancing today’s clean water agencies as utilities of the future will make her an invaluable leader at NACWA. Once again, I congratulate Cathy Gerali on her election as the President of NACWA. As she has done with the Metro District, I am confident she will lead NACWA with integrity, a spirit of collaboration, and an eye toward in-novation and progress.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday I held a hearing to assess the im-pact of the Global Food Security Act and judge how it is being implemented. We exam-ined it with an eye toward reauthorization later this Congress. By way of background, as many of you know, the Global Food Security Act was a standout piece of bipartisan legislation that was passed in the last Congress. I was the author of the House version of the bill, which had the support of Ms. B
ASS and Mr. M EAD-
OWS from our subcommittee. While GFSA was only signed into law in 2016, it codified a policy that had a far longer history. Like the landmark PEPFAR program, it also bridges multiple administrations. By way of history, it was President Bush, who beginning in 2002, started to elevate the importance of food security in U.S. foreign pol-icy, especially in Africa, via the Initiative to End Hunger in Africa (IEHA), which was fund-ed through development assistance and imple-mented through USAID. At the same time, the Millennium Challenge Corporation began mak-ing substantial investments in agriculture-led economic growth programs, particularly in Afri-ca. It was from this foundation that President Obama instituted the Feed the Future Initia-tive, launched at the G8 Meeting in L’Aquila, Italy, in 2009. By that time, food insecurity as a national security issue had come to the fore. The years 2007 through 2008 saw a rise in food prices across the world, and the ensuing political turmoil this caused led to the rise, for example, of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Today, we see President Trump and his ad-ministration continuing to implement the GFSA. We are also at a point where we can begin to assess the success of implementa-tion, underscoring an important point for us legislators; it is never sufficient simply to pass legislation, but Congress has a constitu-tionally-mandated duty to make sure that the executive branch faithfully executes the laws that it passes. Among the things we heard about are re-sults from our efforts. Have we been success-ful, for example, in reducing stunting, one of the key purposes of the Act and an outcome that is measureable? We also heard about the country selection process. How are countries that we decide to partner with chosen? What criteria do we use, and is the criteria measurable and objective? Also, how faithfully is the GFSA’s mandate to work with small-holder farmers being imple-mented? As we look toward reauthorization, we need to ask ourselves what is working, what isn’t working, and what can we do better to maxi-mize the effect of our investment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1016 July 19, 2017 
Consider, for example, our nutrition pro-grams aimed at mothers and children during the first 1,000 days of life window, from con-ception to the second birthday. We know that this period is absolutely critical for achieving healthy outcomes in children that stays with them throughout their lives, helping boost their natural immunities to ward off diseases and giving them a head start in life. We hope to hear from USAID on the successes of our nu-trition interventions during the first 1,000 days. But we need to ask ourselves, are we truly firing on all cylinders? Are we achieving the best possible results in terms of nutrition and stunting reduction, or are we failing to maxi-mize our investments. USAID, for example, has a neglected trop-ical diseases program that addresses intes-tinal worms and parasites that affect close to one billion people. If this work, however, is siloed—if worms are not addressed concomi-tantly with our nutrition interventions—the question arises: Are we maximizing our nutri-tion interventions? In other words, are we feeding the future, or simply feeding the worms? It is relatively inexpensive to conduct deworming interventions among affected pop-ulations. The gains, however, can be enor-mous. One recent study on cost-effectiveness concluded that ‘‘deworming’s effect is robustly positive, with a weight gain per dollar spent more than 35 times greater’’ than those found in simple school feeding programs. Thus, we need to ask whether we are taking advantage of synergies in our nutrition efforts, by not only including deworming, but also fol-lowing up with behavior changing WaSH, or water and sanitation/health instruction. Some-times the solution of how to keep reinfestation by worms from happening can be as simple as providing children with a pair of shoes, as worms often enter the body through a foot that comes into contact with infected soil, or mak-ing sure vegetables are washed thoroughly and peeled. The question for USAID is whether we are fully utilizing such synergies. Tomorrow, the question for us here in Congress will be what we can do in our reauthorization legislation to ensure that USAID is given the necessary di-rection and tools to prioritize such synergies.

OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to join the town of Nanticoke and the medical community at-large in recognizing Dr. Stanley Dudrick for his many years of selfless medical service and innovative work. Through Dr. Dudrick’s passion for surgery and his in-vention of the total parenteral nutrition (TPN) intravenous feeding method, he has saved millions of lives and earned the distinction of being one the most influential doctors in the world. Raised in Nanticoke, Dr. Dudrick inherited the values and work ethic of his coal mining family. He drew encouragement from those in his community, including his mother’s doctors, who inspired him to pursue a higher education in medicine. After graduating from Franklin and Marshall College, he became a research fellow and surgical resident at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. It was there, at the age of 32, that Dr. Dudrick made his historic breakthrough by inventing the revolu-tionary TPN system in 1967. While his invention revolutionized the med-ical field, it was just the beginning of Dr. Dudrick’s storied career. He went on to be-come a professor of surgery at UPenn, and helped to launch the University of Texas Med-ical School’s Department of Surgery, becom-ing its chief of surgery. He also served as chairman of the surgery department at the Pennsylvania Hospital and later at the Yale University School of Medicine. In 2011, Dr. Dudrick returned home with all of this experience and success to give back to the community where his renowned career began. He is currently a professor at Misericordia University in Dallas and at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine in Scranton. This month marks 50 years since Dr. Dudrick revolutionized the medical commu-nity, and the city of Nanticoke will recognize today as ‘‘Dr. Dudrick Day’’ by unveiling a his-torical marker to be displayed outside of his childhood home. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Dr. Dudrick for his revolutionary contributions to the medical community and his selfless dedication to saving the lives of others.

IN APPRECIATION OF THE SERV-ICE OF JOSEPH EHRENKRANTZ 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize Joseph Ehrenkrantz for his dedicated service to the House of Representatives. Over the past two years, he has diligently served the House Judiciary Committee. A 2014 graduate of the University of Mary-land, Joe majored in English and Political Science. He began his career with the House Judiciary Committee Democrats shortly after graduation—initially as an intern and subse-quently as a Professional Staff member. Joe has worked tirelessly on the full range of issues that come before the Committee. These include civil rights and voting rights, state and local taxation, constitutional issues, and investor visas. Joe was also charged with keeping track of innumerable legislative and oversight details concerning the Committee. He has performed all of these tasks with his customary energy and enthusiasm. Joe has also served the Committee with re-gard to a number of administrative matters. These include coordinating briefings, staffing hearings, organizing Minority forums, providing information technology assistance, clerking markups, helping coordinate the intern pro-gram, and providing general office manage-ment. His knowledge of Committee pro-ceedings and procedure, coupled with his dedication to progressive priorities, has made him an integral member of our staff. We thank Joe for his many outstanding con-tributions to the House Judiciary Committee and the U.S. House of Representatives, and wish him well as he begins law school at Georgetown University this fall. He will surely be greatly missed. f 
HONORING THE STANISLAUS COUNTY POLICE ACTIVITIES LEAGUE (PAL) 
HON. JEFF DENHAM 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Stanislaus County Police Activities League (PAL) for its dedication to educating our youth in public safety. It has served as an extraordinary step in promoting strong commu-nities throughout Stanislaus County. Originally known as the Stanislaus County Police Athletics League, PAL was created 25 years ago in 1992 by then-Sheriff Les Weidman. He saw the negative impact that drug addiction, gang violence, and other crimi-nal activity was having in Stanislaus County, and wanted to do something about it. So, to-gether with Stanislaus County Superintendent of Schools Martin Peterson, they started PAL. The first event they debuted was a boxing pro-gram at Mae Hensley Junior High in Ceres. Since then, PAL has continued to grow. The pursuit of opportunities that get kids in-volved in their community is paramount to the success of Stanislaus County. Children in-volved in this program will attain the skills nec-essary to be successful both in their class-room and in their future career-making deci-sions. Additionally, kids coming out of the PAL program will learn skills and activities that set an example for younger generations. These are just a few of the reasons why PAL is de-serving of praise. Mr. Speaker, please join me in commending everyone involved in the great work that PAL does for our community. Also, I want to con-gratulate the Stanislaus County Police Activi-ties League on its 25th Anniversary in sup-porting our youth.

HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my gratitude for Barbara Cleland, the Aurora City Councilwoman at-large, for her ex-traordinary work and dedication to the city of Aurora for the past three decades. Her leader-ship has contributed to many of Aurora’s most successful programs and initiatives. Barb Cleland has made the decision to re-tire from politics so that she may spend more time with her family and five grand-children. Her tenure in local politics was one that brought positive change and development to a city that has experienced great growth since she was first elected. Throughout her tenure, Councilwoman Cleland has sought to advance this city to its greatest potential. From relocating the Univer-sity of Colorado Health Center, to putting stop signs on a street, her work is as meticulous as it is beneficial to the community around her. Despite retiring from the City Council, she will continue serving on the board for the Aurora Housing Authority, the Colorado State Housing Board, and as the Legislative and Community Relations director at Aurora Mental Health. Her focus on Public Safety, Courts, and Civil Service during her decades of dedicated serv-ice on the City Council for the City of Aurora reveals her commitment to her constituents and to their well-being. Barb Cleland has enhanced the quality of life for every citizen in the City of Aurora. Her leadership during the last 28 years have made the City of Aurora the great place it is today. Mr. Speaker, a great nation cannot exist without great representatives in local govern-ment. I believe that Ms. Barbara Cleland is among the very best and I am very grateful for her unyielding dedication to public service.

INTRODUCTION OF HOUSE RESO-LUTION SUPPORTING THE DE-VELOPMENT OF PROGRAMS THAT PREPARE STUDENTS FOR CAREERS IN CYBERSECURITY 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today, I am in-troducing a House Resolution supporting the development of programs that prepare stu-dents for careers in cybersecurity. As a Member of the Committee on Home-land Security, I have come to understand that we need to invest in our nation’s students to make sure our country is prepared to combat the cyber challenges of the 21st century. It is critical that the United States develop cyberse-curity programs that allow students to keep up with the demands of rapidly evolving tech-nology and to address the risks associated with cyber threats. The United States faces a critical shortage of trained cybersecurity professionals, a short-age that includes an estimated 10,000 cyber-security employment openings in the Federal Government alone. This number is likely to grow to as many as one million unfilled posi-tions throughout the United States by 2019. Educating and training our students is vital to bolster the cyber capabilities of our govern-ment, military, and private sector. By encouraging students to develop cyber skills, we can begin to work towards building robust cybersecurity education. It is well known that early exposure to skills such as computer programming and ethical hacking in-creases accessibility to higher education and can encourage students to pursue a career in cybersecurity. Over the years, the United States has be-come a target of a growing number of mali-cious cyber attacks, including large-scale breaches that compromise the personal identi-ties and personal information of millions of Americans. These cyber threats pose a signifi-cant risk to the protection of our critical infra-structure, privacy, and national security. It is essential that our country continues to support the development of cybersecurity edu-cation programs to ensure the United States is protected from cyber attacks. Our students are the key to the future, and we must do every-thing we can to make sure they are equipped with the skills necessary to combat the cyber challenges of the 21st century. f

H.R. 2810, THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FIS-CAL YEAR 2018 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, I voted against H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. The legislation includes several provisions that I strongly support, including giving serv-icemen and women a well-deserved raise of 2.4 percent. Those who serve in uniform have made extraordinary sacrifices for our country and have earned and deserve a pay raise. It also includes funding for Ukraine and Eastern Europe security initiatives to counter Russia’s heightened military provocations and annex-ation of Crimea. Despite these important initiatives, I have strong concerns with H.R. 2810. This legisla-tion authorizes more than $688.3 billion, which is $70.4 billion more than the FY 2017 author-ized level and $28.5 billion more than the president’s request. This includes $74.6 billion to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, an account which is not counted in the budget and is not paid for. It adds to the deficit and is used as a slush fund by the Pen-tagon. Unlike every other federal agency, the De-partment of Defense (DOD) refuses to com-plete a financial audit so taxpayers know how the biggest bureaucracy in the federal govern-ment spends their money. In fact, a shocking report released last December exposed $125 billion in administrative waste that the Pen-tagon tried to bury from being viewed by the public. I refuse to support increased bureaucratic waste at the expense of American taxpayers and our men and women in uniform. A more accountable and transparent department would ensure taxpayer dollars are directed to-wards the needs of our troops and the bene-fits they deserve, rather than buying unneces-sary weapon systems, sustaining a Cold War era military force, and giving the president a blank check to fund wars Congress hasn’t au-thorized. I have always advocated for maintaining Congress’s constitutionally-confirmed preroga-tive to declare war under the War Powers Act and limiting the President’s authority to en-gage in armed conflict without the consent of Congress. I strongly oppose the NDAA’s con-tinued authorization of spending for wars that are not congressionally approved. The Pen-tagon uses the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military Force (AUMF) to continue to justify the 16 years our troops have been fighting in the Middle East. In his short time in office. Presi-dent Trump has already sent troops to Iraq, Syria and elsewhere without seeking a new Authorization of Use of Military Force (AUMF), a violation of the War Powers Act. Additionally, the bill prohibits the closing of Guantanamo Bay, which costs more than $100 million each year to house 41 prisoners and has been used as a top recruiting tool by terrorists. Frankly, the prison at Guantanamo Bay has been a black eye for the United States, has eroded relationships with our al-lies, undermined U.S. missions abroad, and put U.S. citizens and our troops at risk of re-taliation. Congress can make responsible cuts to our defense budget without jeopardizing the safety of our troops or undermining our national se-curity. Fiscal responsibility and accountability at the Pentagon would allow for funds to be better spent supporting the basic needs of our troops, meeting our obligations to veterans of past wars, and ensuring our true defense needs are prioritized.

HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Louise Little, a native of Morganton who passed away on June 30. Louise was born and raised in our home of northeast Georgia. After graduating from Sa-cred Heart College, she moved back to the area to care for her friends and loved ones as a lab technician at the Rockford Clinic. With a passion for service, Louise used her time away from work to immerse herself in her community. She was actively involved in the Lions Club, where she received numerous awards for her dedication and selflessness to-wards others. On the political front, Louise was a leader who encouraged women to get more involved in politics. Her commitment to women earned her the position of president at her local chap-ter of the National Federation of Republican Women. Between that and her work with the local Republican party, she encouraged others to speak out and share their ideas. She believed that every voice matters and that every indi-vidual has the power to make a difference. Mr. Speaker, northeast Georgia is grateful for Louise Little. This woman lived a life com-mitted to helping others. She was determined to make her community and country a better place for everyone. While I’m sad to see the story of such an outstanding woman come to a close, I am thankful that Mrs. Little’s legacy will carry on among her neighbors.

The store later became ‘‘Alvin’s Island Stores,’’ with locations on Panama City Beach, Destin, Fort Walton, Pensacola Beach, Or-ange Beach, Alabama, and Gulf Shores, Ala-bama. Marion was an active member of St. Andrew United Methodist Church, the founding mem-ber of the Panama City Beach Women’s Club, and a member of the first Library Committee to bring a Public Library to Panama City Beach. She was instrumental in starting the first Chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star in Panama City Beach, working her way through the leadership within the Chapter, and eventually serving as the Chairman of the Cancer Fund from 2009 to 2010. Aside from her work in the community, Mar-ion enjoyed spending time traveling with her grandchildren and supporting her great-grand-children at local events.

INTRODUCTION OF THE BIKESHARE TRANSIT ACT OF 2017 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, America is in the middle of a bikeshare revolution. More than 100 communities have bikeshare systems, supporting a network of 4,800 sta-tions and over 42,000 bikes. Since 2010, rid-ers have taken more than 88 million trips, with the number of trips and systems increasing each year. Today, my community is celebrating the one-year anniversary of its BIKETOWN bikeshare launch. In the last year, more than 75,000 Portlanders and visitors have taken hundreds of thousands of trips, covering more than half a million miles and removing untold numbers of automobiles from city streets. The system’s success has already led to its expan-sion, giving more communities access to effi-cient, carbon-free transportation. The increased commercial investment around bikeshare stations and networks is driving economic development across the country. Systems are opening in communities of all sizes from Los Angeles and Cleveland to Topeka and Birmingham. While some existing bikeshare programs received federal dollars to develop their systems, the lack of an estab-lished funding source has proved an impedi-ment to many other projects. Since the term ‘‘bikeshare’’ is not defined in U.S. code or de-scribed by law as a form of transit, existing bikeshare systems and departments of trans-portation are forced to operate in a gray area, creating challenges for funding, maintaining, and administering these programs. Today, I am introducing the Bikeshare Tran-sit Act, legislation that will eliminate this gray area by defining bikeshare in statute and mak-ing bikeshare systems eligible to receive fund-ing to enhance related public transportation service or transit facilities. The bill allows fed-eral funding to be used for acquiring or replac-ing bikeshare-related equipment and con-structing bikeshare facilities. Bikeshare sys-tems will also be listed as eligible projects under the Congestion Mitigation and Air Qual-ity (CMAQ) Improvement Program. The Bikeshare Transit Act will remove sig-nificant barriers facing new and existing bikeshare projects applying for federal funding while underscoring that bikeshare programs drive economic development and are an im-portant part of bringing choice and adding value to America’s transportation system.

At 15 years of age, Rachel was the youngest player in the 2017 U.S. Women’s Open field. Rachel Heck is a sophomore at St. Agnes Academy with a stellar 4.7 GPA and has al-ready committed to attend Stanford University. She was selected to be the USA Today high school golfer of the year and The Commercial Appeal’s High School Golfer of the Year. Ra-chel qualified for the U.S. Women’s Open on her first attempt, taking one of two spots in the Braselton, Ga., sectional qualifier. Last September, Rachel won the TSSAA Di-vision II–AA girls state title. In June, she won the 2017 Rolex Girls Junior Championship. She’s No. 3 in the Golfweek/Sagarin Junior Rankings and is ranked second by the Amer-ican Junior Golf Association. Rachel Heck finished her first appearance at the U.S. Women’s Open at 2–over–290. Over-all, Rachel posted rounds of 72–74–72–72 while battling difficult conditions throughout, in-cluding heavy rains on Thursday and Friday. She finished 33rd in a six-way tie and placed 3rd amongst amateurs. Rachel Heck is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Memphis golfers ever.

Lori was a constituent and friend of mine, and I will miss her dearly. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends in this undoubt-edly difficult time. Lori contributed greatly to the growth of Democratic politics in Florida, specifically in Broward County. She was the president of the Sunrise Regular Democratic Club, and the past president of the Council of Democratic Club Presidents for Broward County. She held that position for 5 years, becoming the longest serving president in that organization’s history. She was also the past president of the Gold Coast Women’s Democratic Club of Broward County, and the Broward Democratic Party Area Leader for Sunrise, Plantation, North Lauderdale, and Tamarac. She was an elected Florida Delegate rep-resenting the 20th and 23rd Congressional Districts at every Democratic National Conven-tion from 1992 to 2008, and proudly served on numerous boards and committees both polit-ical and civil. Lori’s contributions to our community will be remembered for years to come. She is sur-vived by her husband, Craig Glasser of Sun-rise, Florida, and her son. May their faith bring comfort to them in their time of grief, and know that Lori’s spirit and loving memory will always live on.

RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL IMMIGRATION LAW CENTER 
HON. LUIS V. GUTIE´RREZ 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National Immigration Law Center for its leadership and decades-long commitment to defending and advancing the rights of immigrants with low income. On July 25th, the Coalition on Human Needs will rightfully honor the National Immi-gration Law Center as one of its Human Needs Heroes for the year. Since 1979, NILC has grown to be one of the premier immi-grants’ rights organizations, strategically using a combination of litigation, policy, communica-tions, and alliance-building strategies to effect social change. During my years in office, I have been proud to work with NILC to advance fair and moral immigration policies. During a debate that all too often plays to fear rather than fact, NILC works to make sure that policymakers remember the humanity of immigrants, their ir-replaceable contributions to our economy and culture, and the real effects these laws have on their lives. By defending immigrants’ rights to due process, fair treatment as workers, and preventing racial profiling, NILC has benefited our communities and strengthened our democ-racy. I have been proud to work with NILC on many important bills and advocacy efforts. Over the years, we have worked tirelessly to keep families together through deportation de-fense. We have fought to reverse cuts to im-migrant families’ welfare benefits. We have put our heads together to draft smart, fair, and hu-mane Comprehensive Immigration Reform and DREAM legislation to make immigration legal again and to protect young immigrants. We have advocated for immigrants’ health by cre-ating legislation that would allow undocu-mented immigrants to obtain healthcare through the Affordable Care Act. Today, we continue to work together to protect our coun-try’s immigrant community that is under the threat of mass detention, deportation, and overall criminalization of immigrants. Together, we have not and we will not back down from this threat. I am proud to be an ally of NILC, and I applaud them in their tireless commit-ment to creating fair and just immigration poli-cies. The National Immigration Law Center has been a trusted source of policy on the inter-section of poverty and immigration, an unyielding voice for making sure the debate on immigration reflects the lives of those that it affects, and a staunch defender of immigrant rights. It is my honor today to recognize the National Immigration Law Center for its dedi-cation and skill, as well as to thank them for all that they have done on behalf of immi-grants. f

HONORING THE SERVICE OF JUDGE DAMON J. KEITH 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, Jr. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize a great public servant and a brilliant jurist, Judge Damon J. Keith. Throughout his 50 years on the federal bench, Judge Keith has steadfastly and courageously protected the constitutional and civil rights of all Americans, and I am pleased that he will be honored to-night in a special event at the Supreme Court celebrating his outstanding career, and his service to the United States. Judge Keith was born on the Fourth of July in 1922. From an early age, he stood out as a scholar and an athlete. He graduated from Northwestern High School in Detroit, where he excelled in track and he went on to become the first in his family to earn a college degree, graduating from West Virginia State College in 1943. After serving in the U.S. Army for three years, he continued his education and earned his law degree from Howard University Law School in 1949. Judge Keith started his legal career in De-troit with the African-American law firm of Loomis, Jones, Piper & Colden, and he was one of six Detroit attorneys invited to the White House in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy to discuss the role of lawyers in the civil rights struggle. In 1967, he was appointed to the federal bench by President Lyndon Johnson, becom-ing only the second African-American to sit on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, and in 1975, he rose to become Chief Judge of that court. During his tenure on the District Court, Judge Keith delivered sev-eral key civil rights rulings on such important issues as school desegregation, employment and housing discrimination, and affirmative ac-tion. In 1971, Judge Keith issued a landmark civil liberties ruling in U.S. v. Sinclair, which found wiretap surveillance absent a court order in domestic security cases to be unconstitutional. This case came to be known as the ‘‘Keith de-cision’’ and it was unanimously upheld by the United States Supreme Court. His ruling is also widely acknowledged as contributing to passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-lance Act in 1975, which placed important re-strictions on government surveillance of Amer-icans. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Judge Keith to the United States Court of Ap-peals for the Sixth Circuit, where he has served with distinction. He took senior status in 1995, but he continues to be a vital member

of that Court. Just last year, his impassioned dissent in a voting rights case gained national recognition, as he recounted the ugly history of voter suppression in this country, and he stood up for the rights of all Americans to have their voices heard at the ballot box. Judge Keith is well deserving of the numer-ous honors and awards he has received throughout his career, including: the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s highest award, the Spingarn Medal, in 1974; the American Bar Association’s Thurgood Marshall Award in 1997; the Edward J. Devitt Award for Distinguished Service to Justice in 1998, presented by a panel com-prised of a United States Supreme Court Jus-tice, a federal circuit court judge, and a federal district court judge; and honorary degrees from Harvard University, Yale University, Georgetown University, the University of Michigan, Tuskegee University, and over thirty other institutions. Tonight, a distinguished panel that includes former Attorney General Eric Holder will be-stow one more honor, in recognition of his life-time of service as a defender of the Constitu-tion and the civil rights of all people. I am proud to call Judge Keith a mentor, a friend, and an inspiration.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF JAIME MARTINEZ 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Jaime Martinez, a son of San Antonio and civil rights leader who left an indelible mark on our city and nation. He was raised on the West Side of San Antonio by his grandparents, immi-grants to the United States who had an appre-ciation for President Franklin Delano Roo-sevelt that resonated with Jaime in his youth. They involved him at an early age in La Sociedad Mutualista Mexicana, which taught Jaime the importance of serving the commu-nity and helping others. After attending Lanier High School, Jaime pursued his passion for music, and toured with a number of bands across the United States and Canada before returning to San Antonio in 1966. Shortly after, he joined the Inter-national Union of Electrical Workers (IUE, now the IUE–AFL–CIO) Local 780. Jaime went on

to become the Secretary Treasurer for the Ex-ecutive Board of IUE District 11, the first Mexi-can American to do so at the national level, and served as the National Labor Coordinator for Coordinadora 96. A talented and passionate organizer, Jaime served as first vice president for the Central Labor Council of the AFL–CIO and as presi-dent of the national Labor Council of Latin American Advancement (LCLAA). Also a strong advocate for immigrant rights, Jaime founded and was president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) Council No. 4626 in San Antonio. Later, he became the National Chairperson of the Immi-gration Committee tor LCLAA and treasurer of LULAC at the national level. For nearly two decades, until his passing, Jaime also served as the founder and chairman of the Cesar Chavez Legacy and Educational Foundation. Jaime is survived by his wife, Maria Guada-lupe Martinez; his daughter, Sarah Marie Mar-tinez; his sons Ernest J. Martinez and Chris-topher Michael Martinez; his daughter-in-law Joyce A. Martinez; and his granddaughters Erika, Kayla, Amanda, and Sophia. I wish the entire Martinez family comfort and solace at this difficult time. Jaime’s life of leadership and service improved the lives of workers and im-migrants across the country. He will be missed.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF PHILIP FOREST 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Philip Forest, a native of Ellijay, who passed away on July 1. Mr. Forest lived a life committed to serving his country and helping his fellow citizens. When Philip graduated high school, he en-listed in the U.S. Army where he served in the Medical Services Unit and, over time, became an Intelligence Officer. After 16 years of serv-ice, Mr. Forest retired and began a new ca-reer—a career that spanned from the U.S. De-partment of Housing and Urban Development to the National Association of Homebuilders. Despite his demanding career, Mr. Forest still prioritized time for his friends and neigh-bors. When he moved to northeast Georgia, he became involved in the Georgia High Country Builders Association, from which he received a Lifetime Achievement Award, and was an active member at his local Republican Party. When I think of Philip Forest, I think of a man who wanted to serve his country in any and every capacity. Mr. Forest’s service was inexhaustible, and I hope his legacy encour-ages northeast Georgians for years to come.

RELATING TO A RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE 
HON. DAVID N. CICILLINE 
OF RHODE ISLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 19, 2017 Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, my resolution raises the question of the privileges of the House pursuant to Rule IX, clause 1, as it af-fects ‘‘the rights of the House collectively, its dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.’’ Insofar as it raises the House’s failure to un-dertake its constitutional responsibility of over-sight and the obligation of all elected officials to ensure decisions are made free of conflicts and with the public interest in mind. In particular, matters related to the House’s constitutionally granted powers have been rec-ognized as valid questions of the privileges of the House. The Origination Clause that re-quests revenue bills to originate in the House includes the issues related to revenues gen-erated by our tax code. Clearly the issues raised by this resolution cover those matters contemplated by the Origination Clause. There is nothing more of a threat to the in-tegrity of the House than ignoring our duty to provide a check and balance to the executive branch. To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request Presi-dent Trump’s tax returns and give the Amer-ican people the transparency they deserve. The stunning conflicts of interest are piling up as the President, his family, and his friends profit in their personal business endeavors while serving in public office. President Trump has not divested himself from his businesses as was recommended by the Office of Government Ethics. He is the sole beneficiary of the trust his sons now man-age and can still pull funds from it at any time. We need to see how the President would personally benefit from changes to our tax code. Tax code changes proposed by his ad-ministration could lower his own personal tax bill by tens of millions of dollars. The American people have a right to know. Mr. Trump fired the Director of the FBI, James Comey, and admitted he did so be-cause he didn’t like the investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russian officials. The following day, he wel-comed the Russian foreign minister and Rus-sian ambassador to the Oval Office with open arms, and revealed highly sensitive, classified information to them. And now we know that several members of the Trump Campaign and President Trump’s inner circle met with a Russian lawyer and in-telligence agent during the campaign, hoping to get incriminating information against Hillary Clinton. Yet to this day, we have no way of knowing President Trump’s or the various Trump orga-nizations’ ties to Russia. We don’t know whether Trump or his firms have received Russian income or loans or entered into Rus-sian-linked partnerships. A ‘‘certified’’ letter from paid attorneys does nothing to assuage these concerns. The Legislative Branch has the responsi-bility and the authority to check the Executive Branch and Section 6103 of the tax code al-lows for an examination of his tax returns—au-thority put in place specifically so Congress could examine conflicts of interest in the Exec-utive following the Teapot Dome scandal. We cannot ignore our duty to fully examine the personal financial entanglements this President may have with Russian entities and individuals and whether he has abused the tax laws of this country. We have nothing but evidence to justify such an examination. If and when such con-flicts are revealed, I do not want to say to our constituents that we had the power to review these conflicts, but we did nothing. I for one do not want my integrity or the integrity of my colleagues in this body to be demeaned by such a shameful failure. To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request President Trump’s tax returns and give the American people the transparency they deserve.
